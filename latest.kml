					[[File:IIT Ropar - Main Building of the Transit Campus.JPG|thumbnail|IIT Ropar transit campus]]
					The temporary campus of IIT Ropar is former Women's Polytechnic, Rupnagar. The academic and administration buildings of the Women's Polytechnic, Ropar were renovated to accommodate all the requirements of the Institute.

					The temporary campus houses four hostels: three for boys (Mercury Wings A, B &amp; C, Jupiter and Neptune Houses) and one for girls (Venus House). The day-to-day management of hostels is taken care of by a committee consisting of student representatives, faculty members (as Wardens) and administrative staff (caretakers, office-heads). The institute has an independent post office and a branch of [[State Bank of India]] (SBI). There is also a central library in the campus, offering about 4,000 books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.iitrpr.ac.in/html/centrallibrary.shtml | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120504024741/http://www.iitrpr.ac.in/html/centrallibrary.shtml | archivedate = 4 May 2012 | title = Central Library | publisher = Indian Institute of Technology Ropar | accessdate = 6 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

					Sport facilities include a cricket field, three tennis courts, a football field, a gymnasium, a basketball court, two volleyball court and also a number of facilities for several athletics. The Students Activity Center (SAC) has a gymnasium and rooms for different activity clubs.

					Owing to the Center's order for increasing seats in IITs, another Transit Campus (Transit Campus 2) is also actively functional. It's called the NIELIT campus (National Institute for Electrical And Information Technology). It's located next to where the permanent campus is being built. This campus has 2 boys' hostels, 1 girls' hostel and the main academic arena. Since the campus is new, it has trees in the budding phase, so it's hot here during the day. IIT Ropar buses ply between both the campuses many times a day. This campus has a short life under IIT Ropar and once some departments are made in the Permanent Campus, IIT Ropar will lose it's hold from here.[[File:Iit rpr.jpg|thumbnail|Football Ground]]
