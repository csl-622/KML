Richard wrote a post encouraging voting. I think this is a big issue because rep is the basis of our &quot;economy&quot;, encourages (good) user activity, sorts out our content and makes the site look active. In particular **Question Votes** make the site look more active.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I cannot state this strongly enough.  Voting is *absolutely critical* to the formation of a healthy SE site.  And this is never more true than in Private and early Public beta.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Questions&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting allows the community to determine what topics are allowed and what are not.  Voting shows what constitutes a well-formed question and what is unacceptable for this community.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help formulating better questions, the blog post [Asking Better Questions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/asking-better-questions/) might help you out.  (Admittedly, it's geared towards the Stackoverflow crowd, but the philosophies there will help).  Also, [How to Ask](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask) directly from StackOverflow is an excellent resource.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;Finally, I want to reiterate that **Voting on questions  is free!**  It doesn't cost you any reputation to to vote a question down.  (Compared to answers:)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Answers&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting on answers allows a dramatic increase in reputation.  Like questions, it shows that you believe and support the answer provided.  Also, vote answers up that you think are well worded and support the answer given.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; *You don't have to agree with an answer to vote it up!*&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show that this is true, they've even created a [badge for voting up competing answers (called &quot;Sportsmanship&quot;)](http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badges/63/sportsmanship).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;If you think an answer is *useful*, vote it up.  If you think an answer is *not useful*, vote it down.  Either way, **vote**!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help on writing answers, the meta post [How do I write a good answer to a question?](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7656/how-do-i-write-a-good-answer-to-a-question) will help you out.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Final thoughts&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If people do not vote, there won't be enough reputation on this site for it to be promoted.  Reputation is very important to a StackExchange site as it creates the groups of people capable of maintaining the site.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show how critical it is, Jeff Atwood posted a blog article regarding this topic: [Vote Early, Vote Often](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Encourage others to vote!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Quoting RobertCartaino from chat:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; Vote, vote, vote. Encourage others to vote, vote, vote. On good content, leave signposts (&quot;If you like this, please vote it up. It's important for the community!&quot;)-- in both meta and the main site. Maybe a few meta posts informing the users of the important of that type of participation. You are empowered a lot more than you know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't upvote bad content (edit/suggest how to fix it instead) but make sure you remember to vote, especially for questions; if you learned something from an answer on a question, the question's probably worth an upvote too so others can find the good information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [![https://blog.stackexchange.com/images/wordpress/vote-here.jpg][1]]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://blog.stackexchange.com/images/wordpress/vote-here.jpg" />

Sometimes that involves not going to what they directly wrote, because sometimes that's not the most effective way to go about it. For much the same as there are people who can't use alternatives, there are people who didn't *think* about the alternative options in the first place. It's very easy when some askers run into a problem, to tunnel-vision that &quot;I must solve it this way&quot; and then someone provides a very enlightening view by working outside the box the asker had situated inside. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, this is also part of the very nature as to why these sites permit more than one answer to a question. It is to allow different routes to solve the same problem. Some will be the direct route that is asked, others will take shortcuts as they see fit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It remains though that naturally, sometimes an alternative, be it a particular one or just in general, is not permissible. When this is the case, that kind of a restriction is *part of the problem*. As such if the asker can't work with a given alternative, and if the only answers they're getting is that alternative, it's to them to modify their question to exclude that alternative as an option. Or if it is a known quantity to begin with, a pre-emptitive exclusion present in the question when asked is very appropriate. On the other side, if a reader happens upon a question and cannot utilize the alternatives that exist there, then they are welcome to recreate the question in a fashion which excludes the alternatives since their situation cannot cater to it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sans such an explicit exclusion, if the asker can work with the alternative, or if they still receive other answers that do not employ that alternative, there's no foul going on as a result. It's fine to dislike something being provided as an alternative, but it's by no means something we're going to discourage on a level to the point of flagging. Downvotes, those are yours to give as you see fit to things that you believe are not helpful - I could say something like &quot;It's probably more appropriate to downvote if a particular alternative is actively unhelpful to you, as opposed to a post which you stumble across in random browsing which just *happens* to be an alternative&quot;, but at the same vein, you could still deem it unhelpful and the vote is yours to cast.

There were some issues when HSM sprang up, because Mathematics, Physics, and other sites allowed history-related questions. I participated in several meta discussions on these sites. While Physics eventually decided to not allow history questions, Mathematics and other sites continued to allow them. So we should not make our decision based on Law.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I do agree that, so far, the [tag:legal] questions have not been great. But in the future, they could be. I wrote in [a comment](http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/103/is-it-legal-to-make-a-weapon-with-a-3d-printer#comment123_1030)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I agree with @TomvanderZanden; a good case could be made for keeping this here. Laws and regulations can be a huge influence on an industry; the allowance or ban of certain products of said industry would seem to be relevant here. Remember, questions can be on-topic on multiple sites.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regulatory measures can be extraordinarily important in a industry. If we had a site about making socks, should questions about whether or not is is legal to make socks with material X in the United States be off topic? I would argue no; this could be an important part of sock-making.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We have the same situation here. Some [tag:legal] questions can be important; I would argue that questions regarding which materials and devices are legal should be ones we aim for. The legality of Filament A could be really important to a project.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's not to say that all [tag:legal] questions are fine. As has been said, some of the ones we've had so far haven't been great, and I would advocate sending them to Law. But I strongly disagree that just because of the examples we've seen we should not allow [tag:legal] questions. There are good ones out there; we haven't seen their full extent yet." />

We may link to outside models, but the core API should be servable by stack exchange without license or much maintenance so 1) we don't have to deal with API changes messing us up, 2) we don't rely on outside services that may change their terms of use or API, 3) we don't have to form complicated contract bound relationships with 3rd parties just to get the guarantees we'd need to convince Stack Exchange to invest in a new feature, and 4) we don't become too politically involved such that we disenfranchise users who may have very strong feelings about this subject.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Wait and see&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is the early beta.  Let's find out what people link to in questions before dedicating resources to improving the links/plug-ins/oneboxes.

But when I started 3D-printing, that's certainly where a large part of my questions lay. It's because the materials are DIFFERENT than ones we're used to dealing with, and if it weren't for 3D-printing, I wouldn't have been working with them then. It's BECAUSE I was 3D-printing that the questions arose. There are certainly similarities between the materials used for 3D-printing and other materials we might run into, but there are also vast differences. For example, ABS is the same plastic that we know from Legos. But how does working with the plastic that's been 3D-printed differ from working with a Lego? I would consider any question about that area to be valid. You mention drilling plastic, but then got the answer wrong. It is NOT like drilling wood; the way you drill plastic should be different from how you deal with wood, such as the speeds used and the use of hand drills. There are even special plastic bits that you can buy that make it easier to drill plastic. Good questions might be: for PLA, ABS and other 3dpg plastics, when is it appropriate to use such bits and when can you get away with using high speed drill bits like you would use for wood? Are higher drill speeds better than lower speeds for some 3D-printed plastics and not others, or vice versa?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In summary, I feel that questions about a technique or material that is being used in the 3D-printing process, or dealing with the materials afterward, should be valid because 3D-printing changes how the techniques are done or the materials are dealt with." />

As such, I disagree with [tbm0115's suggestion][2] that we should artificially delay closing a question (at this stage in the sites life there aren't enough people closing questions as it is) and suggest that we always close a poor question as soon as possible, but give people the information they need to fix the problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead, I offer the following suggestion:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If you want to vote to close a question without writing a comment to say why, with suggestions as to how to fix the problem, think about how this looks to a new user and how they might feel about the *rejection*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If people assume there is nothing they can do about their question being closed, and this drives them away, then we should do all we can to correct that misunderstanding, encourage them to learn how Stack Exchange works and ask better questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, don't forget the importance of [broken windows theory][3].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The quicker poor questions are closed, the higher the good:bad question ratio is, the more likely new users will see examples of good questions, and the less likely that they will base their own question on a poor example of a question. This is why good questions are the most important thing on a new site. They draw in experts to answer them and they set a good example for how new questions should be framed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, close early, close often, and comment with the information needed to get the question re-opened.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.robotics.stackexchange.com/a/177/37&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://meta.3dprinting.stackexchange.com/a/112/63&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory" />

I personally find the structure of the StackExchange sites easy to navigate and appreciate the amount of moderation that goes into each site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Search Engines#&#xD;&#xA;Most traffic will most likely come from search engines (ie Google, Yahoo, etc.) which can find the questions/answers easiest from the use of Tags here on StackExchange.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, the first thing to keep in mind is ensuring the tags you use are plenty and accurate with each question you ask. This will help increase the chances of a search engine showing your question higher in its results list.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another factor, with regard to search engines, is the title of the question. Generally people are going to be more attracted to a specific question as they feel it will answer their question better. For example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;***Extruder keeps jamming*** as a question title will probably not attract users to view the question as it is very vague.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;***MakerBot Replicator extruder jams with new filament*** as a question title is more specific and contains more &quot;keywords&quot; that a search engine can find. Obviously, this can also potentially deter certain users (say Ultimaker users), but the hope is that the tag system will help offset this issue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Etiquette#&#xD;&#xA;I agree with you in that I also find it difficult to &quot;advertise&quot; the 3D printing community on other websites. As it may be considered improper etiquette here on the StackExchange network to advertise or promote other websites, I wouldn't recommend &quot;advertising&quot; the community as a whole. However, if you notice, many answers on the StackExchange network include links to other forum or Q&amp;A sites (ie MSDN, CodeProject, etc.). With this in mind, I personally feel that it is appropriate to post links to specific questions here on the 3D Printing community on another site if it can benefit the users on the other site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are wanting to personally focus on bringing more traffic, you could participate on some of the forums you mentioned and try providing relevant links to this community. But, in the interest of maintaining quality on both websites, please remain respectful and courteous.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;Hopefully this helps" />

This just allows you to make copies of an existing model.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we want to allow these types of questions, we should get the name of this site changed (to something like &quot;Makers SE&quot;/&quot;Rapid Prototyping&quot;). I don't know if that's even an option, but as it stands, &quot;3D printing SE&quot; should be about 3D printing; CNC mills, vacuum formers, etc... are *clearly not 3D printers* and thus off-topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't find &quot;there's no other place for this&quot; to be a convincing argument; the scope of a site should not depend on what other sites do or do not exist.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, I do feel the just 3D printing scope is a bit limited and we could attract a larger audience by including other types of rapid prototyping/manufacturing. The name would be a huge misnomer if the scope included that, but I guess the only way to get a name change (if that is possible/appropriate at all) is to begin by changing the scope.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As it stands, the question referenced in the post is definitely not on-topic (since the machine involved is very un-printer-like), but questions about CNC machines (and similar machines) *might* be. They mostly run different softwares (GRBL/Mach3) but you could conceivably run a CNC machine on Marlin." />

The problem is that Stack Exchange isn't meant to be a search engine or a list of links. We have Google for that. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Our role in making the Internet a better place is in curating a high-quality collection of crowd-sourced knowledge. Stack Exchange rates very highly among search engines, so when someone clicks through thinking they finally found an answer from a highly-trusted source, **we have a responsibility *not* to purport having information we do not.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sometimes it's better to accept not-perfect-answer than leave the man with no answer at all&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's a well-meaning consideration, but it ignores the purpose of curating this content as a whole. You may help that *one* person in the minimal possible sense&amp;hellip; but for the hundreds (sometimes *thousands*) of people who come after, all we did was create yet **another barrier** between the user and the information they were searching for.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That does not make the Internet better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Redirecting users elsewhere can also displace folks who may have posted a *proper* answer. Few people are actually privy to these meta discussions and what makes these Stack Exchange sites &quot;work&quot;, so oftentimes users looking on will largely consider the issue *resolved.* Folks mostly emulate the practices and methods they see, so if cutting and pasting a link serves as an answer, then *everyone* can do it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And in that vein, please do not answer questions in comments. Comments do not have the voting and the wiki-style editing features which allow us to properly vet and improve this content.

Winter Bash is an annual event that can run on any Stack Exchange site that chooses to participate. Users have fun by earning “hats” for their gravatars by completing certain tasks (very similar to badges). We track everyone’s progress using hats in a leaderboard that looks similar to this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [![hats][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; As always, we’re coming up with new hat designs for this year’s fun!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **The Details**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The event will run from 19 December 2016 up to and including 08 January 2017. Users will be able to see all the hats they’ve earned on http://winterbash2016.stackexchange.com. That site will also have a landing page, explaining the rules and other details of the event. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Individual users who don’t want to participate, don’t want to see hats, and/or are generally anti-hat will have an “I hate hats” option available. And just like last time, at the end of the event, all hats will go back into storage. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The only visual change to the Stack Exchange sites themselves will be the presence of the hats and the “I hate hats” button in the footer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://stackpromos.com/promos/16/winter-bash-2015&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/OohHZ.jpg" />

Most of my questions/answers have received votes, whereas on other (nameless) sites, I have posted a number of questions/answers and not received [m]any votes at all. However, this must be my (inaccurate) perception, as the stats shows that the voting is not at the desired levels.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While it is important to votes and vote often, it is worth remembering that we shouldn't just vote willy-nilly. I have noticed that some beta sites, especially in the early days, tend to get rather frenzied (or, if you will, overly enthusiastic) voting, which one does not necessarily see in the more established sites, where the voting has settled down and only the (oft mentioned) *awesome* answers are voted for. This overly enthusiastic voting can *sometimes* end up giving random votes to questions that are not particularly researched, or answers that are not fully accurate, which maybe do not deserve any votes at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am not sure why this (comparatively) frenzied voting occurs, or why it dies down, nor am I sure what (which?) level of voting is appropriate - although it is obvious that poorly researched questions and inaccurate answers should not be voted up. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regardless, I would agree that voting *does* act as an incentive to contribute to the site, as well as the idea that voting for a good question, or accurate answer, even if that question/answer does not apply directly to you, because it will help other users.

Richard wrote a post encouraging voting. I think this is a big issue because rep is the basis of our &quot;economy&quot;, encourages (good) user activity, sorts out our content and makes the site look active. In particular **Question Votes** make the site look more active.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I cannot state this strongly enough.  Voting is *absolutely critical* to the formation of a healthy SE site.  And this is never more true than in Private and early Public beta.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Questions&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting allows the community to determine what topics are allowed and what are not.  Voting shows what constitutes a well-formed question and what is unacceptable for this community.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help formulating better questions, the blog post [Asking Better Questions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/asking-better-questions/) might help you out.  (Admittedly, it's geared towards the Stackoverflow crowd, but the philosophies there will help).  Also, [How to Ask](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask) directly from StackOverflow is an excellent resource.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;Finally, I want to reiterate that **Voting on questions  is free!**  It doesn't cost you any reputation to to vote a question down.  (Compared to answers:)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Answers&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting on answers allows a dramatic increase in reputation.  Like questions, it shows that you believe and support the answer provided.  Also, vote answers up that you think are well worded and support the answer given.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; *You don't have to agree with an answer to vote it up!*&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show that this is true, they've even created a [badge for voting up competing answers (called &quot;Sportsmanship&quot;)](http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badges/63/sportsmanship).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;If you think an answer is *useful*, vote it up.  If you think an answer is *not useful*, vote it down.  Either way, **vote**!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help on writing answers, the meta post [How do I write a good answer to a question?](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7656/how-do-i-write-a-good-answer-to-a-question) will help you out.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Final thoughts&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If people do not vote, there won't be enough reputation on this site for it to be promoted.  Reputation is very important to a StackExchange site as it creates the groups of people capable of maintaining the site.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show how critical it is, Jeff Atwood posted a blog article regarding this topic: [Vote Early, Vote Often](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Encourage others to vote!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Quoting RobertCartaino from chat:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; Vote, vote, vote. Encourage others to vote, vote, vote. On good content, leave signposts (&quot;If you like this, please vote it up. It's important for the community!&quot;)-- in both meta and the main site. Maybe a few meta posts informing the users of the important of that type of participation.

Besides the normal abilities of a Moderator, they will:&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Have access to a special chat room where we will collectively work through the challenges of moderation and community self-policing.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Organize the process of selecting the site's attributes (domain names, design issues, the FAQ, etc.).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Rally community support and drive the mission of getting publicity for the site.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Essentially, **they will have the ear of the Stack Exchange team for anything we can do to help their sites succeed!**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although the moderators pro tempore will ultimately be selected by Stack Exchange, the purpose of this post is to seek out and propose candidates:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Each nomination should be posted as an answer and it should include (at minimum) a link to the user's main and meta profile so we can check out their activity.&#xD;&#xA;- Self nominations are encouraged, step up if you feel you can help.&#xD;&#xA;- If you are nominated by someone else you should edit the answer and let us know if you accept or decline (explanation optional). If a nominee declines we will not delete the answer, as to not have someone else nominate them again.&#xD;&#xA;- If you are nominating someone else, please mark the post as Community Wiki before saving. Meta doesn't allow suggested edits, so your nominee may be blocked from accepting the nomination.&#xD;&#xA;- The nominations are not binding to Stack Exchange or the nominees. If you are being considered by Stack Exchange, you will get an official confirmation email at one point. &#xD;&#xA;- Before nominating someone or accept / decline a nomination, you should read [*A Theory of Moderation*][2] thoroughly to find out what's generally expected from moderators.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you would like to learn more about the role, please drop into [chat room][3] where you can ask about the role from other moderators (they appear with a blue name in the chat room).

Richard wrote a post encouraging voting. I think this is a big issue because rep is the basis of our &quot;economy&quot;, encourages (good) user activity, sorts out our content and makes the site look active. In particular **Question Votes** make the site look more active.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I cannot state this strongly enough.  Voting is *absolutely critical* to the formation of a healthy SE site.  And this is never more true than in Private and early Public beta.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Questions&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting allows the community to determine what topics are allowed and what are not.  Voting shows what constitutes a well-formed question and what is unacceptable for this community.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help formulating better questions, the blog post [Asking Better Questions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/asking-better-questions/) might help you out.  (Admittedly, it's geared towards the Stackoverflow crowd, but the philosophies there will help).  Also, [How to Ask](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask) directly from StackOverflow is an excellent resource.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;Finally, I want to reiterate that **Voting on questions  is free!**  It doesn't cost you any reputation to to vote a question down.  (Compared to answers:)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Answers&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting on answers allows a dramatic increase in reputation.  Like questions, it shows that you believe and support the answer provided.  Also, vote answers up that you think are well worded and support the answer given.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; *You don't have to agree with an answer to vote it up!*&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show that this is true, they've even created a [badge for voting up competing answers (called &quot;Sportsmanship&quot;)](http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badges/63/sportsmanship).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;If you think an answer is *useful*, vote it up.  If you think an answer is *not useful*, vote it down.  Either way, **vote**!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help on writing answers, the meta post [How do I write a good answer to a question?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7656/how-do-i-write-a-good-answer-to-a-question) will help you out.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Final thoughts&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If people do not vote, there won't be enough reputation on this site for it to be promoted.  Reputation is very important to a StackExchange site as it creates the groups of people capable of maintaining the site.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show how critical it is, Jeff Atwood posted a blog article regarding this topic: [Vote Early, Vote Often](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Encourage others to vote!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Quoting RobertCartaino from chat:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; Vote, vote, vote. Encourage others to vote, vote, vote. On good content, leave signposts (&quot;If you like this, please vote it up. It's important for the community!&quot;)-- in both meta and the main site. Maybe a few meta posts informing the users of the important of that type of participation. You are empowered a lot more than you know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't upvote bad content (edit/suggest how to fix it instead) but make sure you remember to vote, especially for questions; if you learned something from an answer on a question, the question's probably worth an upvote too so others can find the good information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [![https://blog.stackexchange.com/images/wordpress/vote-here.jpg][1]]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://blog.stackexchange.com/images/wordpress/vote-here.jpg" />

Richard wrote a post encouraging voting. I think this is a big issue because rep is the basis of our &quot;economy&quot;, encourages (good) user activity, sorts out our content and makes the site look active. In particular **Question Votes** make the site look more active.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I cannot state this strongly enough.  Voting is *absolutely critical* to the formation of a healthy SE site.  And this is never more true than in Private and early Public beta.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Questions&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting allows the community to determine what topics are allowed and what are not.  Voting shows what constitutes a well-formed question and what is unacceptable for this community.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help formulating better questions, the blog post [Asking Better Questions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/asking-better-questions/) might help you out.  (Admittedly, it's geared towards the Stackoverflow crowd, but the philosophies there will help).  Also, [How to Ask](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask) directly from StackOverflow is an excellent resource.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;Finally, I want to reiterate that **Voting on questions  is free!**  It doesn't cost you any reputation to to vote a question down.  (Compared to answers:)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Answers&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting on answers allows a dramatic increase in reputation.  Like questions, it shows that you believe and support the answer provided.  Also, vote answers up that you think are well worded and support the answer given.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; *You don't have to agree with an answer to vote it up!*&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show that this is true, they've even created a [badge for voting up competing answers (called &quot;Sportsmanship&quot;)](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badges/63/sportsmanship).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;If you think an answer is *useful*, vote it up.  If you think an answer is *not useful*, vote it down.  Either way, **vote**!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help on writing answers, the meta post [How do I write a good answer to a question?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7656/how-do-i-write-a-good-answer-to-a-question) will help you out.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Final thoughts&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If people do not vote, there won't be enough reputation on this site for it to be promoted.  Reputation is very important to a StackExchange site as it creates the groups of people capable of maintaining the site.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show how critical it is, Jeff Atwood posted a blog article regarding this topic: [Vote Early, Vote Often](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Encourage others to vote!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Quoting RobertCartaino from chat:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; Vote, vote, vote. Encourage others to vote, vote, vote. On good content, leave signposts (&quot;If you like this, please vote it up. It's important for the community!&quot;)-- in both meta and the main site. Maybe a few meta posts informing the users of the important of that type of participation. You are empowered a lot more than you know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't upvote bad content (edit/suggest how to fix it instead) but make sure you remember to vote, especially for questions; if you learned something from an answer on a question, the question's probably worth an upvote too so others can find the good information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [![https://blog.stackexchange.com/images/wordpress/vote-here.jpg][1]]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://blog.stackexchange.com/images/wordpress/vote-here.jpg" />

There were some issues when HSM sprang up, because Mathematics, Physics, and other sites allowed history-related questions. I participated in several meta discussions on these sites. While Physics eventually decided to not allow history questions, Mathematics and other sites continued to allow them. So we should not make our decision based on Law.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I do agree that, so far, the [tag:legal] questions have not been great. But in the future, they could be. I wrote in [a comment](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/103/is-it-legal-to-make-a-weapon-with-a-3d-printer#comment123_1030)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I agree with @TomvanderZanden; a good case could be made for keeping this here. Laws and regulations can be a huge influence on an industry; the allowance or ban of certain products of said industry would seem to be relevant here. Remember, questions can be on-topic on multiple sites.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regulatory measures can be extraordinarily important in a industry. If we had a site about making socks, should questions about whether or not is is legal to make socks with material X in the United States be off topic? I would argue no; this could be an important part of sock-making.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We have the same situation here. Some [tag:legal] questions can be important; I would argue that questions regarding which materials and devices are legal should be ones we aim for. The legality of Filament A could be really important to a project.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's not to say that all [tag:legal] questions are fine. As has been said, some of the ones we've had so far haven't been great, and I would advocate sending them to Law. But I strongly disagree that just because of the examples we've seen we should not allow [tag:legal] questions. There are good ones out there; we haven't seen their full extent yet." />

PLA&lt;sup&gt;[filament]&lt;/sup&gt;, ABS&lt;sup&gt;[filament]&lt;/sup&gt;, Stainless Steel&lt;sup&gt;[powder]&lt;/sup&gt;, Bronze&lt;sup&gt;[powder]&lt;/sup&gt;, etc.).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Focusing on material questions may be a good start to the concern. While it may be technically *too broad* asking materials questions, in reality, most questions (in FDM/FFF realm) are going to be either about PLA or ABS (maybe Nylon) unless there is a specified purpose for the object. So, if a user specifies (or hints) the preferred printing method (FDM/FFF, SLA, etc.) then I think we should let people use their better judgment in answering the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Would it be appropriate to consider re-opening closed questions with the before mentioned criteria?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/search?q=closed%3Ayes&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/111/closing-locking-too-many-questions" />

Richard wrote a post encouraging voting. I think this is a big issue because rep is the basis of our &quot;economy&quot;, encourages (good) user activity, sorts out our content and makes the site look active. In particular **Question Votes** make the site look more active.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I cannot state this strongly enough.  Voting is *absolutely critical* to the formation of a healthy SE site.  And this is never more true than in Private and early Public beta.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Questions&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting allows the community to determine what topics are allowed and what are not.  Voting shows what constitutes a well-formed question and what is unacceptable for this community.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help formulating better questions, the blog post [Asking Better Questions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/asking-better-questions/) might help you out.  (Admittedly, it's geared towards the Stackoverflow crowd, but the philosophies there will help).  Also, [How to Ask](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask) directly from StackOverflow is an excellent resource.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;Finally, I want to reiterate that **Voting on questions  is free!**  It doesn't cost you any reputation to to vote a question down.  (Compared to answers:)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Answers&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting on answers allows a dramatic increase in reputation.  Like questions, it shows that you believe and support the answer provided.  Also, vote answers up that you think are well worded and support the answer given.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; *You don't have to agree with an answer to vote it up!*&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show that this is true, they've even created a [badge for voting up competing answers (called &quot;Sportsmanship&quot;)](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badges/63/sportsmanship).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;If you think an answer is *useful*, vote it up.  If you think an answer is *not useful*, vote it down.  Either way, **vote**!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help on writing answers, the meta post [How do I write a good answer to a question?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7656/how-do-i-write-a-good-answer-to-a-question) will help you out.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Final thoughts&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If people do not vote, there won't be enough reputation on this site for it to be promoted.  Reputation is very important to a StackExchange site as it creates the groups of people capable of maintaining the site.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show how critical it is, Jeff Atwood posted a blog article regarding this topic: [Vote Early, Vote Often](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Encourage others to vote!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Quoting RobertCartaino from chat:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; Vote, vote, vote. Encourage others to vote, vote, vote. On good content, leave signposts (&quot;If you like this, please vote it up. It's important for the community!&quot;)-- in both meta and the main site. Maybe a few meta posts informing the users of the important of that type of participation. You are empowered a lot more than you know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't upvote bad content (edit/suggest how to fix it instead) but make sure you remember to vote, especially for questions; if you learned something from an answer on a question, the question's probably worth an upvote too so others can find the good information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [![https://blog.stackexchange.com/images/wordpress/vote-here.jpg][1]]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://blog.stackexchange.com/images/wordpress/vote-here.jpg" />

It doesn't always work, depending on the length of time that the question has been posted for and some other factors, but often it does work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answer to &quot;Why?&quot; is simply because it hasn't been set up by the moderators. Generally, a specific migration &quot;pathway&quot; has to be agreed between sites, I think, and only then is that particular SE site *manually added* as an option to the migration dialog. There is a post, from a few years ago, on SE.Arduino - See [Why does the migrate dialog only list Arduino Meta?](https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2340/why-does-the-migrate-dialog-only-list-arduino-meta). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Actually, I was mistaken, although, I am sure that I heard the above from someone, somewhere. Apparently, it is because SE 3D Printing is still in beta:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I think it is because we are &quot;only&quot; a Beta site. Once we graduate, I&#xD;&#xA;&gt; think more migrating options become available.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; As a moderator, I can migrate to other sites, and have done in some&#xD;&#xA;&gt; cases. I usually ask their moderators first, and quite often they&#xD;&#xA;&gt; decline to accept them. However migration does happen.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; I think there is some rule that Beta sites don't get to migrate to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; other sites. I'm not quite sure why such a rule exists (it would seem&#xD;&#xA;&gt; more logical for it to be the other way).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;See also, from SE Robotics, [Closing a question - only option for another site is Robotics Meta][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ### Migrating to an arbitrary stack exchange site&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; This is only an option for ♦ moderators, so instead of voting to close&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the question &lt;sup&gt;&amp;dagger;&lt;/sup&gt; you should flag it for moderator&#xD;&#xA;&gt; attention &lt;sup&gt;&amp;ddagger;&lt;/sup&gt; with a suggestion of where it should be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; migrated.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; On established sites, migration paths are created to allow migration&#xD;&#xA;&gt; without moderator approval, but any migrations outside of those&#xD;&#xA;&gt; pathways still have to be handled by a moderator. The reason for this&#xD;&#xA;&gt; is because...&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ### This specific question&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; This question would not be a good candidate for migration. We try not&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to migrate questions which would just be closed on the target site for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; another reason. In this case, it is a very broad question. It could be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; edited to be a more *[practical, answerable questions based on actual&#xD;&#xA;&gt; problems faced](https://robotics.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask)* but&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that may invalidate the existing answer, which is pretty good, given&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the limitations of the question.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If neither [Computer Science][2] nor [Signal Processing][3] want this&#xD;&#xA;&gt; question, I'm happy for it to remain on *robitics*, since there are&#xD;&#xA;&gt; robotic applications of the answer to this question.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &amp;dagger;&lt;sub&gt; *close &gt; off-topic because... &gt; This question belongs on&#xD;&#xA;&gt; another site in the Stack Exchange network*&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &amp;ddagger;&lt;sub&gt; *flag &gt;  in need of moderator intervention*&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;See also [What are the limitations in Beta][4], in particular [animuson's answer][5]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Beta sites don't have default migration paths (although moderators can still migrate to/from).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://robotics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1287/closing-a-question-only-option-for-another-site-is-robotics-meta&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://cs.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://dsp.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/296832/what-are-the-limitations-in-beta&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/296832/what-are-the-limitations-in-beta#answer-296833" />

Not sure what would go in it though - do you have any concrete examples of blog ideas? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I already have a (messy) [blog][1], and I am not sure if I could also write a blog on here too. I wonder what the score is regarding duplicating personal blogs on to SE blogs? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Content&#xD;&#xA;An SE 3D print blog could be a good idea for ***Build Logs***, for example, maybe. Or maybe a page that links to other people's superlative build logs, [David Crocker's blogs](https://miscsolutions.wordpress.com/) come to mind.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is the blog (unlike the SE Q&amp;A site) allowed to contain ***links to cheap items/suppliers***? Apparently, reviews are allowed, from [Blog Overflow][2]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Review a product**. Reviews don’t fit the Q&amp;A nature of the sites, but these rules don’t apply on the blog!  Between a review written by a random person on the internet and a review written by a user on the site who consistently gets a lot of upvotes, which review would you trust more?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This closed question would have fitted into a blog nicely: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/4279/what-is-3d-printing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Concerns&#xD;&#xA;So, yes, I think it would be worth starting one up and seeing how it goes... although I would be a little concerned about the regularity of posts: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Plan a schedule**. Given the results of steps #2 and #3, think about a rough idea of a schedule for the blog. Will there be one post a week, posted Mondays? Will there be posts on Tuesdays and posts on Fridays? You don’t need to be pushing out posts daily, but you should post at least once a week.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*and*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Pick a posting schedule and stick to it**. It is easier to simply keep up from the get go than catch up if you fall behind.  Have a couple draft posts stashed away for a rainy day, ready to go that can be published if there is a lull.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, who would coordinate it? Are you putting yourself forward?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Have someone holding the reins**. This person doesn’t need to be the one writing all the posts, just someone that helps coordinate who is writing what and when it is getting posted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, it *is* a bit of a misfortune that Blog Overflow has a rather unfortunately acronym (as well as sounding like *Bog* Overflow).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://gr33nonline.wordpress.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/06/23/blog-overflow/" />

I'm currently using insights I obtained from mucking about with a 3D printer with Arduino Mega 2560 and RAMPS 1.4 to dive into retrofitting an elderly CNC router (but, as a router, still, not as a printer) with a new control system (presently thinking and have on order Arduino Uno R3 and Arduino CNC shield R3, we'll see how implementation goes on those) and was wondering if I could ask questions here that would overlap, or not, as I don't think there's a CNC/subtractive community similar to this 3DP/additive one in the ecosystem yet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I actually started out thinking I could just use the same controller setup (there's plenty of stepper driver slots available, and going &quot;dual-purpose&quot; cut and print is potentially interesting) but it seems the official GRBL fork is not 2560 compatible, though there is a fork to try and make it so - it seemed more of a sure bet to stick with the &quot;official&quot; fork and the common hardware.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Likewise I've seen a bit of chatter about making Marlin switch-hit CNC/3DP, but I get the impression it's not all there yet, and I'm more interested in immediately usable based on current/past efforts than trying to develop new functionality my dang self." />

Don't forget it is probably their first question here and are quite nervous as to how they will be perceived (as one generally is when approaching a new group of people and having to ask something).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/La323.png &quot;Working at SE&quot;" />

I think those sorts of questions get people to want to answer, for whatever reason (pride/emotion in demonstrating their own first printer, good/bad experiences, what have you...). Maybe, instead of closing *all* of them, it is worth having just one example (locked/wiki) question, such as the example below, so that it *has already* been asked - then we can legitimately close subsequent similar duplicates, without any loss of information or help.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Taking this one as an example, https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/5836/whats-the-least-amount-of-money-i-can-spend-to-get-a-decent-printer. It was closed as being too broad. I actually voted to close it as well, although I'm starting to wish that I hadn't. It has some great answers in it and it is a shame that they have been lost.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since having been closed, it has now been *automatically deleted*. I'm just wondering whether it is worth undeleting it..?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am not 100% sure whether, after undeleting it, then leaving it closed will cause it to be automatically deleted again - isn't there some sort of *closed-but-don't-delete* flag? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If there isn't then would it also have to be re-opened? Which, of course, entails other issues of &quot;Why do we allow certain broad questions to be left open?&quot; or &quot;It's a shopping question!&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regardless, it *does* seem a shame to have lost those fine (but subjective) answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/search?q=closed%3Ayes" />

It is merely an attempt to offer one perspective of what has been suggested, and to ask &quot;How should we move forward?&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;[ask][2]&quot; and &quot;[topic][3]&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*.

Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][9]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Admittedly, there will be overlap with some other SE sites and whilst we need to avoid the *too-broad-black-hole*, we should also welcome all things that are 3D Printer related, so as to keep all relevant knowledge in a central location.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question... So (at the risk of duplication), if a new question/suggestion is posted, then it could be a good idea to also copy that new post and add it as an answer below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Meta Suggestions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are the meta questions that I used to create the categories above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## [ask](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=ask) - 89 questions *in total*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###General scope questions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;

I think those sorts of questions get people to want to answer, for whatever reason (pride/emotion in demonstrating their own first printer, good/bad experiences, what have you...). Maybe, instead of closing *all* of them, it is worth having just one example question, such as the example below, so that it *has already* been asked - then we can legitimately close subsequent similar duplicates, without any loss of information or help.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Taking this one as an example, https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/5836/whats-the-least-amount-of-money-i-can-spend-to-get-a-decent-printer. It was closed as being too broad. I actually voted to close it as well, although I'm starting to wish that I hadn't. It has some great answers in it and it is a shame that they have been lost.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since having been closed, it has now been *automatically deleted*. I'm just wondering whether it is worth undeleting it..?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am not 100% sure whether, after undeleting it, then leaving it closed will cause it to be automatically deleted again - isn't there some sort of *closed-but-don't-delete* flag? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If there isn't then would it also have to be re-opened? Which, of course, entails other issues of &quot;Why do we allow certain broad questions to be left open?&quot; or &quot;It's a shopping question!&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regardless, it *does* seem a shame to have lost those fine (but subjective) answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Summing up&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, the point of this post is, should we save this information somewhere, and if so, in what format?

It is merely an attempt to offer one perspective of what has been suggested, and to ask &quot;How should we move forward?&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;[ask][2]&quot; and &quot;[topic][3]&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*. Please feel free to either suggest a change, or edit this post directly and add any that have gone astray (in that respect, maybe this question should be a wiki?).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whilst we maybe don't want to change the aim of the site too much (as doing so may put off some regular users), maybe the scope needs to broaden slightly, as to have a wider appeal and be more *inclusive*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any thoughts, questions, additional suggestions that have not already been posted, agreements, or disagreements?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###TL;DR - Suggested topics&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the list below, &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Italics are used for notes&#xD;&#xA; - Strikethrough is used for definitive no-go topics&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whilst there may be *some* overlap, duplication and/or mis-categorisation, the list of suggested on-topics seems to be, essentially:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Recommendations (Hardware and Software)&#xD;&#xA;   - *Note: Usually banned from SE - with the exception of [Hardware Recommendations][4]*&#xD;&#xA;   - &lt;strike&gt;General Shopping  - *opinion based*&lt;/strike&gt;&#xD;&#xA;   - &lt;strike&gt;First printer - *opinion based*&lt;/strike&gt;, *see https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/278/best-first-printer-closed-wiki*&#xD;&#xA;   - Best printer&#xD;&#xA;     - &lt;strike&gt;Overall - *opinion based*&lt;/strike&gt;&#xD;&#xA;     - For specific task  - *opinion based but allowable?*&#xD;&#xA;   - Best software&#xD;&#xA;     - &lt;strike&gt;Overall - *opinion based*&lt;/strike&gt;&#xD;&#xA;     - For a specific task  - *opinion based but allowable?*&#xD;&#xA; - Software issues&#xD;&#xA;   - Firmware&#xD;&#xA;   - Tools &#xD;&#xA;   - 3D modelling (*same as **CAD**?*)&#xD;&#xA; - Websites (*could come under **Software** and/or **Tools***)&#xD;&#xA;   - Recommended sites&#xD;&#xA;     - for knowledge&#xD;&#xA;     - for models&#xD;&#xA;     - for online tools&#xD;&#xA;   - Issues with web based tools&#xD;&#xA; - CAD&#xD;&#xA;   - *Overlap with SE.Blender?*&#xD;&#xA; - Printer DIY&#xD;&#xA;   - Repair and maintenance (*both commercial and DIY repair of both commercial and DIY printers*)&#xD;&#xA;   - Construction&#xD;&#xA; - Components (*could come under **Printer DIY***)&#xD;&#xA;   - *[Thermistors][5] is a good example, see note &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; below*&#xD;&#xA; - Print Services&#xD;&#xA; - Scanning&#xD;&#xA;   - Also 3D Reconstruction ([example][6])&#xD;&#xA; - Bio-printing&#xD;&#xA; - Models&#xD;&#xA;   - Feasibility&#xD;&#xA;   - Availability&#xD;&#xA; - Sharing recommended settings&#xD;&#xA; - Legal issues&#xD;&#xA;   - Copyright (i.e. [Lego][7])&#xD;&#xA;   - Guns/Weapons&#xD;&#xA;   - Insurance (i.e. fire damage)&#xD;&#xA; - Filament&#xD;&#xA; - Makerspaces&#xD;&#xA; - Non-3D Printing related&#xD;&#xA;   - CNC&#xD;&#xA;   - Laser&#xD;&#xA;   - Routers&#xD;&#xA;   - Vacuum Forming&#xD;&#xA;   - Parts assembly ([example][8])&#xD;&#xA; - Misc&#xD;&#xA;   - Not strictly 3D related, see **Non-3D Printing related** above&#xD;&#xA;   - Anything 3D related&#xD;&#xA;     - *For example, [connecting 3D printed parts][9] is currently off-topic*&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;     - https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/3109/how-to-build-own-cura-gui - *Coding CURA question, migrated to SO*&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;   - Other&#xD;&#xA;     - FFF&#xD;&#xA;     - FDM&#xD;&#xA;     - SLA&#xD;&#xA;     - DLP&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Notes**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Admittedly, there will be overlap with some other SE sites and whilst we need to avoid the *too-broad-black-hole*, we should also welcome all things that are 3D Printer related, so as to keep all relevant knowledge in a central location.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; WRT **Components**, and taking the [thermistors meta question][10] as an example, my first thought is that questions like this should remain, as they are pertinent to 3D Printing, otherwise we *could* theoretically end up compartmentalising printers and migrating off a lot of stuff to SE. Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][9]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Also under **Misc/Anything 3D related**, Coding CURA *is* a SO type question, but it is *also* 3D printer specific&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question... So (at the risk of duplication), if a new question/suggestion is posted, then it could be a good idea to also copy that new post and add it as an answer below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Meta Suggestions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are the meta questions that I used to create the categories above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## [ask](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=ask) - 89 questions *in total*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###General scope questions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;

I think those sorts of questions get people to want to answer, for whatever reason (pride/emotion in demonstrating their own first printer, good/bad experiences, what have you...). Maybe, instead of closing *all* of them, it is worth having just one example question, such as the example below, so that it *has already* been asked - then we can legitimately close subsequent similar duplicates, without any loss of information or help.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Taking this one as an example, https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/5836/whats-the-least-amount-of-money-i-can-spend-to-get-a-decent-printer. It was closed as being too broad. I actually voted to close it as well, although I'm starting to wish that I hadn't.

What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;[ask][2]&quot; and &quot;[topic][3]&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request.

Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][9]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Also under **Misc/Anything 3D related**, Coding CURA *is* a SO type question, but it is *also* 3D printer specific&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together.

It is merely an attempt to offer one perspective of what has been suggested, and to ask &quot;How should we move forward?&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;[ask][2]&quot; and &quot;[topic][3]&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*.

Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][10]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Also under **Misc/Anything 3D related**, Coding CURA *is* a SO type question, but it is *also* 3D printer specific&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question...

It is usually only very poorly worded, poorly formatted and overly broad questions, where little thought and research has been done beforehand, which are shot down in flames... :-) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking at your Reddit post, it seems ok, but it could be worth relevant quoting parts from those links that you listed (as links die over time and the information that you refer to could be lost), and show why or why not, *you* think certain options may or may not be suitable. Your question could also appear to be opinion-based or broad - so it could be better to narrow down your question to a point or two (or three).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If it **does** end up getting closed, which hopefully it won't as you do appear to have put some thought into it, you will be provided with guidance as to how to edit and improve it and make it more suitable for StackExchange.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I wouldn't worry too much, even the best of us have *bad post days* sometimes... it's not a big deal :-)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, think about it this way, the time that you take formulating and crafting your question will be well spent as it should help clarify your question in your own mind.

If you want people to show up and do things, you (and everyone else) needs to vote. Up, down, sideways ... doesn't matter. They all help drive people to *do things* in every Stack.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking at the above link, you can see one of the things which is important to graduation is having the right user base. You have to have people who have the ability to do things which only those who have met the point level can do. As it stands the highest ranked person by point total is [Tom van der Zanden](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users/26/tom-van-der-zanden). He hasn't (as of this writing) broached 10k points. There are two users who have more than 5k points, and another five who are over 2500. How do you improve this scenario? You guessed it, by voting. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I realize with sub two questions per day (QPD), there's not a lot to vote on. That can be overcome as well. Those of you who have had issues or have met challenges have knowledge. Write down those challenges you've faced in a question. Then, either write an answer for them, or let someone else figure them out. Either way, you are creating opportunity for the site to expand. That opportunity will be giving someone a chance to vote and/or answer the question. Plus, you are doing what SE wants done in the first place: *bringing and recording knowledge*. It's a win-win.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's a ton of other things which can be done to get 3D Printing graduated. I'm sure we'll get there sooner or later. I hope I can help in some small way. I'm not the bastion of all knowledge to get a site graduated, that's for sure, but having gone through it with Mechanics gives me some insight.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's to the future and what it will bring." />

It is merely an attempt to offer one perspective of what has been suggested, and to ask &quot;How should we move forward?&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;[ask][2]&quot; and &quot;[topic][3]&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request.

Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][10]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Also under **Misc/Anything 3D related**, Coding CURA *is* a SO type question, but it is *also* 3D printer specific&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question... So (at the risk of duplication), if a new question/suggestion is posted, then it could be a good idea to also copy that new post and add it as an answer below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Meta Suggestions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are the meta questions that I used to create the categories above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## [ask](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=ask) - 89 questions *in total*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###General scope questions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;

It is merely an attempt to offer one perspective of what has been suggested, and to ask &quot;How should we move forward?&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;[ask][2]&quot; and &quot;[topic][3]&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request.

Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][10]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Also under **Misc/Anything 3D related**, Coding CURA *is* a SO type question, but it is *also* 3D printer specific&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question... So (at the risk of duplication), if a new question/suggestion is posted, then it could be a good idea to also copy that new post and add it as an answer below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Meta Suggestions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are the meta questions that I used to create the categories above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## [ask](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=ask) - 89 questions *in total*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###General scope questions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;

The opinion based, the open ended and and the *list of questions in one question*. Of these, the third is usually curable. And we had the topic of purchasind [earlier][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But now I want to put attention on a different horse in the room. Purchasing questions. These come actually in quite some different styles!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. &quot;I want to buy X. Where to get it?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;2. &quot;I need a model to do X but for [insert reason here] can't make it myself. Is there a model of it?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;3. &quot;I wonder about X. Has anyone encoutered X and can review it, so I can make an informed purchase?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All these question cores can be called purchasing, but they are also different to some degree. Let's start from the least to the most concearning one:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Question 2 is more a &quot;LMGTFY&quot;. There is a clear best answer, as there might be a model around or someone might make the model for the person asking. Or convert an unprinted model into a printable one. It is somewhat OffTopic for being 3D-design in some instances, but it is OnTopic as we want a 3D printable rendition. So, no problems with these? A little: they often show little to no research effort.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Question 3 is a different kind of horse. Actually it looks more like a Mule than a horse. Well, that is, because it is actually an ass&lt;sup&gt;donkey&lt;/sup&gt;. It is not a purchasing question in so much as it is a review request. We had some review guidelines proposed when we last talked about purchasing questions, and they were a solid step, but we might - if this is still OnTopic after this discussion, make a seperate meta for those. I deem the possibility of Reviews with a strict guideline OnTopic, as long as &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. all affiliations are made clear [e.g. is it a bought machine, review/send back machine or review/keep machine? Who's the sponsor? Just a watcher of this and that channel that reviewed the machine?] &#xD;&#xA; 2. They pass a Quality Control (however that may look like - guidelines are still to be made)&#xD;&#xA; 3. **They are not link-only answers.** One might put the full review in a video or link to several reviewers, but one should at least compile the pro/con of the video.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Question 1 is the big horse I have trouble seeing OnTopic here: they want a specific answer where to buy/get an object. Suggesting that one specific source might be better than any other would be inappropriate. But we might need to split the hair a little: There are *some* fringe cases where such a question is answerable, has a best answer and is not open ended when it comes to locating shops or makerspaces, that use the very same question setup (&quot;Is there a makerspace near X/Y/Z?&quot;) And there are questions that are what the RPG-StacK-Exchange calls &quot;Shopping &amp; Recommendation&quot;. They forbid to ask for a recommendation of a specific shop or item over another. We should adhere to that, unless it is one of these &quot;locate a real world place that does X&quot; cases. Imho we shouldn't  answer to a question like &quot;What is a good first printer?&quot; or &quot;Is there a reputable CR-10 reseller?&quot; or others of these kind. Maybe the gringe case of &quot;Can I buy Printer X at the manufacturer?&quot; is ok too, but that is more a sourcing problem, not a purchasing question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, in fleshing out our community:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Where do we draw our lines what is In/Out regarding purchasing/acquisition questions? And, do we need to discuss review/sourcing questions?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/179/another-approach-to-solving-purchase-questions" />

While I tried to add the appropriate names for these kit-printers, I feel that it technically is inappropriate for these to actually *have* this tag. Even as the DIY tag contains the &quot;assembled from a kit by the end user&quot; in the wiki, there is also non-commercially in it, meaning it seems to be meant for a true DIY kits like [Hypercube][1] or such. They are so vastly different, that I fel we should encourage the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* pull any comercial kits out of the [tag:DIY-3d-printer] tag&#xD;&#xA;* add a tag [tag:Printer-kit-assembly] or use [tag:printer-building] for questions that struggle with the assembly of a kit together with the specific model's tag&#xD;&#xA;* enforce the specific tag of the kit for questions having problems with it&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2254103" />

It is merely an attempt to offer one perspective of what has been suggested, and to ask &quot;How should we move forward?&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;[ask][2]&quot; and &quot;[topic][3]&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*. Please feel free to either suggest a change, or edit this post directly and add any that have gone astray (in that respect, maybe this question should be a wiki?).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whilst we maybe don't want to change the aim of the site too much (as doing so may put off some regular users), maybe the scope needs to broaden slightly, as to have a wider appeal and be more *inclusive*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any thoughts, questions, additional suggestions that have not already been posted, agreements, or disagreements?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###TL;DR - Suggested topics&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the list below, &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Italics are used for notes&#xD;&#xA; - Strikethrough is used for definitive no-go topics&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whilst there may be *some* overlap, duplication and/or mis-categorisation, the list of suggested on-topics seems to be, essentially:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Recommendations (Hardware and Software)&#xD;&#xA;   - *Note: Usually banned from SE - with the exception of [Hardware Recommendations][4]*&#xD;&#xA;   - &lt;strike&gt;General Shopping  - *opinion based*&lt;/strike&gt;&#xD;&#xA;   - &lt;strike&gt;First printer - *opinion based*&lt;/strike&gt;, *see https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/278/best-first-printer-closed-wiki*&#xD;&#xA;   - Best printer&#xD;&#xA;     - &lt;strike&gt;Overall - *opinion based*&lt;/strike&gt;&#xD;&#xA;     - For specific task  - *opinion based but allowable?*&#xD;&#xA;   - Best software&#xD;&#xA;     - &lt;strike&gt;Overall - *opinion based*&lt;/strike&gt;&#xD;&#xA;     - For a specific task  - *opinion based but allowable?*&#xD;&#xA; - Software issues&#xD;&#xA;   - Firmware&#xD;&#xA;   - Tools &#xD;&#xA;   - Coding/Compiling firmware (see **Misc - Coding**)&#xD;&#xA;   - 3D modelling (*same as **CAD**?*)&#xD;&#xA; - Websites (*could come under **Software** and/or **Tools***)&#xD;&#xA;   - Recommended sites&#xD;&#xA;     - for knowledge&#xD;&#xA;     - for models&#xD;&#xA;     - for online tools&#xD;&#xA;   - Issues with web based tools&#xD;&#xA; - CAD&#xD;&#xA;   - *Overlap with SE.Blender?*&#xD;&#xA; - Printer DIY&#xD;&#xA;   - Repair and maintenance (*both commercial and DIY repair of both commercial and DIY printers*)&#xD;&#xA;   - Construction&#xD;&#xA;   - Mechatronics&#xD;&#xA; - Components (*could come under **Printer DIY***)&#xD;&#xA;   - *[Thermistors][5] is a good example, see note &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; below*&#xD;&#xA; - Print Services&#xD;&#xA; - Scanning&#xD;&#xA;   - Also 3D Reconstruction ([example][6])&#xD;&#xA; - Bio-printing&#xD;&#xA; - Models&#xD;&#xA;   - Feasibility&#xD;&#xA;   - Availability&#xD;&#xA; - Sharing recommended settings&#xD;&#xA; - Legal issues&#xD;&#xA;   - Copyright (i.e. [Lego][7])&#xD;&#xA;   - Guns/Weapons&#xD;&#xA;   - Insurance (i.e. fire damage)&#xD;&#xA; - Materials&#xD;&#xA;   - Filament&#xD;&#xA;   - ABS&#xD;&#xA;   - PLA&#xD;&#xA;   - PETG&#xD;&#xA;   - etc.&#xD;&#xA; - Makerspaces&#xD;&#xA; - Non-3D Printing related&#xD;&#xA;   - CNC&#xD;&#xA;   - Laser ([example][8])&#xD;&#xA;   - Routers&#xD;&#xA;   - Vacuum Forming&#xD;&#xA;   - Parts assembly ([example][9])&#xD;&#xA; - Misc&#xD;&#xA;   - Not strictly 3D related, see **Non-3D Printing related** above&#xD;&#xA;   - Anything 3D related&#xD;&#xA;     - Connecting 3D printed parts - *For example, [connecting 3D printed parts][10] is currently off-topic*&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;     - Coding - *For example https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/3109/how-to-build-own-cura-gui - Coding CURA question, migrated to SO*&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;   - Other&#xD;&#xA;     - FFF (fused Filament Fabrication)&#xD;&#xA;     - FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling)&#xD;&#xA;     - SLA (Stereo Lithography)&#xD;&#xA;     - DLP (Digital Light Processing)&#xD;&#xA;     - SLS (Selective Laser Sintering)&#xD;&#xA;     - DLMS (Direct Laser Metal Smelting)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Notes**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Admittedly, there will be overlap with some other SE sites and whilst we need to avoid the *too-broad-black-hole*, we should also welcome all things that are 3D Printer related, so as to keep all relevant knowledge in a central location.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; WRT **Components**, and taking the [thermistors meta question][11] as an example, my first thought is that questions like this should remain, as they are pertinent to 3D Printing, otherwise we *could* theoretically end up compartmentalising printers and migrating off a lot of stuff to SE. Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][10]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Also under **Misc/Anything 3D related**, Coding CURA *is* a SO type question, but it is *also* 3D printer specific&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question... So (at the risk of duplication), if a new question/suggestion is posted, then it could be a good idea to also copy that new post and add it as an answer below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Meta Suggestions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are the meta questions that I used to create the categories above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## [ask](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=ask) - 89 questions *in total*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###General scope questions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;

It is merely an attempt to offer one perspective of what has been suggested, and to ask &quot;How should we move forward?&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;[ask][2]&quot; and &quot;[topic][3]&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*. Please feel free to either suggest a change, or edit this post directly and add any that have gone astray (in that respect, maybe this question should be a wiki?).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whilst we maybe don't want to change the aim of the site too much (as doing so may put off some regular users), maybe the scope needs to broaden slightly, as to have a wider appeal and be more *inclusive*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any thoughts, questions, additional suggestions that have not already been posted, agreements, or disagreements?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###TL;DR - Suggested topics&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the list below, &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Italics are used for notes&#xD;&#xA; - Strikethrough is used for definitive no-go topics&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whilst there may be *some* overlap, duplication and/or mis-categorisation, the list of suggested on-topics seems to be, essentially:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Recommendations (Hardware and Software)&#xD;&#xA;   - *Note: Usually banned from SE - with the exception of [Hardware Recommendations][4]*&#xD;&#xA;   - &lt;strike&gt;General Shopping  - *opinion based*&lt;/strike&gt;&#xD;&#xA;   - &lt;strike&gt;First printer - *opinion based*&lt;/strike&gt;, *see https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/278/best-first-printer-closed-wiki*&#xD;&#xA;   - Best printer&#xD;&#xA;     - &lt;strike&gt;Overall - *opinion based*&lt;/strike&gt;&#xD;&#xA;     - For specific task  - *opinion based but allowable?*&#xD;&#xA;   - Best software&#xD;&#xA;     - &lt;strike&gt;Overall - *opinion based*&lt;/strike&gt;&#xD;&#xA;     - For a specific task  - *opinion based but allowable?*&#xD;&#xA; - Software issues&#xD;&#xA;   - Firmware&#xD;&#xA;   - Tools &#xD;&#xA;   - Coding/Compiling firmware (see **Misc - Coding**)&#xD;&#xA;   - 3D modelling (*same as **CAD**?*)&#xD;&#xA; - Websites (*could come under **Software** and/or **Tools***)&#xD;&#xA;   - Recommended sites&#xD;&#xA;     - for knowledge&#xD;&#xA;     - for models&#xD;&#xA;     - for online tools&#xD;&#xA;   - Issues with web based tools&#xD;&#xA; - CAD&#xD;&#xA;   - *Overlap with SE.Blender?*&#xD;&#xA; - Printer DIY&#xD;&#xA;   - Repair and maintenance (*both commercial and DIY repair of both commercial and DIY printers*)&#xD;&#xA;   - Construction&#xD;&#xA;   - Mechatronics&#xD;&#xA; - Components (*could come under **Printer DIY***)&#xD;&#xA;   - *[Thermistors][5] is a good example, see note &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; below*&#xD;&#xA; - Print Services&#xD;&#xA; - Scanning&#xD;&#xA;   - Also 3D Reconstruction ([example][6])&#xD;&#xA; - Bio-printing&#xD;&#xA; - Models&#xD;&#xA;   - Feasibility&#xD;&#xA;   - Availability&#xD;&#xA; - Sharing recommended settings&#xD;&#xA; - Legal issues&#xD;&#xA;   - Copyright (i.e. [Lego][7])&#xD;&#xA;   - Guns/Weapons&#xD;&#xA;   - Insurance (i.e. fire damage)&#xD;&#xA; - Materials&#xD;&#xA;   - Filament&#xD;&#xA;   - ABS&#xD;&#xA;   - PLA&#xD;&#xA;   - PETG&#xD;&#xA;   - etc.&#xD;&#xA; - Makerspaces&#xD;&#xA; - Non-3D Printing related&#xD;&#xA;   - CNC&#xD;&#xA;   - Laser ([example][8])&#xD;&#xA;   - Routers&#xD;&#xA;   - Vacuum Forming&#xD;&#xA;   - Parts assembly ([example][9])&#xD;&#xA; - Misc&#xD;&#xA;   - Not strictly 3D related, see **Non-3D Printing related** above&#xD;&#xA;   - Anything 3D related&#xD;&#xA;     - Connecting 3D printed parts - *For example, [connecting 3D printed parts][10] is currently off-topic*&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;     - Coding - *For example https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/3109/how-to-build-own-cura-gui - Coding CURA question, migrated to SO*&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;   - Other&#xD;&#xA;     - FFF (fused Filament Fabrication)&#xD;&#xA;     - FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling)&#xD;&#xA;     - SLA (Stereo Lithography)&#xD;&#xA;     - DLP (Digital Light Processing)&#xD;&#xA;     - SLS (Selective Laser Sintering)&#xD;&#xA;     - DLMS (Direct Laser Metal Smelting)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Notes**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Admittedly, there will be overlap with some other SE sites and whilst we need to avoid the *too-broad-black-hole*, we should also welcome all things that are 3D Printer related, so as to keep all relevant knowledge in a central location.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; WRT **Components**, and taking the [thermistors meta question][11] as an example, my first thought is that questions like this should remain, as they are pertinent to 3D Printing, otherwise we *could* theoretically end up compartmentalising printers and migrating off a lot of stuff to SE. Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][10]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Also under **Misc/Anything 3D related**, Coding CURA *is* a SO type question, but it is *also* 3D printer specific&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question... So (at the risk of duplication), if a new question/suggestion is posted, then it could be a good idea to also copy that new post and add it as an answer below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Meta Suggestions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are the meta questions that I used to create the categories above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## [ask](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=ask) - 89 questions *in total*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###General scope questions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;

It is merely an attempt to offer one perspective of what has been suggested, and to ask &quot;How should we move forward?&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;[ask][2]&quot; and &quot;[topic][3]&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*.

WRT **Components**, and taking the [thermistors meta question][11] as an example, my first thought is that questions like this should remain, as they are pertinent to 3D Printing, otherwise we *could* theoretically end up compartmentalising printers and migrating off a lot of stuff to SE. Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][10]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Also under **Misc/Anything 3D related**, Coding CURA *is* a SO type question, but it is *also* 3D printer specific&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question... So (at the risk of duplication), if a new question/suggestion is posted, then it could be a good idea to also copy that new post and add it as an answer below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Meta Suggestions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are the meta questions that I used to create the categories above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## [ask](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=ask) - 89 questions *in total*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###General scope questions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;

It is merely an attempt to offer one perspective of what has been suggested, and to ask &quot;How should we move forward?&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;[ask][2]&quot; and &quot;[topic][3]&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*. Please feel free to either suggest a change, or edit this post directly and add any that have gone astray (in that respect, maybe this question should be a wiki?).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whilst we maybe don't want to change the aim of the site too much (as doing so may put off some regular users), maybe the scope needs to broaden slightly, as to have a wider appeal and be more *inclusive*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any thoughts, questions, additional suggestions that have not already been posted, agreements, or disagreements?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###TL;DR - Suggested topics&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the list below, &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Italics are used for notes&#xD;&#xA; - Strikethrough is used for definitive no-go topics&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whilst there may be *some* overlap, duplication and/or mis-categorisation, the list of suggested on-topics seems to be, essentially:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Recommendations (Hardware and Software)&#xD;&#xA;   - *Note: Usually banned from SE - with the exception of [Hardware Recommendations][4]*&#xD;&#xA;   - &lt;strike&gt;General Shopping  - *opinion based*&lt;/strike&gt;&#xD;&#xA;

    - SLS (Selective Laser Sintering)&#xD;&#xA;     - DLMS (Direct Laser Metal Smelting)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Notes**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Admittedly, there will be overlap with some other SE sites and whilst we need to avoid the *too-broad-black-hole*, we should also welcome all things that are 3D Printer related, so as to keep all relevant knowledge in a central location.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; WRT **Components**, and taking the [thermistors meta question][11] as an example, my first thought is that questions like this should remain, as they are pertinent to 3D Printing, otherwise we *could* theoretically end up compartmentalising printers and migrating off a lot of stuff to SE. Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][10]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Also under **Misc/Anything 3D related**, Coding CURA *is* a SO type question, but it is *also* 3D printer specific&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question... So (at the risk of duplication), if a new question/suggestion is posted, then it could be a good idea to also copy that new post and add it as an answer below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Meta Suggestions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are the meta questions that I used to create the categories above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## [ask](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=ask) - 89 questions *in total*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###General scope questions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;

If you talk to the same person regardless of which part is defective out of the box, it's not DIY.  So, from Greenonline's examples, 1, 2, and 3 are DIY, while 4 and 5 aren't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yes, that means that a printer can evolve from &quot;not DIY&quot; to &quot;DIY&quot;.  For example, if you start with a preassembled Prusa i3 Mk3, but then replace the V6 hotend with a Volcano hotend in an extruder found on Thingiverse, switch to a 320-watt Meanwell PSU, replace the display with a touchscreen, change out the ball bearings for sleeve bearings, upgrade the steppers for more precision, and install a BuildTak bed, you've now got a DIY printer." />

If you've been on any of the `.moderated` newsgroups you'll be well aware that to get a post on there, it needs to undergo a review process first and be accepted. The aim is to keep problem discussions from arising.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;SE is slightly different - it works the other  way. *Anyone* can ask a question on SE and closing a question is the equivalent of putting that question *back into review/improve mode*. It's a feedback mechanism designed to react to problem cases only, so the usual business of asking and answering good questions can just... *happen*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we close a question?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The philosophy of SE is that each site handles questions on *problems you face* or things you are trying to understand. The [don't ask](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask) section of the help center gives you a good overview of things that don't work - to summarise:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Some questions invite arguments or extended debate that suck up time when members could be helping other people.&#xD;&#xA;* Some questions are too broad, too narrow or have other content problems.&#xD;&#xA;* Some questions belong elsewhere.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These have been worked out over time and with a lot of experience from Stack Overflow and are, *broadly speaking* true. Sometimes, exceptions are made - it is always a case-by-case thing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Is closing like deletion?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No. Actually, deletion is a different concept on SE. Closed questions are put &quot;into improve mode&quot; if you like, and are still visible for *anyone* to improve. That's the idea. Deleted questions are different — they have a red background and are invisible to all but high reputation users. So deletion is different and solves a slightly different problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### What are the requirements for closing a question?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have 3000 reputation, or 500 reputation on a beta site, you can vote to close any question for the reasons above. More on that in a moment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you do not have this level of reputation, you will find that under the flag menu, you have an option &quot;this question does not belong here&quot;. That will raise a flag for users who can vote to close.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why can anyone vote to close/reopen?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Firstly, anyone with sufficient reputation can vote to close or reopen (or flag as such, with lower reputation) because it is *your site*. This is really important - it's about expressing what you feel works and doesn't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Ok, so how does it work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Example close button][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ok, the important piece. Voting to close works like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * Underneath the question, there will be a close link. When you click on this, you will be presented with a list of options from which you can pick a close reason most appropriate to the situation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Close vote reasons dialog][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * If other people have voted, you will see blue numbers against the reason they chose.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Other votes][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * The exact duplicate page takes you to a page that allows you to specify a question to close as an exact duplicate against.&#xD;&#xA; * The &quot;off topic&quot; page will present you with two options - one to migrate here, to meta, and one just off topic. At the moment, only moderators can send questions elsewhere, so feel free to cast a vote here and flag if you have a target in mind - we are collecting statistics to build a &quot;migrate to&quot; list, but that is not implemented yet.&#xD;&#xA; * The other options are straight out closes.&#xD;&#xA; * Once you pick your option and click &quot;close&quot;, your vote is registered. You cannot retract it at this stage, but nobody else, including moderators, will know it was you who voted.&#xD;&#xA; * If five people agree, the question will be closed. You've seen the effect of these before.&#xD;&#xA; * Your name, and the name of other closers, will appear on the bottom of the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Close banner][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### How does vote to re-open work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A closed question has a &quot;reopen&quot; link underneath it. If you click this, a dialog box will ask you if you are sure - click yes and your vote will be registered to re-open the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Below, you can see an example of the re-open link with two votes registered for re-opening (out of five).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Re-open link][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### What happens if I make a mistake?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't worry! You can retract your close vote by clicking the “close” button again. This is useful, for example, if the question has been edited since you voted to close. Note that you cannot use this to change the close reason (if you retract a close vote, you can't cast a new one).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore, unless five people agree, or a moderator agrees, the question won't be closed. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why are some questions closed with fewer votes?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moderator close votes complete the required vote count immediately, no matter how many people have voted. This applies for both close/reopen votes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore, closure as duplicate can be faster for two reasons. If the asker agrees that their question is a duplicate, they can validate the closure immediately. This shows a final duplicate close vote from “Community”. Also, if a user with a gold tag badge in one of the question's initial tags votes to close or reopen as a duplicate, this takes effect immediately; in this case a gold tag badge icon appears after the closer's name.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### I've seen a closed question and I disagree. What can I do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Well, one option is to use your re-open vote! You can also always raise a discussion here on meta to seek clarification on why a question is closed and hopefully either a resolution will be reached, or you will get an explanation for the closure. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### My name appears on the bottom. Isn't this going to cause problems with other users?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Actually, surprisingly few closed questions generate any response at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, if you experience difficulties as a result of closing a question, you can and should contact a moderator via the flag mechanism (which is anonymous). We can then take any necessary action.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### How do I find questions I might need to close? What about re-opens?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the [review queues](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/review), specifically the [close votes queue](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/review/close) and the [reopen votes queue](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/review/reopen). These queues are open to everyone who has the close vote privilege. For each question, you get to decide whether to close/reopen or not; enough “no” votes take the question out of the queue. An edit from the queue is a vote to not close or reopen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/qogGL.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/THms0.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/69Kak.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/K3F4V.png&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/syw4O.png" />

This script was made for Stack Exchange. The name of the add-on is: [AutoReviewComments](https://github.com/Benjol/SE-AutoReviewComments).

I've found since I've been sneaking around here on 3D Printing, it automagically sets the &quot;welcome&quot; note to the current site, as well as if there are custom comments you've added on another site won't show up here.

Without wishing to provide a link to the actual comment, I noticed a comment the other day that suggested as much, and a nicely detailed comment was left instead. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To be fair, I feel that way sometimes, and often hesitate (maybe rightly so to save myself from spamming the site) in posting questions on SE.Meta, as there are a number of drive-by downvoters there&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

This is probably rightly so, TBH, in most cases, but nevertheless it can be discouraging.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you don't have much hard-earned rep then you may be less willing to risk it by posting a informative answer, that only answers half the question.  Is that a bad thing? Well, it is a double edged sword. It is a good thing, because that promotes good solid answers, but with the downside that you point out (a lack of multiple answers per question).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What can we do? Probably, not much other than creating a small community by promoting a friendly environment and communicating more clearly... Inviting people to chat in the chatroom, being more welcoming (with Hi and welcome), actually helping people without the old &quot;Did you google this?&quot; immediately.  All of these things help a lot. And which we seem to have developed of late.

But: Type 1 questions, if properly narrowed, can easily become type 4 questions and, therefore, help in raising the answers-questions-ratio.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/6661/10684&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/6640/10684&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/6342/10684&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/4459/10684" />

I don't think this site lends to having a huge amount of ApQ's, because usually there is only going to really be one answer which will work. I think the ApQ category was based more towards the programming/tech sites. I mean, when programming, there's almost ALWAYS going to be more than one way to answer a question.Then when you look at other sites where there is advice given, like Travel.SE or Law.SE, you could possibly see a plethora of answers for each of their questions. Then you take WorldBuilding.SE and it's a whole new level.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;IIRC, when Mechanics.SE graduated, we had sub 2.0 ApQ. I don't think 3D's is out of line with that and it isn't going to hurt the site for graduation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While multi-ApQ is not a bad thing, it only works if the question deserves it. If the question isn't answered correctly or if there might be something else which could be the answer, then multi-ApQ is an awesome thing. To make answers for answer sake, just to boost the ApQ, that can be ugly. A much better idea is (IMHO), to upvote good Q/A's and downvote bad ones.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I completely agree with moving the site forward, but my suggestion is to move it forward in the right direction by putting energy where energy is needed. &#xD;&#xA;" />

In particular, among the engineers I hang with there is a desire for the generally-accepted-as-valid design principles -- the design rules that, when followed, will usually work.  I haven't come across a reference that lays out such rules for FDM printing, and so I launched a question which someone who knew of such a rule set could answer, or which I could later attempt to answer if a better answer didn't appear.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I asked [this question][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The question drew a &quot;have you googled that?&quot; response, coupled with a helpful link.

There is still a focus amongst some members on only answering specific 'problem' questions, rather than generating a comprehensive resource covering the whole subject.

I feel this was kind of implicit in the question, but some may have been mislead by the terminology.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Should tolerances be included? With an electronics background rather than engineering, `Design Rules` implies a final sign-off stage check of low level trivial detail rather than the entry point to the design flow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the question also suffers slightly from a _I have an answer in mind, so it seems that I'm asking the question in a way that leads to that answer_, kind of an X-Y of getting the answer posted (in this case, the answer is the true goal, not the question)." />
