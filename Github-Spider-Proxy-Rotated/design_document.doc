### Github-Spider-Proxy-Rotated
Github-Spider-Proxy-Rotated is an advanced version of the previous spider; it contains pipelines, middlewares,
and throttling parameters, which is in the middleware and settings file. This spider is for advanced scraping.
It has a bottleneck mechanism for limiting the number of HTTP requests per second, and also a technique for
HTTP headers rotation. It outputs the results in JSON format.
