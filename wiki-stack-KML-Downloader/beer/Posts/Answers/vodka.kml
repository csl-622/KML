					&lt;p&gt;Mixing vodka (alcohol mixed with water) to beer (alcohol mixed with water plus some flavouring and other compounds) is perfectly safe. No need to be a daredevil to do it. Beer cocktails also exist but have varying degrees of pleasantness. The "black velvet", stout and sparkling wine &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Velvet_(beer_cocktail)" rel="nofollow"&gt;(Black Velvet -
					beer cocktail)&lt;/a&gt; I have tried and can confirm that it is not too bad as beer cocktails go.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I make no assertions as to the quality of the hangover after beer cocktails.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is most definitely okay, but can lead to much higher alcohol content compared to what one might expect. There is actually a commonly made mix in college that I and others had made using a bottle of vodka a couple cans of beer and lemonade concentrate. Was quite good, but dangerous in high quantity. I know of others who would put an ounce or so of flavored vodka or rum in their beers as well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yip, all good. As a student we called it "Power [Drink]", where [Drink] is the name of the original drink. :p&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Anything that is safe to eat/drink can be added to a beer. Whether it will taste good is subjective. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer and lemonade (shandy) is well known. Beer and fruit juice (radler) is getting popular. There are LOADS of recipes on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;(Soviet)&lt;/em&gt; Russia it is called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorsh"&gt;Yorsch&lt;/a&gt; ("yorsh" means &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruffe"&gt;ruffe&lt;/a&gt;, a small fish remarkable for its hard and sharp spines). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is a variations of it – "From brown bear to the polar and back". You take a glass of beer, drink a little, fill it up with vodka, drink again, fill up again and keep drinking and filling until the mixture is colorless. After that you keep on drinking but start to fill it up with beer. It is said that many have seen The White Polar Bear but only few have managed to see The Brown again.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer cocktails, where spirits are added to beer, were a sort of Fad here in the US a couple years ago.  Maybe they still are (I'm sort of isolated where I live in that respect). Your question of safe is a bit perplexing.  The only unsafe part might be if you give a charged up beer to someone who isn't used to much alcohol and bad consequences result...  But otherwise it's not unsafe.  I've done it (added vodka to beer) and it doesn't taste that great to me.  But with some other additions you can make a pretty great cocktail.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Of course you can add vodka to beer! As long as you're mindful of how much you're drinking and how long it takes to process, you should be fine. The harder part is actually devising a cocktail you'd want to drink.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With the popularity of craft beer, a new culture of beer cocktails is growing. Do a quick Google search, and you'll come up with tons of great recipes, old and new. While the craft beer world has traditionally been sceptical about mixing things with beer, there are endless possibilities to elevate and excite, and some are coming around to this.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My old beer manager would make a Blanche De Chamblay and vanilla vodka drink that was delicious. Rauchbier and other smoked styles work amazingly well in a bloody Mary.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the mood strikes you, experiment!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your body takes a while to break down alcohol that is in your bloodstream. I believe it is 1 hour per 3%. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;During this period you will not rest, as your body is still hard at work.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hangovers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Primary causes are dehydration and toxins built up in your system from the impurities in the alcohol you've been drinking, but in my personal experience and research sugar content can also contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Dehydration&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Alcohol makes people urinate more, which raises the chances of dehydration occurring. Dehydration can give the individual that sensation of thirst and lightheadedness.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Impurites&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most alcoholic beverages contain small amounts of chemicals
					other than ethanol as a by-product of the materials used
					in the fermenting process (e.g., grains and wood casks). Congeners
					are complex organic molecules with toxic effects including
					acetone, acetaldehyde, fusel oil, tannins, and furfural. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Spirits have these in higher quantities than beer or wine due to the distillation process. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Sugar content&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Depending on what specific brands you are drinking and/or what you are mixing with high sugar content can cause you to have a sugar crash contributing to the hangover feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Quality&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In my personal experience the mornings after indulging with top shelf spirits are notably better than those done on a budget. Bargain spirits tend to be cut with grain alcohol and balanced with corn syrup contributing to the issue, but in general higher priced spirits tend to be more highly refined (Vodka for example tends to have more filtration the more expensive it is).  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;References&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of different factors that provide the alcohols percentage,&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;It's not really the liquid burning. It's the vapors that catch fire.
					  Higher proof equals more vapor, depending on temperature. &lt;a href="http://gizmodo.com/5935493/five-scientifically-surprising-facts-about-booze" rel="nofollow"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So burning alcohol is not a guaranteed way of finding out the percentage as whilst cooking wine will 'flame on' despite being low percentage and this is all to do with the vapor of the alcohol. Sure a High proof alcohol will catch fire easier but that will only tell you that it is a high proof alcohol not the percentage in it. A low proof vodka can ignite if a flame is held to it as the change in temperature will make it produce more vapor and it will ignite&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;(Please don't try and set fire to alcohol if you don't need to it can course spillage that will then cause an out of control fire and we don't want any of you guys to start burning up on us now )&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You don't define "burn" and I don't find a reference.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Is burn distill or literally burn.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Fire requires heat, oxygen, and fuel.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Flash point is the temp it will burn with an external ignition source. The flash point is a function of temp. Not much effected by humidity.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;The flash points of ethanol wt % concentrations[102]
					wt %    Temperature
					10%     49 °C (120 °F)
					20%     36 °C (97 °F)
					30%     29 °C (84 °F)
					40%     26 °C (79 °F)
					50%     24 °C (75 °F)
					60%     22 °C (72 °F)
					70%     21 °C (70 °F)
					80%     20 °C (68 °F)
					90%     17 °C (63 °F)
					96%     17 °C (63 °F)
					&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Even at the flash point it will not generate enough heat to continue burning once the external ignition source is removed.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Burn off would be hard to gauge and I don't think any alcohol (for human consumption) would burn 1/2 off at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Give 1/2 is the threshold it is more like they just boiled the alcohol off in a pot. The boiling point of alcohol is 173 F. Just stop when the temp get to 173F. 50% would be 100 proof. Yes some water boils off even at 173 and some alcohol is left behind. But it is about a wash.  I would say the margin of error would be like 5%. If you did a true batch distillation would be within 1%.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the UK, I never came across a "beer cocktail", certainly not one spiked with strong spirits (hard liquor in AmE) like vodka or tequila. I'm somewhat &lt;em&gt;surprised&lt;/em&gt; (British understatement) that the OP needs to do this to a good glass of beer in order to "make it a good party" [sic]. Doing this is just as likely to ruin the enjoyment of the vodka/tequila and vice-versa the beer. Such adulteration of these two mutually exclusive beverages is an abomination. Evidently the hoped for effect of spiking beer in this way is to encourage inebriation among the party goers. Not the sort of thing that makes a "good party" in my experience. Beer "cocktails" of a more benign kind in the UK also include a "shandy", traditional beer to which non-alcoholic fizzy lemonade is added. In the UK, another beer cocktail of sorts is the "Black &amp;amp; Tan", a fifty-fifty mixture of traditional beer or pale ale with dark porter or stout (typically Guinness)  I think the Scots got it right when they embraced the "beer-chaser", a pint of traditional beer ordered with a wee dram of Scotch (whiskey) on the side, served separately in a glass tot. A beer "cocktail" of this kind, drunk in tandem with each other, is so much more appealing than throwing hard liquor in with a good beer and vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Well I experiment quite a lot with different beers, either mixing up two or three different ones to see how well they taste together or mixing a beer with a spirit. Having worked in a number of different beer bars I am exposed to beers of all kinds more often than not. I'd say try using sour beers and experiment with the liquors that you have at home to see what you feel tastes best. Sweet beers might work as well. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A few fairly popular (and very different) beer cocktails are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Boilermaker or Depth Charge&lt;br&gt;
					The original English version was a mix of draught and brown, but it's more recently been popularised in Australia and the USA as a pint of beer with a shot of spirit (usually whisk[e]y) in it. If the shot is poured in, it's a Boilermaker. If the entire shot glass is dropped into the pint glass, it's a Depth Charge. Take care as this can make you very drunk more quickly than you expect (some may consider this a feature, but I'm trying to post responsible advice here).&lt;br&gt;
					Useful when: you want to make your beer (or your spirits) more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Black Velvet&lt;br&gt;
					Equal parts stout and champagne served inna champagne flute. The stout is floated on top for a striking visual effect.&lt;br&gt;
					Useful when: you want to add some class to your beering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Michelada&lt;br&gt;
					Lager spiced up with lime juice, salt and hot sauce. There are many variations, some including things like clam juice, tomato juice, worcestershire sauce or chilli flakes. It's kind of like a Bloody Mary in beer form.&lt;br&gt;
					Useful when: you want to treat a hangover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Shandy&lt;br&gt;
					Equal parts beer and a softer drink, usually lemonade.&lt;br&gt;
					Useful when: you don't really like beer or lemonade but there's not much else on offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not exactly beer, but a Spiked Apple Cider (like Redd's, Angry Orchard, or Bold Rock) mixed with a shot of Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey is delicious.  As an added bonus, neither of the ingredients are particularly potent, as such, most people can have 1 or 2 and not be completely hammered.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This drink is sometimes called Angry Balls, Apple Beer Bomb, Double Spiked Cider, Redd Balls, or a Dicken's Cider.  It works as a drop shot or a cocktail and unlike most other beer cocktails the ingredients create a proper flavor fusion.  While delicious year 'round. This cocktail has a distinct autumn appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In a drink that may appear offensive to some, Guinness(other stouts work too) mixes well with ice cream, for a beer milkshake or beer float.  Throw in Bailey's, Kahlua, and/or Vodka with the beer and vanilla ice cream to make an Irish Mudslide.  The combination of Guinness with ice cream creates a sort of malted flavor.  Without other liquors, a Guinness shake is not particularly strong and this suits itself well to a dessert drink.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finally, a fairly popular drink using non alcoholic ginger beer would be a Moscow Mule.  Vodka + non alcoholic Ginger Beer + lime juice.
					This works well with an Alcoholic Ginger Beer like Crabbie's, but be mindful that a glass of crabbies with a shot of vodka is roughly equivalent to drinking two glasses of beer.  Replacing Vodka with lower proofed alcohol like Lemoncello or even flavored vodkas(like Whipped Vodka - kinda like a cream soda with ginger beer) can allow for people to have multiples of these.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here are some beer cocktails:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Bulldog Mexicana&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Mexican Bulldog Margarita, simply put, is a margarita joined by a bottle of Corona--in the same glass. Specifically, that glass should be large enough to handle a margarita and a beer. To make this specialty, all that's needed is one ounce of your favorite tequila (if you add an extra splash, we won't tell). You'll also need lime margarita mix and any other margarita fixings you like such as salt around the rim and a juicy slice of lime. Mix up your margarita as you normally would. When it's complete, you will invert the bottle of Corona into the glass allowing the golden beer to combine with the cocktail. The result is quite extraordinary. Many people love the way the beer cuts down on some of the cocktail's sweetness. Others simply love the punch it packs. Because this drink is actually two drinks combined in one glass, you may want to take it easy on ordering a second or add some crushed ice to the glass!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep It Classic: The Black Velvet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Featuring one-part Guinness and one-part brut sparkling wine, the Black Velvet is a London-born beer cocktail that first wowed pub goers in 1861. The drink was actually created to help mourn the loss of Queen Victoria's consort, Prince Albert. Champagne is traditionally the sparkling wine of choice but others may be substituted. Serve this half and half beverage in a stout beer glass and you may then enjoy its Victorian charms.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep it Light: the Cuban Bul&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're not in the mood for the heavy Black Velvet, try the refreshing spritzer-like Cuban Bul. You'll need a 12-oz can of light beer (choose something crisp), a 12 oz can of ginger ale, two tablespoons of sugar (or to taste), and a third of a cup of lime juice (go for freshly squeezed). Mix the ingredients along with some crushed ice in a glass, taste, and discover your new favorite cocktail; it's a winner and you'll be amazed at how light and delicious it tastes!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zindeed.com/articles/beer-cocktails-why-choose-one-when-you-can-have-them-together" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Beer + Cocktails: Why Choose One When You Can Have Them Together!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2014/04/charcuterie-pairing-spirits-cocktails-advice-jeff-faile-partisan-dc.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;This link&lt;/a&gt; has decent information on pairing spirits. The problem for giving generalizations becomes differences in palate. Most people don't pair straight spirits with foods as most (self injected word) people reading websites for pairings drink spirits in "cocktail" format.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Information from the website includes:  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RYE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Faile recommends pouring rye to cut through the high fat content of fattier charcuterie options. "The tannins and natural spices come through in a rye," he explains, "and a higher proof (100 or higher) is perfect for complementing something fatty and smoked."&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOURBON&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;bourbon naturally complements smoky flavors, but the added dimension of sweetness can come in handy. "Bourbons pair with the same principle as spicy foods paired with Riesling," says Faile. "The sweetness of the bourbon tempers the heat from spice so the heat does not become the only note. A wheated bourbon coats the tongue to allow the spice to come through with each bite rather than building up." &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCOTCH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"The peatiness of Scotch makes it a perfect match for smoked meats, " says Anda. "German style sausages, like landjäger, are great with Scotch because they're smoked with immense depth of flavor and not overly fatty."&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;But finding the right charcuterie match can be a bit of a moving target depending on how the spirit is finished. A sherry-barrel aged Scotch like Bowmore 15, accents peat flavors with a sweetness that Faile says can be great with saltier charcuterie.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GIN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"Being all herbal and floral," Faile explains, "gin doesn't require fat to balance its flavors." Instead, the charcuterie flavors to look for when thinking of pairings for gin, says Faile, "are botanical more than fat." Herbs like fennel and thyme are key points for pairing. "Porchetta's are often seasoned with fennel and citrus," Anda says, pointing to one delicious option. Anda also recommends duck prosciutto, which he describes as more oily than fatty and is often cured with herbs, or a finocchiona, a fennel salami&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMARO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Along the same lines as gin, amaro's earthy, herbaceous, and citrus qualities give it pairing versatility. Faile recommends trying earthy Averna with a liverwurst, or herbaceous Fernet with a bresaola or speck. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/31347/smirnoff-red-bot1950s" rel="noreferrer"&gt;vintage bottles&lt;/a&gt; that will set you back that much, but they get their price tag from rarity, not quality. If you're just looking for fancy vodka, you reach diminishing returns pretty quickly. The &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/26/dining/a-humble-old-label-ices-its-rivals.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;New York Times noted Smirnoff as the best&lt;/a&gt; in a blind tasting, while Playboy's booze columnist had good things to say about &lt;a href="http://www.highsnobiety.com/2016/10/07/bottom-shelf-vodka-review-playboy/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Popov, which comes in a plastic bottle.&lt;/a&gt;. Even a vodka that is &lt;em&gt;supposedly&lt;/em&gt; easier on your liver (because you know.... science and stuff) only goes for &lt;a href="https://www.worldwidebev.com/bellion-vodka-80at-750ml.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;30 dollars&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;On the luxury end of the spectrum vodka tops out around 70 bucks. This includes a numbered, limited edition bottle, that uses potato vintages in the same way that wines use grape vintages, and even &lt;a href="http://www.drinkspirits.com/vodka/karlssons-batch-2009-vodka-review/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;lists the name of the potato farmer on the label&lt;/a&gt;. There are some notable and pricey exceptions to that. &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/lealane/2014/11/28/a-new-extravagant-gift-possibility-a-3k-bottle-of-stoli/#779c753a57db" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Stolichnaya released three limited edition bottlings&lt;/a&gt; a few years back, each going for 3k. The big deal with these was that they used special water sources. &lt;strong&gt;When you go for ultra-premium vodka, that's what you get.... really expensive water.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are still interested, &lt;a href="http://subzerovodkabar.com/vodkas/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Subzero&lt;/a&gt; in St. Louis was named one of the best vodka bars in America by both &lt;a href="http://experience.usatoday.com/food-and-wine/story/best-of-food-and-wine/spirits/2014/02/12/best-vodka-bars-in-america/5432095/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.liquor.com/articles/best-vodka-bars/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Liquor.com&lt;/a&gt;. They have one of, if not the single largest vodka collection of any bar in the US. As far as I know, three of their bottles are over a hundred dollars. The first is one of the Stoli bottles mentioned above. The second is called &lt;a href="https://www.diffordsguide.com/beer-wine-spirits/spirits/vodka-and-korn-and-poteen/BWS003711/harlen-d-wheatley-clix-vodka" rel="noreferrer"&gt;CLIX&lt;/a&gt;, and is made by Buffalo Trace distillery. The name comes from the roman numeral for the number of times it's distilled....159. Which is 157 times more than necessary, in my humble opinion. The other is &lt;a href="http://www.drinkhacker.com/2015/12/19/review-ciroc-x/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Ciroc Ten&lt;/a&gt;. Both of those come in around 300 greenbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally, whether this is a gift or you just want to try something different, here are a few things that might interest you. &lt;a href="https://spiritsreview.com/reviews/napa-valley-vodka/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Napa Reserve Neutral Brandy&lt;/a&gt; is vodka made from wine. It used to be called vodka and not brandy, pretty sure they had to change that for regulatory reasons. Grey &lt;a href="http://www.drinkhacker.com/2015/11/13/review-grey-goose-vx-vodka/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Goose VX&lt;/a&gt; is vodka mixed with a little bit of brandy. Finally Black Cow Milk Vodka. It was the first vodka made from milk and if I remember right, a couple years back I could swear I heard it was Prince Williams favored vodka. Then again, apparently a &lt;strong&gt;bottle of Smirnoff was seen at &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3554577/A-cherished-picture-Diana-boys-gifts-Obamas-12-bottle-Smirnoff-vodka-Never-seen-pictures-unique-glimpse-William-Kate-s-home-Kensington-Palace.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Kensington Palace&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/strong&gt; and if the cheap stuff is good enough for royalty, it should be good enough for anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It would help to know what the purpose of the purchase. gift? collection? own use?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In any case &lt;em&gt;Starka&lt;/em&gt;, especially the 25 year or 50 year, would probably go for that much.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starka" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"Starka is a traditional dry vodka distilled from rye grain, currently produced only in Poland and Lithuania. Traditionally Starka is made from natural (up to 2 distillations, no rectification) rye spirit and aged in oak barrels with small additions of linden-tree and apple-tree leaves. The methods of production are similar to those used in making whisky. Sold in various grades, the most notable difference between them is the length of the aging period, varying from 5 to over 50 years, and the natural color which is obtained from the reaction between the alcohol and the oak barrel, not from the additives."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And from my personal experience in Russia, it is very drinkable. You may have a hard time finding it, depending on your location. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is the Georgian Grappa: &lt;em&gt;Chacha&lt;/em&gt;, AKA grape vodka, see &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chacha_(brandy)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chacha_(brandy)&lt;/a&gt; This one is a bit strong for my taste, though, but a nice addition to a collection, or an unusual gift. Not sure about the price&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your main criterion, especially if you are serving sturgeon caviar, should be something to freshen the palate without leaving a strong aftertaste. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A brut champagne goes exceptionally well. If keeping the Russian theme is important and you have a good eastern European shop at hand, you could try to get a Russian or Ukrainian Шампанское. Be aware that many Russian and Ukrainian wines tend to be much sweeter than a western European would expect; make sure it is Брют / Brut, and ideally try a bottle before serving it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Caviar has a delicate flavor, and it shouldn’t compete with another ingredient, which could overwhelm it which would include either food or drink.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Being a non fan of either vodka or champagne, I would like to recommend a dry white wine, which by the way should always be chilled. I would be inclined to suggest a  Sauvignon Blanc as an example.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Sauvignon Blanc &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;This is one of the driest, crispest wines. This lean, clean wine is often herbaceous with well balanced acidity and underlying fruits. You can find Sauvignon Blanc grown around the world. Major growing regions include Bordeaux, New Zealand, the Loire Valley, South Africa, Austria, California, and Washington State. &lt;a href="http://wine.lovetoknow.com/wiki/Types_of_Dry_White_Wine" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Types of Dry White Wine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are some traditional drinks that are generally paired with caviar asthe following can demonstrate.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to Drink With Caviar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The most traditional drinks to pair it with:&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Champagne (chilled) - any good champagne will usually do, but the absolute best is a fine traditional brut or extra-brut&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Vodka (chilled) &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Dry white wine (chilled)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;And the non-so-traditional ones:&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Beer (need you ask? Ice-cold!)The tailgating party just got a first-class upgrade! The trick is to go for light beers (domestic or imported, your choice). &lt;strong&gt;Beers that are too dark will overwhelm the palate, and take away from the crisp and smooth flavor of the caviar.&lt;/strong&gt; To best enjoy, keep it simple, and pair a tall glass of ice-cold beer with a scoopful of caviar. - &lt;a href="https://www.gourmetfoodstore.com/caviar-pairings-15146" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Caviar Pairings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;They make the exact product you are looking for. Home Distillers can add flavorings to their neutral spirits with these products. &lt;a href="https://stillspirits.com/collections/vodka-shotz" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Still Spirits&lt;/a&gt; I would look around the website as there are many different types of flavorings if you are interested.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's incredibly easy to &lt;a href="http://www.mademan.com/mm/how-infuse-vodka-tea.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;infuse vodka with tea&lt;/a&gt; - unscrew the cap, force a teabag through the neck, screw the cap back on, and put it in the freezer until you're happy with it (overnight is fine). Keep the tag outside so it's easy to pull out. Tea vodka is tasty, and also makes a great base for cocktails.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can also infuse it with &lt;a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/8406-horseradish-vodka" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;horseradish&lt;/a&gt;, or ginger, or any other kind of root the same way that you would with a fruit peel - slice it thin, chuck it in, and give it a day. Unsweetened cranberries are great, and cranberry vodka is very popular in Russia and Finland.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With the right infusions, you can turn your vodka into &lt;a href="https://www.craftginclub.co.uk/ginnedmagazine/2016/5/11/how-to-make-your-own-gin-at-home-no-still-required" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;gin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/20216/simple-syrup/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Simple Syrups&lt;/a&gt; can be a great way to infuse other flavors into your vodka. To add other flavors, you would add them into the simple syrup, mashing as you go along. &lt;a href="http://byo.com/hops/item/679-fruit-brew-part-2-techniques" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;You have to consider&lt;/a&gt; the temperature and amount of fruit to add to get the desired flavor. If you are trying to follow the simple syrup recipe and bring the sugar/water/additives to a boil ASAP, you shouldn't really lose any flavor. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From personal experience (and preference), strain the simple syrup with a &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0000VLVBQ" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;cheese cloth&lt;/a&gt;, or other straining device (&lt;a href="http://www.webstaurantstore.com/10-bouillon-chinois-strainer/40740PN.html?utm_source=Google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GoogleShopping&amp;amp;gclid=CLKBhdufz9MCFdccgQodKYwLtg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;chinoise&lt;/a&gt; mentioned below). This is especially true when making things like a &lt;a href="http://heatherchristo.com/2014/05/04/strawberry-habanero-margarita/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Strawberry Habeñero Margarita&lt;/a&gt; if you add the seeds in during the simple syrup process.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Recipe: Strawberry Habanero Margarita
					  Ingredients&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;• ¼ cup Strawberry Habanero Simple Syrup
					• ¼ cup Fresh Lime juice
					• 4 ounces Grand Marnier
					• 4 ounces Tequila
					• Strawberry Habanero Simple Syrup:
					• 1 cup sugar
					• 1 cup water
					• 1 cup strawberries
					• 1 habanero with seeds
					&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Instructions for Strawberry Habañero Syrup: &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. Bring everything to a simmer and let cook for about 5 minutes over medium heat.
					2. Strain the syrup through a chinoise and reserve juice. Discard the berries and pepper.
					3. Chill the syrup.
					&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Making the drink&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. Combine ice, the syrup, the lime juice and the liquor in a cocktail shaker.
					2. Shake vigourously and then pour into a chilled ice filled glass. 

					    Preparation time: 5 minute(s)

					    Cooking time: 5 minute(s)

					    Number of servings (yield): 2
					&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Granted - you're asking about Vodka infusions... This is my relevant experience with infusions and simple syrups. 10/10 will make this margarita again.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Certain people can have very individualistic headache triggers. For me it is second hand smoke. There are quite a few references on the internet tying Splenda to migraines so perhaps it so for you, at least in combination with alcohol. In any case, I'd pitch your experiment. Vodka typically has 65 calories per ounce. Sugar is about 111. However, you probably don't add that many ounces of sugar to your bottle of vodka so most of the calories will come from the ethanol. Some people substitute agave nectar which supposedly has a &lt;a href="http://www.allaboutagave.com/agave-vs-granular.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;lower glycemic index&lt;/a&gt; than granulated sugar and may be healthier.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I know of two methods:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add some aroma-containing plant-material (herbs, spices, fruit-peel, ...) into a bottle of vodka and let it rest to infuse. Remove when desired taste is achieved. An infusion with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierochloe_odorata" rel="noreferrer"&gt;bison grass&lt;/a&gt; is well known in Poland as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BBubr%C3%B3wka" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Zubrowka&lt;/a&gt;. Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;lemongrass&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;sage (mix result with lime-juice and sugar)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;orange-peel&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;juniper (that's kind of how gin is made, i fact just look at a list of &lt;a href="http://www.annodistillers.co.uk/content/dry-gin-botanicals" rel="noreferrer"&gt;gin-botanicals&lt;/a&gt; to get ideas)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;rosemary&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;cinnamon&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;safron&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dissolve some candy in a bottle of vodka. Where i come from a handful of blue mint cooler candy dissolved in vodka is called "&lt;em&gt;smurf pee&lt;/em&gt;".  Just use real candy made from real sugar and all the flavours are yours. It tastes awfully artificial, but a lot of people like it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I actually use skittles to add flavor to vodka.The process takes a while to complete the process and get all the flavor. I found instructions that seem to be the equivalent to what I do(except I use coffee filters). Separation of the skittles is key in my opinion but whow knows you may come up with a combination that you really love. I personally just buy a large bag from Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Mixing vodka with beer is a great mix and has a definite following and is absolutely safe when drinking responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Urban Dictionary defines this mix as a &lt;strong&gt;Vodkabeer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Vodkabeer" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Vodkabeer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;A delicious mixed drink comprised of beer (usually of the lowest quality) and vodka (always from a plastic handle). The vodka is poured directly into the beer can after several sips have been taken. The vodka and beer enhance each other's flavors and the result is a drink much greater than the sum of its parts. In some circles a &lt;strong&gt;vodkabeer is also known as a skelly&lt;/strong&gt;. The drink is believed to originate in the Worcester, MA area, mainly at Holy Cross and WPI.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As Altbier is not Old Beer notes in his &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/a/4697/5064"&gt;excellent answer&lt;/a&gt; the Russians call this particular mix a &lt;strong&gt;Yorch&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=yorsh" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Yorsh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;An alcoholic-drink of Russian origin, where an ample amount of vodka is added to beer. Vodka, being largely flavourless, does not greatly alter the taste of beer but does increase the alcohol content significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of a &lt;a href="http://cocktails.wikia.com/wiki/Yorsh" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Yorsh&lt;/a&gt;, but then who measures vodka:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Ingredients&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;◾ 2 oz (60 ml) Vodka &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;9 oz (270 ml) Beer &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Directions&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ol&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fill a beer mug or stein 3/4 full with beer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add the vodka &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serve&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is one vodkabeer for summer hot summer days:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://chilledmagazine.com/van-gogh-vodka-beer-cocktails" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Beer of the Tropics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;1 oz. Van Gogh Cool Peach Vodka&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;1 oz. Van Gogh Coconut Vodka&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;1 1/2 oz. Pineapple juice&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Top with IPA style beer&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Preparation: Build ingredients directly into highball glass with ice. When pouring beer, pour slowly. Garnish with a lime wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Note: Not responsible any hangovers or any nasty aftertastes!!!!! Enjoy your vodka-beer cocktails everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
