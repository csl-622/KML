					&lt;p&gt;That is really too warm as you will get fusel oils as a bi-product.  If you absolutely must do it in that high of a temperature, I would go with an ESB or something.  If you really are going to get into this, you may want to invest in an old refrigerator and maintain around 17 - 20 degrees for an ale.  Well worth the investment if you have the space and money!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I'm assuming here you mean spontaneous fermentation, used originally in belgian lambics. Open fermentation is the practice of fermenting in an open vessel but in a controlled environment, not allowing other microorganisms to get in, like Anchor and Sierra Nevada still do these days, and sometime ago very common in the industry.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You will probably never get a definitive answer to it but based only in my theoretical knowledge I would say &lt;em&gt;terroir&lt;/em&gt; is not so determinant as people use to think, even for spontaneously fermented beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My first guess is that, aside from very extreme/sterile climates and landscapes, microflora in the air is pretty much the same, at least in terms of variety and the species that play a main role in spontaneously fermented beer, which aren't much more than a few (acetobacteria, sacharomyces, lactic bacteria and brettanomyces). I know, you can find hundreds of different bugs in a single lambic, but from all that, only a few really play an important role. You can see &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3329477/" rel="nofollow"&gt;this study here from UC Davis&lt;/a&gt;, based on Allagash's Coolship.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One thing that supports this argument is that american breweries are successfully making lambic-style beers following almost the exact same traditional process as the belgian. But, then, one thing they've already learned is that one of the main factors in the early process of inoculation and fermentation is temperature, what implies year's season as well. Usually they leave the wort to be inoculated over night at fall. You can listen to what people from Allagash say about their &lt;em&gt;Coolship Ale&lt;/em&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The rest of the process, well, now it depends on infinite factors (barrels, wood, storage, temperature, etc). But, your question was about distance between places, what suggests the &lt;em&gt;terroir&lt;/em&gt; aspect of the production. So, I would say (and that's a completely wild guess), since you're in a place surrounded by any vegetation, with a minimum of biodiversity, and have wind, it doesn't make a big deal of a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Oh, and don't forget one thing. You get (if so) a consistent and regular flavor from those kind of beers &lt;strong&gt;only because people blend it&lt;/strong&gt; before releasing, once different barrels even of the same batch turn out to be completely different one from the other. So, again, that's why I think there isn't much sense to talk about &lt;em&gt;terroir&lt;/em&gt;. It's not like grapes are to wines.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS1&lt;/strong&gt;: Off course, as climate does play a crucial role in the process, it doesn't surprise me people are doing this only in the northern hemisphere at temperate climates. I guess it wouldn't work out very well in a tropical country, which doesn't have well definite seasons, although spontaneous fermentation can be done anywhere, you just can't guarantee what is going to come out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS2&lt;/strong&gt;: If you are heavily interested in the topic, as I am, I recommend that you listen to Savor's Salons about barrel aging and blending, and sour/wild beers, available at &lt;a href="http://www.craftbeerradio.com/savor/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Craft Beer Radio&lt;/a&gt;. There has been a lot of talkings about the matter in the last years. Really interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The recommended primary fermentation time for anything you're going to bottle is: until it's done.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;After 2-3 weeks, when you think it's ready, use a wine thief to pull a sample to test with a hydrometer.  Record that number.  Then wait maybe 3 days and do it again.  Compare the new number to the first number.  If they're the same, you're safe.  If they're at all different, give it another week then repeat the whole process.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The premeasured bottling sugar or bottling sugar calculator assumes the cider is completely done fermenting, if it's not then you've suddenly overdosed the bottles with sugar which could result in an explosion.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I brew in South Florida with similar ambient temps during the spring-summer-autumn.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For beer styles, check out the saison, which enjoys a higher fermentation temperature. Wyeast 3724 has a temperature range of &lt;strong&gt;70-95F, 21-35C&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.whitelabs.com/yeast/wlp565-belgian-saison-i-yeast" rel="nofollow"&gt;attenuates up to 80%&lt;/a&gt;. I've had great success with this strain, even at the higher ends of the range.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://beerandwinejournal.com/high-temp-yeast/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Beer and Wine Journal&lt;/a&gt; has a nice list of yeasts that do well in higher temps.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;White Labs WLP550 (Belgian Ale) — 68–78°F (20–26 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;White Labs WLP566 (Belgian Saison II yeast) — 68–78°F (20–26 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;White Labs WLP568 (Belgian Style Saison Ale Yeast Blend) — 70–80 °F
					  (21–27 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;White Labs WLP065 (American Whiskey Yeast) — 75-82 °F (24–28 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;White Labs WLP655 (Belgian Sour Mix 1) — 80-85+ °F (27–29 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;White Labs WLP665 (Flemish Ale Blend) — 68-80°F (20 –27 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Wyeast 1214 (Belgian Abbey) — 68-78° F (20-24° C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Wyeast 1388 (Belgian Strong Ale) — 64-80° F (18-27° C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Wyeast 3724 (Belgian Saison) — 70-95 °F (21-35 ° C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Wyast 3725 (PC Biere de Garde) — 70-84 °F (21-29 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Wyeast 3763 (Roeselare Ale Blend) — 65-85 °F (18-30 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Wyeast 3787 (Trappist High Gravity) — 64-78 °F (18-25 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Wyeast 3822 (PC Belgian Dark Ale) — 65-80 °F (18-27 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Fermentis Safbrew T-58 — 12-25°C (54-77 °F)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Fermentis Safbrew WB-06 — 12-25°C (54-77 °F)&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're looking to bring the beer to a little bit below ambient (as fermentation is a bit of an exothermic process) try a small plastic tub full of cool water with the carboy in it wrapped in a towel. The towel will wick up cool water and evaporate, basically acting like a giant sweat gland!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the aerator top is still working, meaning that no air has gotten to the wine, you should still be able to bottle it. The best way to know is to taste it. If it tastes right, you should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for butter  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Many white wines undergo a process that causes them to take on buttery flavors (which sometimes come across as buttered popcorn or even butterscotch).  That process is called malo-lactic fermentation, and here's the quick take on how it works.  Just after the grapes are made into wine, a special type of beneficial bacteria is added to the wine.  That bacteria converts one of the acids in wine (malic) to another type of acid (lactic).  The two acids feel different on the tongue.  Malic acid is very sharp (it's the acid in a Granny Smith apple); lactic acid is fairly soft (it's the acid in milk).  Most Chardonnay's go through malo-lactic fermentation and are therefore soft and buttery. (Taken from &lt;a href="http://www.blueskyvineyard.com/why-do-wines-taste-buttery" rel="nofollow"&gt;Why Do Wines Taste Buttery?).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are several categories of organic compounds that are responsible for aromas - esters, ketones, and aldehydes are the most notable.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Esters are formed when an alcohol and an acid combine; creating esters is a common laboratory experiment in high-school chemistry - I remember making peppermint and banana.  This is the actual compound responsible for making peppermint smell like peppermint; the way we synthesized it in the lab isn't necessarily the way the peppermint plant makes it, but the result is identical.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A similar process happens during fermentation and aging of wine: the acids and alcohols present combine to form the compound that makes a cherry smell like a cherry, a thyme sprig smell like thyme, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Just to be clear, most fermented beverages are going to have some of these aroma compounds as byproducts of fermentation.  But grapes are notable in that they produce many more different acids than other fruits.  So the range of possible aroma compounds is greater in wine than in, for example, cider - since apples don't have the variety of acids that grapes do, and can't make as many different esters.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your biggest worry with an open fermentor is contamination. 
					If you've added potassium or sodium metabisulfide to the wine must, you should be safe against most wine spoiling bacteria.  However, it is advisable to cover the fermentation vessel.  See &lt;a href="https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/2199/open-fermentation-process"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; about open fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I always cover with a tea towel and tie it round the rim with string, still allows it to breathe and fights off nearly all air borne infections. You are right about the fact fermentation will be faster with the lid open, be wary of the fact it can happen to fast - if its bubbling a lot then you would be better to decrease the heat that the pan is sitting on, be that a heat mat or a floor. Happy brewing!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I was a professional wine maker for a few years. We always used open top fermenters on our red wines when they were fermenting on the skins, we just threw sheets or blankets over them to keep the bugs out. Of course we are talking about tons of grapes at a time. White wines you could do this too, but I would only as long as there is active fermentation and enough CO2 to keep the oxygen out. But for white wines we had a closed lid with way for the CO2 to escape easily. Sulfites will be blown out with an active fermentation so they are pretty useless while fermenting, but they need to be added as soon as fermentation is done. As long as there is active fermentation, it is very hard to oxidize your wine as most of the oxygen will be consumed by the yeast.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is banana beer and there is banana wine made from &lt;a href="http://Cavendishhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_banana" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Cavendish bananas&lt;/a&gt;, but they are not the same thing!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What is banana beer?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_beer" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Banana beer&lt;/a&gt; is an alcoholic beverage made from fermentation of mashed bananas. Sorghum, millet or maize flour are added as a source of wild yeast.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And there is a difference with banana wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_wine" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Banana wine&lt;/a&gt; is a fruit wine made exclusively from bananas. It is different from banana beer, which has a long tradition and great cultural significance in East Africa. Blocker et al. (2001)&lt;a href="http://Cavendishhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_banana" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; wrote a chapter on "Banana Wine" in the book "Alcohol and temperance in modern history: an international encyclopedia", though this is slightly confusing, as they define what is traditionally referred to as banana beer as being banana wine. The data they present on Production Techniques and Social Practices and Rituals relates to the latter and not to what is commonly known as banana wine.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is how to make banana beer the African way.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Bananas&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Peel ripe bananas by hand. Only use bananas ripe enough to be peeled by hand &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Extract Juice &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Use grass to knead the bananas until clear juice is extracted. The residue will remain in the grass. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Mix water &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Mix 1:3 water: banana juice ratio. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Mix sorghum &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Sorghum flour:banana juice ratio, 1:12. Stir the mixture well. Sorghum is added to improve the color and the flavor of the beer &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Ferment &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Ferment in plastic containers covered by polyethylene bags. Allow to ferment 18 -24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Filter &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Force the liquid through a cotton cloth bag either by hand or use a press. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Bottle &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Place in 1 liter size plastic bottles &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Shelf Life &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Several days, refrigerated - &lt;a href="http://www.gourmetsleuth.com/recipes/detail/african-banana-beer" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;African Banana Beer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is how to make homemade banana wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.celebrationgeneration.com/blog/2011/10/13/how-to-make-homemade-banana-wine/comment-page-1/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;How to Make Homemade Banana Wine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;21 lbs of RIPE bananas, sliced into thin rings&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;5 gallons water (You won’t use it all)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;15-20 lbs white and/or brown sugar (We used white)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;6 tsp acid blend&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;5 tsp pectinase&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;1.25 tsp wine tannin&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;6 tsp yeast nutrient&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;4 lbs golden raisins&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;1 packets of wine yeast (We like Red Star “Champagne” for this recipe)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Potassium sorbate or other wine stabilizer&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equipment&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;7.5 gallon pot (or bigger)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;1 6.5 gallon fermenter bucket and lid&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;1 or 2 6.5 gallon glass carboys &amp;amp; stoppers&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;1 air lock&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Siphon, siphon tubing.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Place raisins in a freshly sanitized 6.5 gallon fermenting bucket. Carefully strain hot banana liquid into the fermenting bucket, over top of the raisins. Top with water to 6 gallons, and add a few scoops of the banana mush. Cover with sanitized lid and air lock, allow to cool to room temperature (overnight).&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The next morning, give the mixture a quick stir with a sanitized paddle, and – using sanitized equipment – take a gravity reading. Keep track of the number! (This is an optional step, but will allow you to calculate your final ABV %)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Sprinkle yeast into fermenter, cover with sanitized cover and air lock. Within 48 hours, you should notice fermentation activity – bubbles in the airlock, carbonation and /or swirling in the wine must. This means you’re good to go! &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Let sit for about a week, stirring (sanitized paddle!) Every couple of days or so. It will get black on top. It’ll look awful… and your whole brewing area / basement / garage will smell like banana bread!&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;After a week or so, use your sanitized siphon setup to rack the must into a freshly sanitized 6.5 gallon carboy. (At this point, we ran the raisins and remaining pulp through a juicer and added it to the carboy, but that’s entirely optional. Will give the wine extra body if you do it!)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Put the carboy somewhere cool (not cold!), and leave it alone for a month or so.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Using sanitized equipment, rack the banana wine off the sediment, into a clean, freshly sanitized 6.5 gallon carboy. (At this point, we added 4 lbs sugar for added sweetness. It probably also upped the final ABV!). Cap with sanitized airlock, leave it alone for another 2-3 months.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are no alcoholic beverages made from the "nectar" of flowers per se. It would be very difficult/expensive to collect 100% flower nectar straight from flowers in sufficient quantities to make a beverage. Having said that, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey" rel="noreferrer"&gt;honey&lt;/a&gt; is essentially flower nectar collected by bees and regurgitated in the hive as a future food source. You can enjoy fermented Honey as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Mead&lt;/a&gt; in a wide variety of flavors and flower varieties. Bees store the nectar in a "honey stomach" so there is no digestion of the nectar. &lt;a href="http://ucanr.edu/blogs/blogcore/postdetail.cfm?postnum=15512" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Read in more detail here:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"Although many sources refer to the honey bee crop as the 'honey
					  stomach,' it is not a place where consumed foods are being digested in
					  honey bees."&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;In their book, Honey Bee Biology and Beekeeping, authors Dewey Caron
					  and Lawrence John "Larry" Connor define the honey stomach as a a
					  "honey sac."&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;It's "an enlargement of the posterior end of the esophagus in the bee
					  abdomen in which the bee carries the nectar from flower to hive."&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Bee vomit? No way. It's where nectar is stored. It's not a stomach as
					  we know it.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, beer is made with a flower called hops. There are many other beers and meads flavored with dried flowers. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for where to buy Mead, you can most likely find it any decent beer/wine/liquor store and easily by searching the web.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can tie of the end of banana's in flower. Come back &amp;amp; drink them for a kind of wine. Natives do. 1 taste was enough for me. Or buy the buds at the market. That are cut of trees so it produces larger banana's. Dandalion can be used to make a wine. Very good. Just stuff the jug full of flowers. Ferment , filter, drink. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's difficult to answer why fermentation did not complete without further information.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's quite possible the sugar content was too high and pH to low for whatever yeast was added to survive and begin fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Vinegar however is created when bacteria that produce acetic acid are present in an environment with a sugar source and oxygen. They will thrive off of the sugar just like brewer's yeast, but will also produce acetic acid as a byproduct of their life processes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you wish to make cherry wine, I would suggest diluting the juice down to somewhere in the range of a sugar concentration of 10 percent, measuring with a hydrometer or refractometer, and using a yeast, possibly a dry wine yeast, that can withstand alcohol in ranges of 10-14 percent abv.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Check with your local &lt;a href="http://bayareamushrooms.org/california_clubs.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;mycological society&lt;/a&gt; in your area. If it grows wild near you. You can buy grow kits and try to grow it indoors. But the mycological society is probably your best bet for finding it wild or a supplier that you can get it from.&lt;/p&gt;
