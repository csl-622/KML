					&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure about Kentucky, but it seems to be legal here in NY. I've never ordered beer online as the shipping prices are astronomical and I've got a pretty decent beer distributor down the block with a large selection. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With that said, the way it seems to work is that the delivery person (whether it be UPS, FedEx, DHL, USPS, etc) ID's you at the door when you sign for the package. I've got a big dog (Neapolitan Mastiff) though, so my package carriers usually just sign for me and run for the hills when they have the displeasure of delivering something to my house haha. So I'm not sure if they'd bother checking my ID if I ever bought beer online. I'm perfectly legal drinking age though, so it doesn't matter.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With that said, you'd probably be best off looking through your local laws and maybe start a petition to have it legalized. I don't think its in the best interests of this community to be discussing loopholes in the law (despite how much I hate the government). I say start a petition, maybe it'll become a proposition and be placed on the ballot come election day. The only other option would be to have it shipped to another address in a border state if you live near the border. No online beer distributor is going to violate the law or tamper with it to make a buck, there's too much liability; they could lose their license and be put out of business.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bluepoint Brewery&lt;/em&gt; of Long Island NY makes &lt;strong&gt;Old Howling Bastard&lt;/strong&gt; at 10% ABV (though I won't buy their beer anymore as they just sold to InBev a few weeks ago)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dirtwolf&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Victory Brewing Company&lt;/em&gt; of Pennsylvania at 8.7% ABV&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;At 9% ABV, you've got Double &lt;strong&gt;Simcoe&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Weyerbacher Brewing Co&lt;/em&gt; of Pennsylvania&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Out of NY, you have &lt;strong&gt;Unearthly&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Southern Tier&lt;/em&gt;, rolling in at 9.5% ABV&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;From NY, you've got &lt;strong&gt;He'Brew Bittersweet Lenny's R.I.P.A.&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Shmaltz Brewing Company&lt;/em&gt; at 10 % ABV&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dogfish Head&lt;/em&gt; makes other IPA's outside of the 60/90/120 Minutes. Give &lt;strong&gt;Robert Johnson's Hellhound On My Ale&lt;/strong&gt; a try (10% ABV).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;At 9.7% ABV, &lt;em&gt;Smuttynose&lt;/em&gt; of New Hampshire makes the &lt;strong&gt;Big A IPA&lt;/strong&gt; at 9.7% ABV&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stoudt's Double IPA&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Stoudt's brewing Co.&lt;/em&gt; of PA rolls in at 9.43 ABV&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;From Vermont, you've got &lt;strong&gt;Ephraim&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Hill Farmstead Brewery&lt;/em&gt; rolling in at 10.5% ABV. I've never seen a beer with a 100 rating on Beer Advocate before...good luck finding this one.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Out of Pennsylvania from &lt;em&gt;Allentown Brew Works&lt;/em&gt; you've got &lt;strong&gt;Hop'solutely&lt;/strong&gt; rolling in at 11.5% ABV&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bluepoint&lt;/em&gt; also makes &lt;strong&gt;No Apologies Imperial IPA&lt;/strong&gt; at 10% ABV. Again, my discretion about InBev still applies.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flying Dog&lt;/em&gt; out of Frederick Maryland makes &lt;strong&gt;Single Hop Imperial IPA&lt;/strong&gt; at 10% ABV&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brash Brewing Company&lt;/em&gt; of Taxachusetts makes &lt;em&gt;The Bollocks&lt;/em&gt; at a whopping 12% ABV&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think that list will do for now. Again, It'd be best to rephrase your question as I was not sure if you meant beer brewed in the Northeast or beer available there. I went with the former (since it should satisfy both conditions anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What you want to keep an eye out for are so called &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/140/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imperial IPA's&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; it is a category of high ABV IPA's&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'd say beermenus.com would be a good bet. My favorite local brewery updates &lt;a href="http://www.beermenus.com/places/5419-port-jeff-brewing-company"&gt;their page&lt;/a&gt; every other day or so.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's funny that you mention this though. I just had an email exchange with the brewmaster regarding this very thing. I asked him to set up a webcam system which will update the list of beer offerings in realtime (similar to what the &lt;a href="http://www.dogfishalehouse.com/locations/dfha-gaithersburg"&gt;Dogfish Head Ale Houses&lt;/a&gt; do at the bottom of the page). He liked the idea and said he's game for it, so hopefully we'll start seeing these type of things pop up more and more. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I think beermenus.com is your best bet (aside from calling the brewery probably). There's also a smartphone app called &lt;a href="https://untappd.com/"&gt;UnTapped&lt;/a&gt; that was pretty good at this as well, last time I checked (I'm happily a dumb phone user once again as part of a personal experiment of mine; so I haven't used it recently).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I will update this answer when I get more information from OP about region but I believe the following will be helpful: [edit]: reread the tags and spotted that it was US - think that my thoughts all still stand up but will check some specifics on US beer festivals.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the UK and a few other countries and regions organizations like CAMRA (the Campaign for Real Ale) run beer festivals which work out, on a pint for pint basis, cheaper when trying a wide variety of beers. Although there is usually an entry fee (at least as far as CAMRA events go) each drink tends to be cheaper and there is the option of trying more different beers by buying in half pint measures (recommended). The biggest benefit of going to festivals, however, is the &lt;em&gt;range&lt;/em&gt; of beers available. A liquor store / off license / bar can only really stock a few different beers and these are usually ones that they can get consistently, in volume, and at either a suitable price or within their tie (don't get me started on the beer tie), whereas festivals are much freer to buy different beers from varying sources as they are one-off events and less restricted.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A second idea would be to set up a tasting club so that you can share the costs and the beers. This runs the risk (!) of making new friends as well!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;source: I help to run a CAMRA beer festival and work at 2+ others dependent on my free time&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can look for breweries in your areas that give tours. These often include free tastings. (Since you mentioned you're from the Chicago area, I know there's a bus tour that takes you to different breweries in Chicago and Milwaukee. There's a fee, but you'd get to try a lot of different beers.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, look for brewpubs and restaurants in your area that sell &lt;em&gt;flights&lt;/em&gt; of beer. A flight is 4-5 samples of different beers served together. The cost is normally about the same as a full glass, and the total volume is usually the same or a little more. This allows you to try 4 or 5 different beers for about the same price as you'd normally pay for one.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most beer shops and some grocery stores (if that's legal in your state) allow you to do a "Mixer-Sixer" or "Create your own six-pack" where you can combine a variety of single bottles/cans for a variety six pack.  You pay a little bit extra per bottle for the convenience but and you get to pick specifically which ones you try.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To learn your preferences, I would suggest the following styles: (ordered from darkest to lightest with a recommended beer in parenthesis)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Stout (Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Double Bock/Doppelbock (Ayinger Doppelbock)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;IPA (Dogfish Head 60min or 90min IPA)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Pale Ale (Sierra Nevada Pale Ale)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Pilsner (Bell's Beer by Bells Brewery - this is a traditional Czech Pilsner)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Hefeweizen (Paulaner Bavarian Hefeweizen)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;@Bill The Lizard's answer:  Going on a brewery tour is definitely good advice.  Additionally, you should consider getting beer on tap which tends to be fresher and in better condition while at restaurants or breweries.  Furthermore, if you have the chance to visit a brewery, you should specifically try their seasonal, limited, and special releases.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you venture west to Iowa most HyVee stores will let you do the mixer-sixer as Gastrograph describes. Two of Iowa's best breweries are on the eastern side of the state as well in Toppling Goliath and Backpocket.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I live in a state that (mostly) requires that you buy beer by the case.  I feel your pain.  ("Mostly": there's still the bar option, and there are a very few places where you can buy mixed cases or six-packs of things other than the big mainstream beers.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The solution I'm partial to is the beer co-op.  Mine started as a group of coworkers; we've scattered to a bunch of different companies by now, but the co-op remains.  Every 4-6 weeks the organizer sends out email announcing a planned buy, with the goal of getting a multiple of 8 people (12 works, but we prefer 8).  Participants get a case with variety of beers and divide the total cost.  I've gotten to sample some beers I'd never have tried (or known about) otherwise.  (Most people don't participate every time, but the organizer does because, hey, beer.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're doing a co-op anyway, then it's easy to add on the occasional "side buy" -- something that comes in 25oz bottles, or is particularly expensive, etc.  So long as there's enough interest to get the case, people can then buy them individually.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can be very organized about this, requiring commitments in advance, or you can be flexible and deal with the occasional surplus.  People interested enough to organize co-ops &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; don't mind some surplus (assuming finances aren't too tight).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I also live in PA and am equally baffled by the PALCB regulations. If I had a dime for every time an out of stater asked me where they could buy alcohol, I could buy a brewery.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My guess would be the local beer you tried just hasn't gotten to registering in PA.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as opinions and rules on what beers can and can't be sold in PA, I'd think there are no official "rules", especially given the wide assortment of beer our supreme liquor overlords graciously allow us to consume. (I too could not find any set of standards for beer in PA)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If there is a vetting process, it's probably a black-box (Request goes in, ruling comes out with no hows or whys).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can visit &lt;a href="http://freemybeer.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;freemybeer.com&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about the restrictions in PA and learn how to contact your state representatives about changing the laws.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Don Russell asked Francesca Chapman (PLCB's Spokeswoman) in a Daily News article. Her response:
					"the registration requirement helps the state assure payment of state beer taxes and helps prosecutors identify alcoholic beverages in drunk driving cases or any other types of prosecution."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Article with some good points and source of quote &lt;a href="http://noplcb.blogspot.com/2010/03/why-does-beer-brand-registration-exist.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Mead is an entirely different product which tastes more like a wine than a beer but is quite distinct from either in terms of taste, designation and production. I have never come across a mead flavoured with hops but some are flavoured with other botanicals such as spices or orange peel  so I cannot guarantee that none are.
					Most beer breweries undertake a more complex brewing process involving adding ingredients to the mash at different stages and as such, knowing a few hundred UK brewers as I do, they are all about getting the complex mixture correct and blending ingredients correctly they are disinterested in the simple mead making process. That said the mead making process; adding honey to water, adding yeast and letting it ferment may be boring to them it doesn't mean that none do, &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; I have never known any to be interested.
					On the other hand some wineries in the UK have their own beehives to help pollinate their fruit and so they produce mead as a side product. This may also be true in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A quick search bears out my thoughts on wineries in the US: &lt;a href="http://www.stormthecastle.com/mead/where-to-buy-mead.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Where to buy Mead&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Mead is not considered a style of beer, since the sugars in mead come from honey, not from the starch of a grain. Hops are sometimes added to mead for flavor and as a preservative.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The process for making mead is more similar to wine making than brewing beer. There's no brewing (boiling) stage necessary in making mead. All of the fermentable sugar comes from the honey in mead, so you just mix honey with water (and whatever spices you want) and go directly to the fermenting stage. Mead also has a higher alcohol content than most beers (8 - 20%, which is more similar to wine, or even brandy).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;...would it be reasonable to think a brewery I like may make, or consider making mead as well?&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not really. At least not in the U.S. Beer is much more popular than mead, and the process for making mead is different, so relatively few brewers are going to make it. I tried mead once at a specialty beer &amp;amp; wine store, which is your best bet for finding it in the U.S. You may have to ask around to see if a store can order some for you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is a link to the &lt;a href="http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt?open=18&amp;amp;objID=737863&amp;amp;mode=2" rel="noreferrer"&gt;application for for registering beer brands&lt;/a&gt; As you can see on the form, there is a fee of $75 for each "beer brand". They define a "brand" as an individual beer style.  No big deal if you are Miller/Coors/Bud, but a real hassle if you are a micro with a couple of dozen seasonal beers. Note that you also must list the "importing distributors with whom territorial agreements have been established". So, I can see that getting a foot in the door would be a daunting task for a small brewery. And once a brewery is established, the process starts over every time they develop a new beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can thank &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gifford_Pinchot" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Gifford Pichot&lt;/a&gt; for this mess. He was the prohibitionist governor of PA when prohibition ended, and he established the PA LCB and State Store system to "discourage the purchase of alcoholic beverages by making it as inconvenient and expensive as possible." Recent efforts to reform the system keep failing because there are too many entrenched interests making money off of the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In addition to what was already said, there's a lot of legal gray area, as most if not all states have different laws governing breweries and wineries.  Mead is really something different than both, but I believe most meaderies choose to identify as wineries, and many if not all states prohibit wineries from having malt on premises, and breweries MUST use malt in fermentation.  You'd either need to find someone that has a license for both beer and wine, which probably isn't that common in commercial operations (brewpubs may be your best bet there), or look for someone who makes a braggot, which is generally a beer/mead blend.  Dogfish Head makes Bitches' Brew, and Sprecher Brewery just released a braggot this year.  If you're looking to buy, wine shops are generally a better bet - again, lots of people don't know exactly what to do with mead, but I've had good luck finding it, usually around the dessert wines, sherry, port type of wines.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You have to think of the volume of beer that's actually made. The big 'non-craft' brewers produce huge amounts of lager because the tradition for last hundred years or so has been to make lighter, more 'drinkable' beers. That also happens to fit with the big business ideal of being cheap to produce (light &amp;amp; drinkable means corn &amp;amp; rice are OK!). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Craft brewer tend to make ales for a few reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Prior to the explosion of lagers, most beer in the world was ale, and
					there are many more styles &amp;amp; different kind of yeast to choose from
					if you make ale.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Most ales can be produced faster than lagers, which is helpful when
					your brewery is small.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Ales are easier to make at home, so home brewers are quite familiar
					with these styles (and sometimes become pros as well).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.brewersassociation.org/statistics/national-beer-sales-production-data/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Numbers&lt;/a&gt;: as of last year, the thousands of craft breweries in the US still only had 11% of market share. Big breweries still crank out ~3/4 of US consumption, nearly all lager.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;States often have different laws for beer and spirits, including different licensing requirements, different requirements for sales, and so forth.  Because of that, some states have limits on the percentage of alcohol that is allowed in beer.  In North Carolina, where I live, all spirits sales are state-controlled, and retail sales are only allowed in state-owned Alcohol Beverage Commission stores.  Beer, however, can be sold by traditional private retailers such as grocery stores and convenience stores.  Because of this, North Carolina also limits how much alcohol beer can contain; the maximum here is 15% ABV. (alcohol by volume.)  So, Samuel Adams Utopias is indeed illegal here, as are a number of Dogfish Head beers, and a few others.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Simplified definition:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're fermenting grains, it's beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're fermenting fruits, it's wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're fermenting honey, it's mead.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's not really that simple, because there are beers that use fruit (e.g., cherry lambic, raspberry wheat), beers that use honey (it's a fairly common adjunct), wines that use fruit (e.g., &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EtZoMR4nN8" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;elderberry wine&lt;/a&gt;), and a whole lot of meads that use fruit. The crossover is substantial. When you consider hard ciders, it gets even more complicated (is apple wine really a cider?).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The base ingredient of beer is almost always malted barley. Even beers named for another grain — like wheat beer, oatmeal stout, rye beer — use malted barley as a base. Hops are a critical ingredient in beer for two reasons: bittering and aroma.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The base ingredient of mead is always honey. I've had mead with hops (&lt;a href="http://charmcitymeadworks.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Charm City&lt;/a&gt; makes one), but it's uncommon, and I personally don't like the flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's more common to find a winery that makes mead than a brewery that makes mead. There's an outstanding one in Montana called &lt;a href="https://www.hiddenlegendwinery.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Hidden Legend&lt;/a&gt;. They also make a mead/wine blend called a "pyment," which was popular in the 15th century or so.&lt;/p&gt;
