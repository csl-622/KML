					&lt;p&gt;I suspect this really boils down to each persons' chemistry.  IPA's don't have any real negative impact on me in terms of hangovers but Budweiser (as a prime example) has a much faster onset of hangover for me and I suffer far worse from it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The "Ice Beers" that became popular in the early 90's really caused me to have a lot of problems but, again, IPA's of all stripes typically don't bother me at all.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Although as Bill said it can be down to a persons chemistry. One reason for you finding that IPAs affect you more could be the higher hop content in a Pale Ale (IPAs in particular). Hops (the oils) can have an effect on brain chemistry, that affect can be positive or it can be negative!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some people can actually have alergic reactions to hops, or even beer in general (poor them, see &lt;a href="http://www.md-health.com/Beer-Allergy.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;). Where as I suffer from some nasty migraine problems and actually find that well hopped ales alleviate some of the symptoms (not that I use it as a reason to drink!!).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So to sum up is it possible that you find that IPAs cause you to suffer more in the morning because you have a slight intolerance to higher hopped beers. Where as your fellow drinkers do not.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's true that there are &lt;a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/human-biology/hangover3.htm"&gt;different types of hangovers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, those are mostly the result of differences in the impurities in the alcohol (that is, all the non-alcohol stuff that differentiates beer from wine from vodka).  And for those differences, it's largely the difference between different types of liquor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer is, compositionally, pretty much the same.  There might be enough difference between a heavy chocolate stout and a hoppy IPA, but between different brands of lighter beers (like pilsners), there's unlikely to be a noticeable difference in hangovers barring a weird food allergy to a minor element of one pilsner vs another.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some far more likely causes of your friends reporting worse hangovers for different brands of the same beer type are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Different quantities between evenings.  One evening you drank 10 Pilsner Urquells and the next you drink 8 Beck's.  How well are you really counting at that point?  If you think you had "about 9 beers" both nights, you might blame the worse hangover on Pilner Urquell.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Differences in alcohol level between brands.  The difference between 3.8% and 4.2% adds up after a while.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Small sample size.  Would you rely on a medical study of only 3 or 4 people?  Probably not.  Likewise, if your friend reports getting a bad hangover the last 3 or 4 times they drank Konig, it may just be a bit of coincidence, and they would have had a nasty hangover those nights regardless of what they drank.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes, they contain adjuncts which aren't malted barley to make them cheaper to produce. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These adjuncts aren't the same type of sugar so are fermented differently than maltose. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That is possible to a level, but not proven, and probably does not make a huge difference, as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangover#Causes" rel="nofollow"&gt;there are &lt;strong&gt;many factors causing hangover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, some stronger than others. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Moreover, that would be saying that all commercial beers have the same effects and all local brewed ales have the same other (better) effect, which sounds to me very simple and convenient to conclude.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That being said, adjuncts in mass-produced beers may still play a role, but I would tend to seek the explanation for the hangover difference in context first.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But anyway, hangover mechanisms are not well understood, so I could be wrong !&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This does indeed happen to me, too. So I stopped drinking beer where the ingredients aren't listed or if I think the beer is likely to contain GMO. Call me a tree hugger I don't care;-)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I remember reading the head aches may come from fusel oils, which are byproducts of fermentation. Depending on the ingredients there may be more or less of them. I remember reading a while back that mold and spoilage can cause a higher concentration of those fusel oils in the wine; hence, wine made from handpicked grapes is of higher quality. I wouldn't be surprised if it's similar in beer production&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A while back Jim Koch, the owner of Boston Beer Company, said in an interview that his secret to hangover avoidance was straight up eating live brewer's yeast.  This is probably dubious at best, but if you had to stretch to make something sound plausible...yeast has a good amount of Vitamin B and Magnesium, which are essential nutrients.  Anything marketed as Real Ale is likely unfiltered and will therefor have more live yeast in it than filtered ale or lager.  So it could, in theory, maybe, sortof, a bit, if you squint at it, sideways, have something to do with buffering the hangover better vs filtered ale or lager.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It may also be an adjunct fermentation or ABV related thing like others have mentioned.  Or it may not?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think there is probably some truth to the general responses here. I too am a big IPA fan and when I first started drinking them, I had no major issues with hang overs, outside of the fact that they have a much higher gravity. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My own experience over the last year is that I've witnessed a peculiar tendency to get very clogged sinuses the morning after just a handful of IPAs (really any brand). This it to say that the reaction is due to something in the beer other than the alcohol, because less hoppy beers do not offend my sinuses as much.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Could this perhaps have do do with the way people tend to drink these particular styles? In the circles I run in, Belgian- and Trappist-style beers tend to get revered, pondered, and savored, and thus drunk more slowly and possibly in lower quantities than IPAs, which are more plentiful, generally cheaper, and tend to get pounded by the six-pack next to some hot wings or a cheeseburger.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As stated many times above, it's very personal on what affects you and how much or how little.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Dry-hopped beers seem to give me worse hangovers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, 13 of the big bottles of Franziskaner in a night makes me want to die the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I used to work with a group of Russians. They introduced me to Wodka and told me that Wodka will never give you a hangover if you stick to Wodka only - and don't drink any other alcoholic beverages shortly before, in between or after. The reasoning was that hangovers feel like they do not so much because of the alcohol, but because of impurities. Good Wodka consists of extremely little impurities (a large part of it is just alcohol and water) and thus apparently is less likely to cause a hangover.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I found this to be true, provided the Wodka is of reasonable quality (Stolichnaya seemed to work well in this respect) and enough water is taken to avoid dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two things have to be considered&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The first, as Lying Dog said, is impurities. In fact, if they give taste, they also give you hangover&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The second, much more important is the fact that alcohol is diuretic. Once drunk, the alcohol is converted into several substances (in several steps) by your liver. The problem is once the last substances cannot be converted into anything useful, it will be ejected from your body. How ? By urinating. But urinating requires water. The problem is that if you do not drink water as much as needed, your body will take it from where it can, including from your brain. Now think about a sponge left without water inside and you'll have a good idea of what your brain looks like after a night, inducing hangover the next morning.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To answer your question&lt;/strong&gt;, yes, Vodka is the most efficient alcohol to avoid hangover. But you can also avoid it by drink enough water while drinking alcohol (typically, if I'm at a party where I drink a lot of alcohol, I drink a pint of water after 2 or 3 beers)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have voted to close, as this is entirely opinion based. The only hangover I have ever had was from my stag do - and it was caused by drinking everything all at once. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I can happily drink any spirits, beers, cocktails or wines with no ill effects the next day - but I have 2 friends who get bad hangovers from Vodka.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is no single answer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I can drink you a bottle of 80 degrees Stroh but have nothing from it the next day,because I follow 2 rules:
					&lt;p&gt;1. Drink a lot of water when drinking heavy(NOT Coca-Cola or other stuff,just WATER)
					&lt;p&gt;2. Never combine hard drinks like Vodka with Absinthe&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Drinking less is the obvious solution.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But you can also reduce the causes:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One cause for a hangover are the metabolic products of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusel_alcohol" rel="noreferrer"&gt;fusel alcohols&lt;/a&gt; (unwanted alcohols) in your drinks. First your body metabolizes the ethanol and then the fusel alcohols. That's why drinking alcohol helps against a hangover as if gives the body some more ethanol to work on and thus reduces the toxins of the fusel alcohols. That's why a Bloody Mary is a well known hangover cure.
					So try reducing the amount of fusel alcohols you consume by choosing high quality drinks that have less of them.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another cause is dehydration and lack of electrolytes. So start hydrating yourself before, while and after you consume alcohol. And to keep the water in your body, make sure, you add enough electrolytes to bind the water. In russia and other slavic countrys there is a culture of eating salty (electrolytes and increasing thirst), sour (helps making you thirsty) and fatty (proteins and delays alcohol absorbtion) food along with drinking. In a way it's like having a hangover breakfast while drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;All of this can be done when you wake up with a hangover: drinking some alcohol as "hair of the dog" (this will reduce the symtoms but increase the time you feel them but won't fix anything!), eating a rich breakfast, drinking lots of water (tea, juice, ...) and maybe pop a blood-thinner like ASS (Aspirin).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One time in the past an old friend of mine suggested something cleverly simple:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink lots of water before going to bed and you won't have as much of a hangover.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Really, it is that simple. It works for me since then.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To have an even smaller hangover, drink in between three drinks, one glass of water&lt;/strong&gt;(here in Germany you can get tap water for free in pubs).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The effect is really impressive.
					I already experimented with spirits and beer and sometimes a mixed beer like "Radler" in between can help, too.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Try it out and tell me if it works for you too.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Isotonic sports drink does it for me, hangovers are a lot to do with dehydration - its a good way to rehydrate :) Vitim C is good too, and lots of it - berocca is amazing for hangovers. Its its a bad hangover best way is to drink loads of water, like 4 liters. Will soon go away after that! Bloody mary is the best way but thats a dangerous road to go down! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Certain people can have very individualistic headache triggers. For me it is second hand smoke. There are quite a few references on the internet tying Splenda to migraines so perhaps it so for you, at least in combination with alcohol. In any case, I'd pitch your experiment. Vodka typically has 65 calories per ounce. Sugar is about 111. However, you probably don't add that many ounces of sugar to your bottle of vodka so most of the calories will come from the ethanol. Some people substitute agave nectar which supposedly has a &lt;a href="http://www.allaboutagave.com/agave-vs-granular.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;lower glycemic index&lt;/a&gt; than granulated sugar and may be healthier.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hangover is the manifestation of poisoning by the intermediate product of alcohol decomposition : aldehydes. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Asian people as well as some blue eyed blond people have harder time decomposing those in harmless molecules. Aldehydes have also a link to the taste of the beverages as they contain some. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Producing the molecule that breaks down aldehydes require lots of water, but most alcoholic beverages are diuretics, meaning that drinking more water will make aldehyde deshydrogenase production a bit higher. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So drink water and have a balanced diet to lessen the effects of hangovers. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, smoking reduce the speed of action of aldehyde deshydrogenase since the reaction required oxygen. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;No sugar in your mixed drinks. Diet everything or water. I drink vodka and diet tonics and haven't had a hangover in ages. If you get a hangover from beer then I recommend trying higher quality beers&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It basically counts on "how bad" your hangover is. But these are the things I usually do.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Drink a glass of cold coke.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Pure black coffee - If you can't drink it black, try to just add sugar to it.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Milk/Tea with milk.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some people don't suggest any Milk based/Cream based drink - but what can I say, these work for me. Give it a try though.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I  am a thin girl so I should not be able to drink like I can but I have secrets to my success. I  make sure to drink plenty of clear fluids the day of or before. Always drink beer before liquor. I don't like to eat a bunch before I start drinking but rather save the feasting for the end of the night.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Limit: So, I would speculate that if you're "vaping" the same quantity of alcohol as you might instead drink, then you're facing the same risk. It's the same as drinking alcohol - the risk is cumulative and hard to define - it really &lt;a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/alcohol-related-brain-impairment" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;depends&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;how much&lt;/strong&gt; you drink and &lt;strong&gt;how often&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Effect on lungs: Frankly this is hard to say, as I am quite confident there have been no large scale (AKA reputable) studies (nor can I find any) performed on the effect of vaping alcohol on lung tissues. I would &lt;em&gt;expect&lt;/em&gt; the effects to be minimal, but then again, personally, I'd probably still just stick to drinking my alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I can't provide any scientific basis to this, but I am thoroughly confident that vaping is simply a fad or novelty to enjoy - think of the increased costs and lack of accessibility compared to just drinking alcohol - you simply need a bottle of beer and a fridge, or a bottle of spirits and a glass versus a specialised glass, tea candle, vapour catching vessel and a &lt;strong&gt;glass or metal straw&lt;/strong&gt; (seriously, who keeps one of them around?).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hangovers are worse depending on sugar content regardless of type of alcoholic beverage. Mixed drinks that use sugar free mixes don’t hurt as much the next day so figure out the sugar content.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;my own personal experience is that organic wine, red, white or sparkling is an alcoholic beverage which does not give you a headache. seem that pesticides and additives in regular none organic wine is the reason for headaches the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
