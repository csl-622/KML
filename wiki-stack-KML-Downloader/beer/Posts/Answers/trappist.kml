					&lt;p&gt;Trappist beers are all abbey beers, but not all abbey beers are trappist. It's a bit like champagne, it's a protected product name to designate a certain type of classical brewn beers.Trappist is the enumeration of beers brew within the walls of an abbey inhabitted by the Trappist monks of the Tre Fontane. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Currently (Okt. 2015) there are 11 recognized trappists, of which 10 are actively producing: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Six Belgian trappists:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Chimay &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Orval&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Westmalle&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Westvleteren (St. Sixtus)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Achel (St.  Benedictus of the Achelse kluis)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Rochefort&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Netherlands:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;La Trappe (Brouwerij de Koningshoeven)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Zundert (Brouwerij Abdij Maria Toevlucht)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Austria: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Stift Engelszell&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Italy:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Tre Fontane Abbey&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;United States of America:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Spencer&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There's also one aspiring Trappist brewery in the US named St. Joseph’s Abbey.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are some strict rules to obtain "Authentic Trappiste Product":&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The beer must be brewed within the walls of a Trappist monastery,
					either by the monks themselves or under their supervision.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The brewery must be of secondary importance within the monastery and
					it should witness to the business practices proper to a monastic way
					of life&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The brewery is not intended to be a profit-making venture.  The
					income covers the living expenses of the monks and the maintenance
					of the buildings and grounds.  Whatever remains is donated to
					charity for social work and to help persons in need.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are some standardized naming conventions, for instance the Double (orginally used by Westmalle) is a brown ale which has an alcohol level of around 7%. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Tripple is another name first used by Westmalle, which are often blond and have an alcohol level of about 8% to 10%. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For future reference you can always visit the &lt;a href="http://www.trappist.be/en/pages/trappist-beers" rel="nofollow"&gt;Trappiste website here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Orval is in a category of its own, it's not an amber or a blonde beer, it has a fresh flavor, but it's not a sour or fruit beer either. Generally it falls under the Belgian Pale Ales.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bNvYJ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Orval has a very traditional and unique brewing process which involves
					 the use of dry hopping, in which large meshed bags of hops infuse the beer during the three-week maturation period. The other is the use of Brettanomyces yeast during this same maturation, which are a local wild yeast. Hallertau, Styrian Goldings and French Strisselspalt hops are used. The beer is then matured at 15°C for a minimum of four weeks on site before being distributed.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If drunk right after bottling it has a "young" fresh flavor. The beer can be preserved for several years as it re-ferments once bottled. Even 35 year old Orval is still drinkable, if preserved at the right temperature. After about 1 year of preservation the beer flavor changes to a softer, sweeter and more intense experience compared to the young one.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are two versions of Orval, one is the normal one which can be bought in the stores and then there is also a special &lt;em&gt;Petite Orval&lt;/em&gt;, which can only be drunk at the Orval abbey and is only produced for the Monks (no mass sale). Its alcohol percentage is a lot lower than the normal Orval. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Orval is brewed primarily with pale malt (with some caramel malt) so it can most reasonably be classified as a Belgian Pale Ale.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am not sure about this but as it occurs to me, through the years these abbey breweries got larger and get operated with more efficiency and more modern equipment (I guess!!).
					What I do know however: Chimay is one of the largest Trappist brewers so it's not that weird that it's widely available. With hundreds (thousands!) of beers in Belgium, Chimay is a popular beer, but far from the most popular. I think that's the reason why they can sell a lot abroad.
					Also a fact, beers like Westvleteren (that won a lot of prizes) are even in Belgium (where it is brewed) pretty rare and hard to get. Basically you have to go to the Abbey yourself to get some beer. If you're there, you only get ONE crate (6 beers) per person. I was lucky enough to visit Westvleteren a while ago and found out that in the nearby cafe you also could buy one crate per person, however there were only about 100 crates available that day and only one type was available. You can drink all types though by ordering it to drink in the café (3 types).
					If you would ever want to taste Westvleteren but cannot find it, Sint-Bernardus Abt 12 is a very similar beer. I've heard that it is brewn exactly the same way but with some slight differences.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimay_Brewery" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wikipedia's article&lt;/a&gt; leads to several sources that substantiate what @ValentinGregoire preempted. For example, Chimay put up &lt;a href="http://www.chimay.com/en/art-of-brewing.html?IDC=284" rel="nofollow"&gt;a series of short video clips&lt;/a&gt; that take us through surprisingly up-to-date facilities capable of bottling up to 40,000 bottles a day! (Probably it's just my own prejudices—associating monks and monasteries with old times, thus old technologies—causing surprise in my case.) With many other competing beers, and demand checked by relatively higher prices, the abbey alone suffices.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The volume produced, according to &lt;a href="http://marketsmedia.com/chimay-turns-150-week-manchester-pub-nyc-celebrates/" rel="nofollow"&gt;this 2012 article&lt;/a&gt;, is 120,000 hectoliters of beer annually, or 16,000,000 bottles (750 mL) of beer. To put this in some perspective, according to &lt;a href="http://celebrator.com/archives/2007/12/gh_belgianbeer.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;this 2008 article&lt;/a&gt; St. Bernardus at the time was exporting to 20 countries and producing 13,000 hectoliters (considerably lesser than Chimay) annually. And as @ValentinGregoire started saying, Westvleteren is difficult to find because the monks of the abbey of Saint Sixtus decided not to increase production despite the beer's popularity, and thus produce only 4,800 hectoliters according to a 2005 publication.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For me, it's hard to grasp such large numbers in any meaningful way. I looked up Stella Artois' production figures (and not because it's Belgian—it was just the first popular, global beer to come to mind), and found that in 2012 they produced a little over 10,000,000 hectoliters that year. Divide that by Chimay's 120,000 hectoliters per annum. Can I believe that 83 units of Stella are being consumed for every 1 equivalent unit of Chimay? Meant only as a sanity check and not any rigorous argument, it checks out as believable to me—after all, Stella's on draught all over the U.S. (I can't speak for other countries but I'm sure everywhere else too).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Stan Hieronymus, the author of "Brew Like a Monk" has some info on his website (from 2006) about production numbers from various Monasteries:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Monastery    Production Brew staff      Monks   Monks in br’y
					Achel        2,000 HL   2               17      1
					Chimay       120,000 HL 82              20      0  
					Orval        45,000 HL  32              16      0
					Rochefort    18,000 HL  15              17      6
					Westmalle    120,000 HL 41              20      0
					Westvleteren 4,750 HL   10              28      7
					&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Stan also mentions in Ep 37 of &lt;a href="http://beersmith.com/blog/2012/04/30/brewing-like-a-monk-with-stan-hieronymous-beersmith-podcast-37/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Beersmith Radio&lt;/a&gt; that some of these Monasteries own their own bottling plants and production facilities.  I can't remember which one, but one of the Abbey's facility that they operate out of is owned by Heineken, but operated by the monks.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trappist_beer"&gt;Trappist beer&lt;/a&gt; is a designation of the origin of the beer, rather than a designation for the style.  That is, it must come from one of the ten Trappist monasteries &lt;a href="http://www.trappist.be/en/pages/trappist-beers"&gt;recognised by the International Trappist Association&lt;/a&gt;.  There are similarities between the styles produced by these monasteries, but if one decided to make something in a completely different style it could presumably still be called a Trappist beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the term &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_in_Belgium#Abbey_beers"&gt;abbey beer&lt;/a&gt; is used to refer to any beers produced in the style of the Trappist monasteries.  It isn't necessarily produced by a monastery, and some beers produced by major breweries could be described as abbey beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is kind of like the difference between "Champagne" and "sparkling white wine".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is exactly as you would interpret it from the name. It is brewed in abbeys. Monks started brewing beer to gain money. Beer was very popular in the middle ages and water was mostly infected. The brewing process would cleanse the water from bacteria and other filthy stuff because of the boiling process. Some unofficial abbey beers are in fact not linked officially to an abbey but use the name to gain profit out of this. I am not sure whether the monks still brew it completely themselves, but I would strongly believe that they are still hugely involved.
					The Trappist is a special and rare beer that is also an abbey beer. An abbey beer can only be called Trappist if it is brewed by monks that are Cisterciënzers. The only trappist beers in the world: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Achel   Abdij van Achel (Belgium)
					Chimay  Abdij Notre-Dame de Scourmont (Belgium)
					Engelszell  Stift Engelszell (Austria)
					La Trappe   Abdij Koningshoeven (The Netherlands)
					Orval   Abdij Notre-Dame d'Orval (Belgium)
					Rochefort   Abdij Notre-Dame de Saint-Rémy (Belgium)
					Spencer Saint Joseph's Abey (USA)
					Westmalle   Abdij van Onze-Lieve-Vrouw van het Heilig Hart (Belgium)
					Westvleteren    Sint-Sixtusabdij (Belgium)
					Zundert Abdij Maria Toevlucht (The Netherlands)
					&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The name 'Enkel' simply isn't used anymore. Enkel means 'single', meaning it is the strength of beer made by the abbey without doing anything extra to it. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Several (most? all?) of the Trappist abbeys sell a beer the ~6% range, dubbel and tripel, are stronger, but not double or triple alcohol content. I can only speculate as to whether anything is doubled or tripled to get those styles. Double or triple amounts of grain should give quite a bit higher alcohol than they actually have. Any Trappists on this site to explain?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Dubbel/Triple/Quad designations are totally separate from the Trappist label.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Trappists are an official Catholic religious order that follow the rules of St. Benedict, one of which states "&lt;strong&gt;for then are they monks in truth, if they live by the work of their hands"&lt;/strong&gt;.  The monasteries all make goods, most commonly beer and cheese, that they sell in order to fund themselves.  Several of the monasteries form the &lt;strong&gt;International Trappist Association&lt;/strong&gt; in order to prevent anyone who's not actually a part of the order from using the name Trappist on their products.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But Trappist ale isn't really a style, it's a commercial seal like "Organic".  Both Dubbel and Tripel originated as names of specific beers brewed by Trappists at the Westmalle abbey.  Dubbel coming to use in the 1850s and Tripel (1950s) being a renamed and slightly hoppier version of what the monks used to call Superbier (1930s).  Quadrupel is a brand of La Trappe made at the Koningshoeven abbey, which was probably introduced some time in the 1990's. Koningshoeven Also used to market a beer named Enkel, but stopped production in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In all cases the popularity of the beers led to imitation by other brewers which sort of turned their brand names into loose stylistic designations.  It'd be like if people started imitating Stone's Arrogant Bastard and started producing their own Arrogant ale.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The dubbel/tripel classifications come from the process of &lt;a href="http://morebeer.com/brewingtechniques/library/backissues/issue2.2/mosher.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;parti-gyle brewing&lt;/a&gt;: tripels come from the extremely high gravity (~1.080 gravity) first runnings of the wort from the lauter tun to boil pot; dubbels come from the slightly lower (~1.060 gravity) second runnings. The term "enkel" does not figure into Stan Hieronymus's &lt;em&gt;Brew Like a Monk&lt;/em&gt;, but according to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trappist_beer#Others" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wikipedia article on "Trappist beer"&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Enkel, meaning "single", is a term formerly used by the Trappist breweries to describe the basic recipe of their beers.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This makes sense, considering the classifications "dubbel" and "tripel" simply refer to different stages of brewing one recipe. Also worth noting is that the "quadrupel" is not a traditional Trappist beer designation. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Indeed to confirm what others have said above, it is my understanding that the enkel or single bier was consumed by the monks, to prevent them from getting drunk all the time because it was weak bier, but they sold the stronger biers (dubbel, tripel etc...) to make money. Which is also why you don't see enkel biers in stores today.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"Trappist" isn't so much a style as it is a commercial label.  Something like "Organic" or "Kosher" that comes with a set of regulated conditions that product was produced under.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Per &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trappist_beer"&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, to be able to be labelled a Trappist beer:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The beer must be brewed within the walls of a Trappist monastery, either by the monks themselves or under their supervision.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The brewery must be of secondary importance within the monastery and it should witness to the business practices proper to a monastic way of life&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The brewery is not intended to be a profit-making venture. The income covers the living expenses of the monks and the maintenance of the buildings and grounds. Whatever remains is donated to charity for social work and to help persons in need.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Trappist breweries are constantly monitored to assure the irreproachable quality of their beers.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A lot of those monasteries also make lighter or hoppy beers.  Engelszell even uses honey in their beers, so there's a pretty significant variety when it comes to what you can call "Trappist".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But if we're talking the classic dark Belgian-y abbey ale.  According to the Beer Advocate ratings, the top Trappist-produced beers are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Westvleteren 12&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Rochefort 10&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Chimay Cinq Cents&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Achel Extra Blond&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Rochefort 8&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Through user rankings.  The Brothers that run the site give Rochefort 8 a higher rank than 10, which I agree with, and give both Rochefort's a higher rating than Westy 12.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So I guess the answer is that somewhere between Westvleteren 12, the Rochefort 8 and 10, and Chimay is the best Trappist beer.  But even in the top 5 here there's some variation since Chimay and Achel are blondes, and Rochefort 8 is a fair lower ABV than the other 3.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With the styles being so wide, the real answer is probably whichever one you like drinking the most.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Though really, Rochefort 8 forever.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Cellar temperature is generally anywhere between 7-18 degrees Celsius (45-65F) though people don't often go above 13C (55F), so there's a decent range to be in.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can use your fridge.  For comparison you can fill a glass with the same volume of liquid and set it next to the bottle, leaving a thermometer in it.  As long as they start off near the same temperature, that'll give you a pretty close approximation of the current temperature of the beer.  It might be easier to chill to the fridge temperature then let them warm back up.  It's not going to damage the beer and most fridges are close to the bottom end of "cellar" anyway so it won't take too long to warm up to where you want it.  Evaporation and glass thickness are going to create a difference, but given the range of temperatures, it should be close enough.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to get really fancy, water is a much better conductor of thermal energy than air.  You could get a large jug and fill it with 13C water, then put one of the Westy bottles in it for maybe 10-20 minutes, stirring frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Though all that said, when trying expensive and multifaceted beers like this, I really enjoy chilling them to my fridge temperature then nursing the beer for a good while to compare the flavors as it warms up.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As said, Trappist isn't a style but something like a certificate of origin and, let's say, quality standards. That put aside, it can be anything. Belgians themselves don't give a damn about style definitions actually. They only follow their traditions (from the region where they live, their monastery, their community, whatever).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, you are going to find beers varying from very shinning blonde to dark/ruby and thick ones that almost resembles a wine, which is the case of &lt;em&gt;Westvleteren 12&lt;/em&gt;, that one being the myth it is because it is not sold (at least officially) outside the monastery, and one is supposed to schedule and go pick it up personally with an amount limit, and everything. Off course, although I'm sure it is a really good beer (I've never had it), all that difficulty to get it undeniably contributes to its fame.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I find &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rochefort 10&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (a belgian dark strong ale as &lt;em&gt;Westvleteren 12&lt;/em&gt;) one of (if not the) best, certainly my very favorite on the list, but on the other end of the flavor range, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Achel 10&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (a strong golden ale) is my favorite blonde/pale trappist as well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;La Trappe&lt;/em&gt;, which is the biggest trappist brewery, has at least twice the labels other breweries have, and is widely available on market, still has very good beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, the short answer is: trappist is not a style, and there's no such thing as the best one. It all depends on what you like, so, taste all them. Even nowadays, with some new-age trappist beers popping up, there aren't still so many out there, so tasting all trappist beers is pretty feasible in short time (except for Westvleteren, off course).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Usually beer is shipped, by ship. This is a slow process and can get quite hot. The beers are usually not in temperature controlled environments, just in a container. The heat causes chemical reactions in the beer, making the beer's flavours and aromas change. The temp rise (day) and drop (night) also causes the beer to "age" quicker.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes, this process hurts all beers. You can do a simple test. Take 2 cans of beer, put the first in the fridge and leave it there for the week. The second you put in a sunny spot in the house during the day and in the fridge at night. Taste the beers after one week.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here in Belgium where the majority of 'true' (certificated "Authentic Trappist Product") Trappist breweries are located (6 out of 11), the common answer is the almost mythical Westvleteren 12. It is notoriously hard to acquire. One has to register by phone to get a date and hour. You can only reserve 2 crates (42 euros each) and this at most once every 60 days per phone number and car. I drank it once and it was very very good. I however like blonde beers more and prefer Orval, which has the additional benefit of actually being readily available. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In Dutch the names mean double and triple, they originated at the Belgian Westmalle abbey brewery where the double was a strong brown ale. Their tripel was the name they gave to their strongest beer, a blonde pale ale.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These beers quickly became popular and were imitated worldwide as were their names. The convention now is as following, a dubbel is a strong (6%-8% abv) dark ale, a tripel is a strong pale ale in the style of Westmalle tripel (9.5%). A quadrupel is an ale stronger than a tripel (+10%) but beyond that there is no real agreement on what it should be. Westvleteren 12 is an example of a quadrupel.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Color tends to come primarily from the malt bill used (darker roasted malts lending darker color to a beer).  In the case of Belgian beers, a "candi" sugar (derived from beets) may used as an additive, and different styles use different types of candi sugars.  For dubbels in particular, the candi is a darker variety, made with a (more) substantial dose of molasses, which would darken the beer further.  A tripel uses a candi with less molasses.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It seems like it just is like that without a very specific reason. Trappists are often Belgian-style (Tripels and Dubbels) beers and Belgium has a very rich beer culture. Most of Trappist monasteries are in Belgium France and Spain and those countries do not really have a long-lasting beer tradition. There are also numerous monasteries in US but the beer tradition/culture there is not extremely old. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;note&lt;/em&gt; I don't want to judge on different beer regions and I am just speaking of the  history and not present times, but I think it is fair to say that some regions beer culture is not as old as others.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trappists"&gt;Trappists&lt;/a&gt; are members of a Roman Catholic religious order. Trappists follow a rule of St. Benedict stating that they should "live by the work of their hands", which means many Trappist monasteries sell goods for income. The order has no particular prohibition against alcohol, so producing beer is an entirely reasonable profession for the monks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The order is centuries old, and originated in France. However, many of the French breweries were destroyed during the French revolution (and later, the world wars). Fortunately for us today, the monasteries in the beer-loving Belgium survived (or in cases like that of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochefort_Abbey"&gt;Rochefort Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, were restored).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Today, the "Authentic Trappist Product" logo, which defines a "real" Trappist beer, is owned by the International Trappist Association, an organization founded in 1997. The founding members include six abbeys from Belgium, one from the Netherlands, and one from Germany (which doesn't produce beer). It is only in very recent years that the ITA has expanded to recognize breweries aside from the original 7, the first "new" one being Stift Engelszell from Austria in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As the craft beer revolution pushes forward, I'd say we're likely to see more monasteries start their own beer production and apply for the logo. But right now, it's still mostly the original Belgians.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The explication to your question is multi-faceted and not so easy to understand if one is neither Roman Catholic nor understanding of the nuances of religious life (Trappist). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trappists" rel="nofollow"&gt;Trappists&lt;/a&gt; were founded in 1664 as a branch of the Benedictine Order at the La Trappe Abbey. The abbot of La Trappe has a greater authority of jurisdiction than the other trappist abbots. Under canon law this is permitted because La Trappe is the motherhouse of the Trappist Order. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The history of the Trappist Foundation in 1997 is of a totally different perspective. Originally only La Trappe Abbey could grant the title of the label to those &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trappist_beer" rel="nofollow"&gt;Trappist breweries&lt;/a&gt; which could safeguard the integrity of the Order. All other monasteries which could not or would not abide to the conditions to be met, would not be granted the Trappist Label. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Since 2012, four other Trappist monasteries have been added to the list, including St. Joseph's Abbey in Massachusetts, United States.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The three basic rules for granting the label are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The beer must be brewed within the monastery, by the monks or at least under the supervision of the monks.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The making of ales should be of a secondary importance to the monastery and should be seen as a witness of monastic life.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Any profits from the brewery are to be use to help sustain the monks in their life of prayer. Any extra income is to be given to some sort of charity.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There seems to be no other Trappist Abbeys that were producing beer at the time the label was founded. Since abbeys are independent of one another, sources of revenue are not limited to the brewing of ales. Some abbeys made vestments, while other distilled products such as kirsch, as was the case at Fontgombault Abbey from 1849-1905. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontgombault_Abbey" rel="nofollow"&gt;Fontgombault Abbey (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Why do you want to have Belgium Trappist beers or ales shipped from all that distance?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I live in BC and visit Bevmo several times a year in Bellingham, Washington. There are 10 Bevmo outlets in the State of Washington. They carry Belgium Trappist beer and ales. If a particular store does not have the variety on location, they will order it for you from another branch. This can be done online! I would only order internationally if the particular variety could not be purchased in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is the link to &lt;a href="http://shop.bevmo.com/search?w=belgium%20trappist" rel="nofollow"&gt;Bevmo.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think Westvleteren will not really be possible. It is already very hard to get them here in belgium. One has to register by phone to get a date and hour. You can only reserve 2 crates (42 euros each) and this at most once every 60 days per phone number and car. It is very rare for them to even sell it somewhere other than the brewery.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;1) While largely the same (make wort, ferment, bottle/keg) the two beers you list are made by different companies. Therefore, you can assume they will at least claim they have proprietary brewing methods. There is a reason why people try cloning beers with some successes but mostly fails.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;2) Most definitely just look at &lt;a href="http://beerrecipes.org/showrecipe.php?recipeid=1241" rel="nofollow"&gt;This Westvleteren 12 Clone Recipe and instruction&lt;/a&gt;* compared to &lt;a href="http://www.homebrewtalk.com/showthread.php?t=227735" rel="nofollow"&gt;This Rochefort Trappistes 10 Clone Recipe&lt;/a&gt;**.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;3) If you want to learn about the subtleties in beer and what types of hops/yeast/adjunct additions/etc influence beer and their flavors - pick a topic and branch out. There are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;SO MANY THINGS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that can change the flavor of a beer for better and for worse. There are courses and schools to help (google local beer eductaion)... Or, if you aren't sure where to start look at sites like &lt;a href="https://www.cicerone.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cicerone Certidications (think Wine Sommelier&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Beer Judge Certification Program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;*Information taken from first link&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;12.5 lbs Dingemann's Belgian Pilsner
					2.00 lbs Dingemann's Belgian Pale
					0.10 lbs Belgian Debittered Black
					0.15 lbs Belgian Special B
					3.00 lbs D-180 Candi Syrup (The Candi Syrup, Inc. D-180 syrup NOT the D2 syrup from darkcandi. Only the D-180 will produce an authentic Westy 12)
					8.0 gallons (filtered)
					Brewers Gold 1.00oz 60 min
					Hersbrucker 1.00oz 30 min
					Styrian Goldings 1.00oz 15 min
					White Labs WL530 &amp;amp; Westmalle strain (2.0 liter starter)
					1 cap of servomyces
					2 tsp gypsum

					Adding 2 liters of yeast is clearly incorrect. We couldn't contact the author of the recipe so here is the recommended yeast from another site.

					Wyeast 3787 and White Labs WLP 530 (both Westmalle Strains) should be added right away

					Wyeast 1388 (Duvel) and White Labs 550 (Le Chouffe) should be added on day 3

					Wyeast 3787 and White Labs WLP 530 (both Westmalle Strains) should be added right away

					Wyeast 1388 (Duvel) and White Labs 550 (Le Chouffe) should be added on day 3
					&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Additional Instructions
					Primary Ferment: 7 days
					Secondary Ferment: Until FG is reached&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer Profile
					Original Gravity: 1.090
					Final Gravity: 1.012
					Alcohol by Vol: 10.21%

					&lt;p&gt;THE MASH AND BOIL:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Use 2 tsp Gypsum in mash water. Initial protein rest at 138F for 30 minutes. Low decoction saccharification at 152F 30 minutes. High decoction saccharification at 156F for 30 minutes. 90 minute boil. 1 cap of Servomyces 10 minutes before flameout. Add 3 lbs D-180 Candi Syrup, Inc Belgian style candi yrup 3 minutes prior to flame-out. Note: you will not get the flavor of a true Westvleteren 12 unless you use this particular syrup. It is out of this world!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;FERMENTATION:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Chill wort to 65F. Pitch yeast starter. Let rise to 83F over 5 days and bottom heat until gravity is 1.018, (can be up to 2 weeks). Agitate if necessary to invigorate yeast. Decant to glass secondary. Let ferment for 2 more weeks in glass at 65-70F. Move to cooler rack location and let ferment 8 more weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;BOTTLING:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Create a fresh stir-plate 2 liter yeast pitch using high quality Pils wort. Decant to 500ml. Boil 152 grams dextrose with 1 pint water. Cool and add to bottling fermenter. Decant ale to bottling fermenter and pitch yeast. Stir well then stir well again :) Bottle leaving 1 inch from top of long neck. Let prime for 3 weeks at 78-80F. Move to cellar temps and let chill for 6 months at 55-60F. Drink after 6 months to 1 year.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Additional information:
					Pitch yeast at 68, let rise to 73, when fermentation is near complete, rack to secondary, cold condition for 6+ weeks, repitch yeast and add sugar and bottle condition.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is what I know about Rochefort 10 and some notes regarding this recipe:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Pilsner and belgian caramel malts are the grains used (according to BLAM and Sean Paxton). CaraVienne and CaraMunich are two possible belgian caramel malt choices. They only use one belgian caramel malt but which one they use is a secret so I figured it would be best to use a little of each (Sean Paxton does the same in his clone).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Carafa III is used mainly for some color (the candi syrup isn't dark enough alone) and for some aroma and body and flavor stability.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;It isn't possible to get the real light and dark candy sugar used by Rochefort and I feel that D2 and amber candi syrup are the highest quality and closest we can get.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Sugars are reportedly 20% of the fermentables (as they are in my recipe)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Rochefort says they use wheat starch (used to be corn) which should add some dryness and some head retention and body. Sean Paxton says it is about 5% of the fermentables (as it is my recipe).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Sean Paxton claims they use 3 step mash is used with a protein rest at 122 and a saccharification rest in the "mid-low 150s". 153 seemed to be a good number in the mid-low 150s.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;While Rochefort likely doesn't use a decoction mash, I've found that decoction mashes give better efficiency, better flavor, and better fementability for a minimal amount of additional effort.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The bittering hops are the "traditional belgian hops". I'm guessing Styrian Goldings. The flavor hops are a German hop. I'm guessing Hallertauer Hersbrucker. The hops are fairly subtle in this beer so those guesses are likely close enough if they aren't correct.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Rochefort centrifuges and bottles rather quickly but since most homebrewers don't have access to a centrifuge, 6 weeks of cold conditioning should suffice.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;A starter should be used, but should be slightly under-pitched in order to get the yeast to produce the desire esters.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Still not sure on the amount of flavor hops vs bittering hops but IBUs should be 27 according to BLAM.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;I'm tempted to pitch colder at 65 and let rise to 80 as I do with Westmalle yeast but I'm not sure if that will work with Rochefort yeast or if I'll get horrible fusel alcohols. For now, I'll try 68-73 as Rochefort does.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Rochefort ferments beers on top of older beers. I wonder if this is possible to replicate by starting with pitching into just 1/4 of the wort and adding an additional 1/4 more wort each day for three days. Probably not worth experimenting with this on the first attempt but might help with attenuation.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the different formatting- the recipes came from different sites with different standards.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Aside from the exclusiveness of the whole thing, there are reasons that Trappist beers aren't all shipped across the pond, and then across an entire continent.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While I don't doubt the abilities of the brewmasters to make an excellent, viable product, beer simply doesn't survive trans-atlantic voyages too terribly well - this was, as the story goes, the reason for the rise of the IPA. Heat/cold cycles, excess motion, and all of the horrors of transporting beer over long distances have incredibly deleterious effects on the quality.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;@Arthur D and @Ken Graham are spot-on, and I would add to what they say; trust that the brewery knows best, in this case. You're on the west coast? There are some great monastic beers available from the Abbey of New Clairveaux (sp?), and you might be able to get Spencer occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But, really... why not take a world beer trip? I heartily recommend Belgium. The beer is second to none.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;How long in advance do you need to order Westvleteren?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It seems you need to place an order in at least 60 days in advance of the time of pick up at the abbey.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The abbey is located at &lt;a href="https://www.google.be/maps/place/Brouwerij+de+Sint-Sixtusabdij+van+Westvleteren/@50.8952882,2.7208762,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x47dcc3e2684acd47:0x3f51f505680e26ce!8m2!3d50.8956974!4d2.7199924" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Brouwerij de Sint-Sixtusabdij van Westvleteren, Donkerstraat 12, 8640 Vleteren, Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. But be warned: the abbey is not easy to find. When coming from Brussels, the recommended way of travel is by car, which will take an hour and a half. Traveling by bus is doable, but not recommended. You will find yourself taking connection to connection that could possibly rack up to about a nine-hour journey.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Here’s the tricky part: if you are interested in buying this special beer, it is exclusive to the abbey and is only sold at two official sale points – the abbey and the visitor’s center. In order to get your hands on some of the world’s best beer is truly a delicate process. To acquire some Westvleteren, you must call the &lt;strong&gt;‘beer phone’&lt;/strong&gt; and place a reservation 60 days ahead of time. The phone line tends to be busy with 85,000 calls coming in every hour. Once you finally get to talk to an individual at the brewery, you will give your license plate number and set up a date and time in which you can pick up your order drive-thru style.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;While these methods may seem extreme, the monks are ultimately striving to eliminate commercial and illegal resales. There should be no pubs or bars supplying Westvleteren, and if they are, that means it’s considered a ‘gray market item.’ If you really can’t wait the 60 days, the abbey also owns a café and visitor’s center called In de Vrede, just across from the brewery, where beer can be bought on the premises to drink right away. - &lt;a href="https://theculturetrip.com/europe/belgium/articles/westvleteren-belgiums-most-secretive-brewery/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Westvleteren, Belgium's Most Secretive Brewery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Customers are limited to one case per person (per license plate) per 60 days. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;beer phone&lt;/strong&gt; for the Abbey of Saint Sixtus is &lt;strong&gt;(+32) (0)70-21-00-45&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sintsixtus.be/trial/bier-reserveren/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Bierverkoop Trappist Westvleteren&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nota Bene:&lt;/strong&gt; "The Westvleteren Beer Sale page only mentions that you cannot place another order earlier than 60 days after your previous one. It does not give any information about how long in advance the first order may be made." – &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/users/4742/altbier-is-not-old-beer"&gt;Altbier is not Old Beer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To be safer than sorry, I would still place an order in 60 days prior to pick up, unless the first purchase can be verified to be obtained earlier than that!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In addition to Ken's answer, you can also visit the abbey's gift shop at their restaurant. They usually have cardboard sixpacks for sale of one of the three varieties. There is a per person limit of 1 sixpack per day, which may or may not always be perfectly adhered to. The B&amp;amp;B we stayed at last time told us to make a couple of trips to the gift store in different clothes...&lt;/p&gt;
