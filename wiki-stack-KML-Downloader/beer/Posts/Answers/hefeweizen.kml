					&lt;p&gt;A proper hefeweizen is an unfiltered beer. The yeast and other sediment that would be filtered out for other brews is left in. These particles tend to accumulate on the bottom of the bottle during storage.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;By swirling the the beer in the bottle you're suspending that yeast and sediment so it can be poured into your glass. This is what gives hefeweizens their fruity (banana?) flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Generally you won't find coriander or other spices added to hefeweizen beers, due to the traditional &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinheitsgebot"&gt;beer purity law&lt;/a&gt;.  However, one famous exception is Gose: &lt;a href="http://www.germanbeerguide.co.uk/gose.html"&gt;http://www.germanbeerguide.co.uk/gose.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure whether by Hefeweizen, you mean German white beer? or any white beer?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am no beer expert, but in Belgium, the famous Hoegaarden does use coriander as a spice for the beer, it gives that imitation-hoppy flavor. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoegaarden_Brewery" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoegaarden_Brewery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Is "because local people want to buy it" too glib? Where there's demand there is (or should be) supply. If the Italian versions of German style beers are anything like their British counterparts there will be a flavour difference (just as there is between the different beers that are produced within Germany) but the brewers will tend to (in their own unique fashion) try to be as true to the original style as possible. As this depends on the availability and quality of raw materials there will always be a difference, but that is true even within Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In total:
					1) because people like it.
					2) not consistently but probably slightly more variation than in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Where did you read this? I am unfamiliar with Dunkle Hefe exactly, but this is true for wooden casks. 
					Typically a wooden cask is served with gravity or with a hand pump to lift from a cellar. There is an opening in the top that draws air in to equalise the pressure. This air will reduce the shelf life to 3 days.
					A "Donkey Pump" on the common sankey keg is similar. The beer will spoil quite fast.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is probably because it is so close to Austria and Germany and because the cold climate is excellent for brewing such beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To add to Leo's answer... Northern Italy is very much associated with Austro-Bavarian heritage. The province of South Tyrol is predominantly German speaking, and Trento is just south of that province. In addition, Weissbier is to Bavaria/Munich as Pretzels are to Philadelphia or Pizza is to New York.... Hmmm maybe that pretzels analogy was a bad idea  since they are a German thing. Oh well, I think you get the point. You've got German people in Northern Italy making German beer. I would trust any Hefeweizen from Trentino over Blue Moon, that's for sure. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This gels with what I've heard of Hefe's in general.  The recommendation to store the keg upside down is definitely yeast-centric, when you flip the keg to tap it it'll stir the yeast up again... which you want.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The 3 day thing is a little more puzzling.  Wheat beers in general are a style that should be had as fresh as possible, but 3 days is definitely pushing it.  Most bars will try to finish a keg of a fresh wheat beer in 2 weeks or less, if memory serves.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From reading the Google automated translation of that PDF you're referencing, that sounds like a sales/marketing document.  The way I'm taking the information is that the document is selection criteria for starting accounts with Erdinger to sell the beer at your bar.  A lot of the document seems like quality control steps like making sure the draft system is setup correctly and properly balanced, making sure the lines get cleaned at appropriate intervals, and the 3 day thing for assuring max freshness.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From a consumer standpoint:&lt;/strong&gt;  It'll last more than 3 days, you can take however long you want if it's on CO2, but for best flavor for a wheat beer you probably want to drink it within a month or 2...probably a bit longer if it's been refrigerated.&lt;/p&gt;
