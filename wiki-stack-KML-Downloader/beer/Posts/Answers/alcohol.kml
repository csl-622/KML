					&lt;p&gt;Eating will absorb some of the alcohol. Drinking on an empty stomach means the alcohol can go directly to the blood stream and the effects of the alcohol will happen faster. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So if you have food in you, especially breads, it will rather slow the process of getting drunk.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Of course you could eat four loaves of bread a slam a bottle of liquor in less then a minute and it won't help you there. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your liver processes alcohol at a fixed rate (what that rate is depends on your tolerance, current liver function, what medications you are taking, and some genetics). So eating some food, particularly foods that absorb fluids like bread, will slow down the rate of alcohol absorption into your bloodstream, allowing your liver more time to metabolize the alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So for a fixed amount of alcohol, drinking on a full stomach will make you FEEL less drunk because you spread out the alcohol absorption over time so your liver has more time to metabolize it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, you can still saturate your livers ability to metabolize alcohol by ingesting high volumes of alcohol and the absorptive ability of the food in your stomach is limited (unless you vomit it out) so it is FAR from reliable technique to drink but avoid becoming intoxicated or hungover since you are still absorbing all the ingested alcohol, just over a slightly longer period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Prices for rare or unique items are usually nearly meaningless numbers. What an item fetched at auction last week may have no bearing on what you might be able to buy it for today (possibly it would be literally priceless), and no bearing on what it might sell for tomorrow if it went to auction again. That said, a 1947 Cheval-Blanc last sold at auction in 2010 for &lt;a href="http://newyorkwineevents.com/top-5-expensive-bottles-wine-ever-sold" rel="noreferrer"&gt;£192,000&lt;/a&gt;. Who knows what Thomas Jefferson's Chateau Lafite 1787 would sell for if it came up for auction now (it sold in 1985 for &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/7589516/10-of-the-worlds-most-expensive-bottles-of-wine.html?image=8" rel="noreferrer"&gt;$160,000&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you restrict it to something you can actually buy now at retail, I think it would be tough to beat the 50 year old Balvenie (~&lt;a href="http://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/18354/balvenie-50-year-old" rel="noreferrer"&gt;£30,000&lt;/a&gt;) or 50 year old Macallan Lalique (~&lt;a href="http://www.wine-searcher.com/find/the+macallan+lalique+50+old+single+malt+scotch+whisky+speyside+highlands+scotland/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;£50,000&lt;/a&gt; if available?), but prices will be highly retailer dependent.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Novelty bar drinks will probably be more expensive by volume, if anybody actually pays for them... but if you disqualify &lt;em&gt;Diamond Is Forever&lt;/em&gt; from the Ritz-Carlton in Tokyo (&lt;a href="https://financesonline.com/9-most-expensive-cocktails-in-the-world-diamond-sparkled-champagne-or-martini/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;$22,600&lt;/a&gt;) since you're paying for a $16,000 diamond inside the drink itself, and also disqualify drinks with any precious materials other than the liquids themselves (e.g. &lt;em&gt;The Gigi&lt;/em&gt; from Gigi's at Mayfair for &lt;a href="http://secretldn.com/2016/10/5-londons-shockingly-expensive-cocktails/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;£8,888&lt;/a&gt; gets you a bit of gold leaf) and further disqualify "profits go to charity"-type drinks (you can taste the Macallan Cire Perdue¹ for &lt;a href="http://robbreport.com/Wine-Spirits-Cigars/The-64000-Scotch" rel="noreferrer"&gt;$64,000&lt;/a&gt; at the £10 bar (lol) of Montage Beverly Hills hotel), you're probably left with whatever made-for-publicity drink currently holds the record. That might be  &lt;em&gt;Salvatore's Legacy&lt;/em&gt; at &lt;a href="http://secretldn.com/2016/10/5-londons-shockingly-expensive-cocktails/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;£5,500&lt;/a&gt; from Playboy Club in Mayfair... but at this point, does it really matter? The prices would seem to just be part of the gimmick and a way of keeping score.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To try to answer the "why" part of the question explicitly, a price is only reflective of value to the extent that both a buyer and a seller can agree to transact at it. A ticket price only indicates willingness on a seller's part, and shouldn't be taken as evidence that it can in fact "command" that price. That said, while production costs (including storage, wastage, and opportunity costs) are a big reason why older wines and spirits tend to cost more, at the top end, rarity and perceived prestige will also play a big part. At auctions, though, most of it will come down to a few people with money who all want something of which only one exists. It's similar to how a &lt;em&gt;print&lt;/em&gt; of what to my admittedly philistine eyes looks like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhein_II" rel="noreferrer"&gt;a boring photograph of a not-particularly-pretty section of river&lt;/a&gt; can sell for millions.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;1: the Cire Perdue bottle itself was disqualified at the outset for being cheaper per liter than the wines and also not available at retail.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarena_cherry" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Amarena cherry&lt;/a&gt; was developed by Gennaro Fabbri and is a particular bitter cherry. Fabbri mixes them with a sort of jam and makes syrups with them.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The sensation is like the maraschino cherry, but more soft, enveloping and a bit less of sugar in it...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I found it perfect in all iced tea cocktail, to give them a twist, also good with pretty everything involving bayleys or similar creamy alcoholic
					&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarena_cherry" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;reference here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mtnero.com/amarena-cherries/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; may be of interest too.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;+1 for the Fabbri Amarena suggestion.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another alternative is brandy (or other spirit) soaked cherries, they are &lt;a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/07/brandied-cocktail-cherries-variations-on-maraschino-cherries-recipe.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;relatively easy to make&lt;/a&gt; which allows you to control what kind of spirits, how much sugar, what kind of cherries, etc.  If you not willing/able to make them, they are also available from retailers, eg &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00P1P25PW" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You seem to be asking two questions, I'll try to answer both although a lot of this is conjecture:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Why are spirits in India poured in multiples of 30ml?&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is likely due to 30ml being easy to both measure out and to drink. 30 ml is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_glass#Sizes" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;pretty standard world-wide&lt;/a&gt; as a small or single measure, and multiplying a small measure (rather than have, say, 30ml followed by 50ml) makes things easy. 20ish g of pure alcohol (large peg) or 10g (small peg) is right in line with many countries' "standard drink"s (e.g. the UK "unit" is 8g, but a typical drink has between &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_alcohol" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;1 and 3 units&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Conceivably, the "peg" might be a semi-standardization of an old northern Indian unit of mass called the &lt;em&gt;chhatank&lt;/em&gt;, which appears to correspond roughly to 60g, but I think that's more likely a coincidence. 4 of them made up a &lt;em&gt;pao&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;pau&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;pav&lt;/em&gt; - but that's almost certainly a red herring and unconnected.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Where and when did this sense of the word &lt;em&gt;peg&lt;/em&gt; come from?&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Likely after and as a consequence of the British Raj. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;OED&lt;/a&gt;'s sense 12 of &lt;em&gt;peg&lt;/em&gt; is&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;colloq. (&lt;em&gt;orig.&lt;/em&gt; Anglo-Indian). &lt;em&gt;Originally: a drink of brandy and soda water. Later more generally: a (usually alcoholic) drink, esp. of spirits; a measure of spirits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The first usage they have is from John Camden Hotten's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dictionary_of_Modern_Slang,_Cant,_and_Vulgar_Words" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Dictionary of Modern Slang, Cant, and Vulgar Words&lt;/a&gt;. All the 19th Century quotations they have seem to refer the mixture of a spirit and something sparkling, mostly soda water. The only clearly Indian quotation they have is from 2003 and refers to the 30ml measure, but they're entirely lacking in quotations between 1939 and 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It seems possible that in turn this usage came from OED's sense 2b, which has quotations going back to 1617:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any of a set of pins fixed at intervals in a drinking vessel to indicate the quantity each drinker is to drink. Now&lt;/em&gt; hist.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But that connection is not made explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The question is very broad - A lot of the answer would depend on a more specific geographical location and/or a narrower time-window.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For example in France, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavern" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Taverns&lt;/a&gt; and inns (not restaurants) were the only places for common people to eat-out all of the way up until the late 18th century, according to the wiki. This would seem to make them THE hot-spot in that region throughout that time...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's certainly popular in medieval arts to make an omage to taverns and inns in creative works:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;1.) &lt;a href="http://www.larsdatter.com/taverns.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Paintings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;2.) Many poems of the time: &lt;a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Archpoet" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Archpoet&lt;/a&gt; wishes to die in a tavern in his "Confession". See also: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trouble_at_a_Tavern" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Trafferth mewn Tafarn&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://archive.org/stream/dafyddapgwilympo00dafyuoft/dafyddapgwilympo00dafyuoft_djvu.txt" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Dafydd ap Gwilym&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;3.) There are likely more &lt;a href="http://www.medievalists.net/2014/11/medieval-drinking-song/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;drinking songs&lt;/a&gt; from the Middle Ages than one could ever hope to discover and research in a lifetime...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Given the popularity of alcohol in general, all of this would suggest that drinking establishments have been happening places before, during, and after the Middle Ages... Prob in Europe, and everywhere else... ;P&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;All fruit when crushed or rotten will have naturally occurring alcohol. As long as there is sugar, yeast and water alcohol will happen. Most commercially purchased fruit juice has a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_beverage" rel="noreferrer"&gt;small amount of alcohol&lt;/a&gt; in it when you purchase it. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Low-alcoholic beverage[edit]
					  Sparkling cider, sodas, and juices naturally contain trace amounts or no alcohol. Some fresh orange juices are above the UK 'alcohol free' limit of 0.05% ABV, as are some yogurts and rye bread.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Ethanol distillation is used to separate alcoholic beverages into what are advertised as non-alcoholic beverages and spirits; distilled wine produces low alcohol wine and brandy (from brandywine, derived from Dutch brandewijn, "burning wine"),&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_beverage" rel="noreferrer"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; distilled beer may be used to produce low-alcohol beer and whisky.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;However alcoholic beverages cannot be further purified to 0.00% alcohol by volume by distillation. In fact, most beverages labeled non-alcoholic contain 0.5% ABV as it is more profitable than distilling it to 0.05% ABV often found in products sold by companies specializing in non-alcoholic beverages.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are many stories about deer, bear and other wild animals getting drunk on apples that have fallen and rotted on the ground. &lt;a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/11/151121-animals-science-drunk-insects-mammals-drinking/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Do animals get drunk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;“I’ve watched white-tailed deer eating fermented apples in orchards," Moore says. They get pretty “sleepy,” even “stumble-y.” It’s a common observation in apple-growing regions, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But I think you want to know if there are naturally occurring drinks other than eating a bunch of rotten fruit and there are only a couple of that I have heard of and the one you mention in your question was one and the other was naturally occurring mead which happens when water gets into a beehive with honey in the comb. &lt;a href="https://honeybeesuite.com/uncapped-honey-fermenting-in-the-comb/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Honey fermenting in the comb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;To produce honey, bees collect nectar from flowers and add enzymes from their honey stomachs. Once the mixture is stored in cells, the bees fan it with their wings until it dehydrates to a moisture content of about 16 to 18.5 percent. If the moisture content is higher than that, the bees simply won’t cap it. If cold weather arrives before the honey is capped, it will sit open in the hive and may eventually ferment.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I’m not familiar with pisco but whatever ingredient is cooking the egg(citrus juice I’d think) needs to be separate when shaking and added afterwords.  It may be already in the glass that you pour the cocktail but finding a bartender that makes them often enough will usually be willing to show you the steps.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Several suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;On a fresh egg, remove the chalazae, the ropey bit in the white (it anchors the yolk);&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Use either pasteurized egg whites or powdered egg whites;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Add ice only after the mixture has become foamy and voluminous;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Use a finer mesh strainer (if bits are getting through your shaker strainer).&lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Chicago bartender here. Try adding your egg whites to one half of the shaker and your pisco and citrus to the other. Dry shake first. Then add ice and shake for 20 seconds. Double strain through a mesh strainer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rakia&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Rakija&lt;/strong&gt; is the collective term for &lt;strong&gt;fruit brandy&lt;/strong&gt; popular in the Balkans. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakia" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; has this to say about Rakija:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Rakia or Rakija is the collective term for fruit brandy popular in the Balkans. The alcohol content of rakia is normally 40% ABV, but home-produced rakia can be stronger (typically 50%). &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Common flavours are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slivovitz" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;šljivovica&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, produced from plums, kajsija, produced from apricots, or grozdova/lozova in Bulgaria (raki rrushi in Albania), or "lozovača" or "komovica" in Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia and Bosnia produced from grapes, the same as "Zivania" in Cyprus. Fruits less commonly used are peaches, apples, pears, cherries, figs, blackberries, and quince. Similar spirits are produced in Romania, Moldova, Poland, Ukraine, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Russia and the Caucasus. In Albania, rakia is most commonly made out of grapes in mild climate regions and out of plums (and sometimes out of mulberry or walnuts) in colder climate areas. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Plum and grape rakia are sometimes mixed with other ingredients, such as herbs, honey, sour cherries and walnuts, after distillation. A popular home-made variant in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Macedonia, and Serbia is rakia produced from mixed fruits. In the Istrian and Dalmatian regions of Croatia, rakija tends to be home-made exclusively from grapes, where the drink is also known locally as trapa or grappa (the latter name also being used in Italy). &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Normally, rakia is colorless, unless herbs or other ingredients are added. Some types of rakia are kept in wooden barrels (oak or mulberry) for extra aroma and a golden color. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;It is supposed to be drunk from special small glasses which hold from 30 to 50 ml.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Greek ouzo (from grape) and tsipouro (from pomace), Turkish rakı (from sun dried grapes) and arak in Lebanon and Levant region differ from rakia as they are redistilled with some herbs (commonly anise). Some tsipouro in Greece is made without anise in the same manner as pomace rakia (or pomace brandy). "Boğma rakı" in Turkey (common name of the domestic raki which is produced at homes and villages) is similar to rakia in the Balkans. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slivovitz" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Slivovitz&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_brandy" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;fruit brandy&lt;/a&gt; made from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damson" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;damson&lt;/a&gt; plums. The primary producers are Bosnia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Serbia and Slovakia. The usual proof of private-produced slivovice is over 50% of alcohol in the final product, commercially available mass-produced slivovice is proofed less. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Šljivovica is the national drink of Serbia in domestic production for centuries, and plum is the national fruit. Šljivovica has a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO). Plum and its products are of great importance to Serbs and are a part of numerous traditional customs. A Serbian meal usually starts or ends with plum products and Šljivovica is served as an apéritif. A saying goes that the best place to build a house is where a plum tree grows the best. Traditionally, Šljivovica (commonly referred to as "rakija") is connected to a Serbian culture as a drink used at all important rites of passage (birth, baptism, military service, marriage, death, etc.). It is used in the Serbian Orthodox patron saint celebration, slava. It is used in numerous folk remedies, and is given certain degree of respect above all other alcoholic drinks. The fertile region of Šumadija in central Serbia is particularly known for its plums and Šljivovica. In 2004, over 400 000 litres of Šljivovica was produced in Serbia.  &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here follows a few sources on how to make some Raki (Brandy).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journeymacedonia.com/rakija/making-rakija/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Making Rakija – The Basics&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Making rakija involves five main stages: harvest, preparation for fermentation, fermentation, distillation and aging &amp;amp; storage.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://windowtobulgaria.blogspot.com/2013/01/how-to-make-rakia.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;How to Make Rakia (Ракия)&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;ol&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select a Fruit. Rakia is typically made from fruit, so the first thing you need to do is choose one. Grape and plum rakias are the two most traditional varieties, but Bulgarians make rakia out of whatever is readily available and cheap – apple, pear, peach, apricot, and cherry rakias are all popular in certain parts of the country. Other varieties are made less frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pick and Gather the Fruit. Once you’ve selected a fruit, you have to “pick” it. Picking a fruit is often as simple as going to the market and buying as much of it as you need. But grape vines and fruit trees grow aplenty in Bulgaria, and most Bulgarians hand-pick the fruit they use to make rakia. With grapes, this means waiting until the right time in fall and bringing together friends and family for a grape-picking weekend. With other fruits, Bulgarians typically wait until the fruit is slightly overripe and then they shake the fruit out of the tree by vigorously shaking the branches and/or swatting at the branches with a long stick. Only the fruit ripe enough to make rakia falls out of the tree, after which it is all collected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make Juice. Once you’ve collected the fruit, you mash it up, make juice, and dump it into a large barrel. The mashing process can be done by machine or the old-fashioned way – by foot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measure the Sugar Content and Add Dissolved Sugar as Necessary. After the fruit has been mashed into juice, you measure the concentration of sugar in the juice with a saccharometer (захаромер). An ideal reading for making rakia is 23°, and a sugary water solution of approximately three pounds of sugar to every gallon of water should be added to the mash until the ideal sugar level is attained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stir the Juice and Allow it to Ferment. The fruit juice will settle to the bottom, and the fruit skins will harden and float to the top of the mash. To make sure the juice ferments, it is necessary to push the fruit skins down and stir the juice once daily. The amount of time for proper fermentation depends in large part on the weather, but fermentation generally takes around three weeks. You might notice that thousands upon thousands of fruit flies are attracted to the mash. Don’t fret. Believe it or not, fruit flies assist greatly in the fermentation process. As a matter of fact, the Bulgarian word for fruit fly, муха-винарка, takes its name from the Bulgarian word for wine, вино, and literally translates to wine fly. Not surprisingly, more than one Bulgarian friend of mine hopes someday to be reincarnated as a муха-винарка.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distill the Fermented Juice. Distillation day is one of the most enjoyable days of the entire process; it is the day when rakia begins to flow. There isn’t much to the distillation process, although some people do a double distillation while others only do a single distillation. Regardless, the initial steps are the same. The mash is dumped into a still, which is sealed with a flour mixture to insure the still is air tight, and then a fire is lit under the still and distillation commences. Then you sit and wait. It typically takes about an hour before the first alcohol fumes begin to separate from the mash. This steam then makes its way through the sealed pipes before working its way through a cooling condenser and emerging as rakia. As the alcohol collects, measurements are taken. When I made rakia, we did a double distillation. On the first distillation, our rakia started with an alcohol content of around 60%, and we stopped the distillation when the alcohol content dropped to 20%. We then emptied and cleaned the still, dumped the alcohol we had produced into the still, and started a second distillation. On the second distillation, our rakia started with an alcohol content of 75%, and we stopped the distillation when the alcohol content dropped to 40%. The finished product was a potent 124 proof rakia (62% alcohol).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xh7DH.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xh7DH.jpg" alt="Distillation unit"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ol start="7"&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age the Rakia. Once distillation is complete, your rakia is ready to drink. Some Bulgarians do nothing more, but most prefer to age and dilute their rakia to make it more pleasurable to drink. Rakia may be diluted by adding distilled water until the desired alcohol percentage is attained. It may be aged as long and in whatever manner you see fit, but most Bulgarians only age their rakia long enough to give it some color and a little taste. We aged our rakia in oak chips for a month and added distilled water to make it more drinkable at 90 proof (45% alcohol).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enjoy. Of course, the final step of the rakia making process is drinking it and sharing it with friends. Хайде наздраве! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I once tried some quince brandy &lt;a href="http://www.theliquorbarn.com/srpska-trojka-quince-brandy-750ml/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;(Srpska Trojka Quince Brandy)&lt;/a&gt; and although I found it a great drink, I also admit that because of the quince one has to have an acquired taste for it. Plum Rakia would definitely be my next one to try. &lt;/p&gt;
