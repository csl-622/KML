					&lt;p&gt;Prohibition was an Era in American history from 1920-1933 - and - it failed miserably. If anything, it made alcohol more popular.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Prohibition, in general, also means to prohibit something via law or religion though. The religious aspect is the only case that one can see prohibition working. ::Insert Mormonism/Islamic religion/et cetera here::&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_alcohol_prohibition" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Currently the list of Countries that have prohibition (and their counties) are:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; Afghanistan
					 Bangladesh
					 Brunei
					 Iran
					 Indonesia (prohibition in small business shops)
					 India (prohibition in the states of Kerala, Gujarat, Bihar, Nagaland, Manipur and the union territory of Lakshwadeep)
					 Libya
					 Kuwait
					 Maldives (excluding non-Muslims)
					 Mauritania
					 Pakistan (excluding non-Muslims)
					 Saudi Arabia
					 Sudan
					 Somalia
					 United Arab Emirates (prohibition in the emirate of Sharjah)
					 Yemen
					&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most of these are in Muslim-majority countries while India only prohibits alcohol in some states and their residing counties.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am interchanging county and country because &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-other-countries-that-have-states-also-have-counties-and-districts" rel="noreferrer"&gt;not all countries that have counties or states that have been divided into counties.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As with almost anything that becomes banned or illegal it causes the substance to increase in cost greatly since the acquisition of the substance requires illegal acts from manufacturing to distribution. Therefore, no prohibition does not generally work in stopping consumption but it does result in many other legal issues.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt; In Gujarat , A state of India There is prohibition since 1958 which has never worked and also created lots of illegal troubles as well as loss of taxes on booze. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Bombay State had prohibition between 1948 and 1950, and again from 1958.[17] Gujarat has a sumptuary law in force that proscribes the manufacture, storage, sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages. The legislation has been in force since 1 May 1960 when Bombay State was bifurcated into the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat. The Bombay Prohibition Act, 1949 is still in force in Gujarat state, however there is licensing regime in Maharashtra with granting licenses to vendors and traders. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Gujarat is the only Indian state with a death penalty for the manufacture and sale of homemade liquor that results in fatalities. The legislation is titled the Bombay Prohibition (Gujarat Amendment) Bill, 2009.[18] The legislation was prompted by numerous deaths resulting from the consumption of methyl alcohol.[19]&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But the result is that people dies due to homemade liqueurs every month and every year. You can check this. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;in a world where people follow laws and do not attempt to profit from illegal activities, Prohibition of a product would 'in theory' work.  however, that is not the reality we live in.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Historical evidence shows us that with a vast majority of prohibition of a product, the demand for said product does not immediately drop, but the supply does.   This makes the product very profitable for those entities that are able to obtain said product and then distribute it for basically any price they so choose.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Thus for the example with alcohol prohibition in the 1920's US, crime families immediately started to acquire or make product, distribute it, and even open facilities to sell and consume.  This took out all middle men and gave them full and complete control of the entire supply chain, and thus allowed for them to keep maximum profits.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another example in the US, is how the war on drugs has done little to stop the demand for drug in the country and only made the cartels more money.&lt;/p&gt;
