					&lt;p&gt;Even though you think this is a issue with certain types of mead during aging, I can't help but think you are just dealing with contamination that is turning some batches foul. I've never read of any type of mead that WORSENS with proper aging. So either you just don't like dry mead (maybe try carbonating it?) or you have contamination ruining your mead independent of what type it is. Alas, it is hard to find commercial meads to see what you actually like. Chaucers is wretched. I've seen some Scandinavian meads (like &lt;a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/19218/135533/?ba=Wobbly" rel="nofollow"&gt;Vikings Blod&lt;/a&gt;) but they are pricey ($30+ for a bottle) so I've only tried a few. Maybe there is a mead brewers gathering near where you live? &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://myplace.frontier.com/~mshapiro_42/meadmanl.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Meadery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Your Mead was great when bottled, but the taste has changed
					  dramatically for the worse after only a few weeks? What you probably
					  have is a vinegar infection. Smell the Mead and look for any hint of
					  an aspirin or vinegar smell. If you catch it right away, you can often
					  save a batch by treating it with sulfite tablets, but the odds are not
					  very good. You can only stop further damage, not reverse what has
					  already occurred. Worse, if a vinegar infection got into your Mead,
					  it's undoubtedly living in your brewing system somewhere. Go after it
					  with a vengeance. Sanitize everything post haste, maybe even throwing
					  out all of your siphon hoses (acetobacteria loves to hide there). Make
					  sure there is a good seal on your air-locks. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;If you have done all of this, and your Mead still tastes terrible
					  after six months, try again. Examine all of your sanitation
					  procedures, especially bottle washing. Make sure that any herbs or
					  raisins or whatever that you might have added were not a source of
					  bacterial infection. Most foul tastes are the result either of
					  sterilizer contamination or bacterial infection. If you used an exotic
					  ingredient, such as papaya peel, maybe you should try a new recipe.
					  Maybe aging will solve the problem, maybe not. At a meadmakers
					  gathering back in 1986 there was a Mead that everyone agreed had been
					  the meanest they had ever tasted just the year before, but which had
					  improved dramatically after a year of aging.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Oh, and another possibility that might slowly degrade your taste, from the same site:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;You don't want the Mead to sit on the sediment for too long,
					  especially in a warm climate, because the spent yeast will begin to
					  feed on the sediment (a process called autolysis), and this will give
					  your Mead an unpleasant taste. If your Mead takes a long time to
					  ferment, rack it every month or so if it keeps throwing sediment.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In this case you make be bottling too soon, or adding too much sediment when you do bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest determinants in how well a mead or beer or wine will age is oxidation. The only time that oxygen is beneficial is when your must or wort (IDK the currect term for unfermented mead) has cooled and you are ready to pitch the yeast. Oxygen at this point will help the yeast to multiply. But when the liquid is hot prior to cooling, and after fermentation is complete, you should be careful to minimize the amount of oxygen you are adding to it. Always stir gently and avoid splashing when racking and bottling. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You use the word "skunking" in the title. True skunking (as opposed to staling or oxidation) is caused by a chemical reaction between hop extract and light. If you are adding hops to any meads, be sure to protect the bottles from light by storing them in a dark place, preferably in a box. Sunlight and florescent lights are particularly harmful.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Bread yeast is very close to brewers yeast.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is a mead recipe you can search-up: "Joes ancient orange mead", which does specify using bread yeast, rather than specific mead yeast.  Many home brewers make this with good levels of success.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Failing that, you can grow naturally-occurring yeast from the skins of fresh and dried fruits (e.g.: grapes). We used to do this as kids to carbonate ginger beer soft drink (aka: soda). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, your mead is fine if you haven't opened it.  Normally, commercial meaderies bottle in dark bottles (or something other than clear) which keep out the UV light.  I doubt that the temperature was much of an issue.  You should be able to chill your mead and enjoy it.  FWIW, I'd drink it out of a wine glass made for white wine rather than the skull of an enemy.  You'll be able to pick up on the subtleties of the mead this way, while the other might be more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My experience is that mead tends to go flat rather quickly &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; opening. I do not know how long the average bottle of mead stays in good condition before being opened, but some of the mead we drank from some of our local meaderies has been flat when being opened (all use clear bottles), but the fact that we stored the mead in our pantry tells us that the color of the bottle did not play into the fact that they went so flat. No sunlight ever reaches our pantry!  When flat, it is still drinkable, but is not at all appealing. Most people would not drink it. Why this happened I do not know. Perhaps temperature had something to do with it or simply it was a bad batch of mead?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The mead was chilled before being consumed.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Mead, like other types of wine, come in a variety of &lt;a href="http://shop.bevmo.com/search?w=Mead" rel="nofollow"&gt;colored bottles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Aging mead is perfectly acceptable. The biggest risk you have is that it will be oxidized and that some of the flavors could become muted. For example, in my homebrewed meads spices like anise will go away after a year. If you have a traditional straight mead that may not be an issue. I would assume professionally bottled mead would have minimal oxygen to spoil the mead.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A good primer about mead is in the bjcp 2015 mead guidlines. There is a primer at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/docs/2015_Guidelines_Mead.pdf" rel="nofollow" title="2015 BJCP Mead Styles"&gt;2015 BJCP Mead Guidlines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In that it states: "Alcohol flavors (if present) should be smooth and wellaged, not harsh, hot, or solventy. Very light oxidation may be present, depending on age, but an excessive molasses, sherry like or papery character should be avoided. Aging and conditioning generally smooth out flavors and create a more elegant, blended, rounded product. All flavors tend to become more 
					subtle over time, and can deteriorate with extended 
					aging."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you want to make a small amount of mead, you can follow those directions, but you will need modern equipment. A carboy and an airlock is basically all you need. Actually, you will probably need two. One to ferment and one to age the mead. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Mead is pretty simple to make. Water, honey and some yeast. Most people get filtered water. Then boil it with the honey to sterilize the honey (especially important if you use unfiltered). Then let it cool off and add yeast. I would also add yeast nutrients since honey lacks the nutrients to really work good. Also, use wine yeast since it's adapted to higher alcohol levels than beer yeast.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Once it's cooled off you pour it in a fermentation vessel. You will need some space between the level of the fermenting mead and the airlock for foaming. After fermentation has stopped, then you need to have it almost to the top of the bottle so there is no oxidation occurring.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am not sure about the sun exposure, in fact I would keep it out of the sun unless you need to warm it up, which is what they may have been trying to do in ancient times.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It will look something like this during fermentation (this is someone's picture of some cider fermenting):&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is what it looks like aging and clearing:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are using honey, water and yeast. Then the answer is NO. But alcohol is a poisonous substance if not used properly. You cannot make it strong enough to "poison" you in the traditional sense. Could you poison yourself by drinking too much of it, sure it's possible. But, there are no by-products from the fermentation process that would "poison" you. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Let me see if I can answer your questions. I have years of experience with making beer, wine and mead...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;No, leave the apples alone until fermentation is done.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;No, the alcohol will stop any rotting. Your mead might be spoiled from another source of contamination (remember good sanitation) but as long as there is alcohol the apples won't rot.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;It is advisable to move the mead from the fermentation vessel to a second one for aging. Mead is more like wine than beer and will benefit from some aging and clarification in a second vessel. This would involve leaving the fruit behind.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;While it's not 100% necessary to add sulfites (campden tablets) to you mead, it will preserve and protect it from oxidation. Like wine they should be added when you move it to the second vessel for aging.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;
