					&lt;p&gt;There appears to be no consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;After scanning hundreds of Google results for &lt;code&gt;polewka piwna&lt;/code&gt; (and &lt;code&gt;polewka beer&lt;/code&gt;) using Google Translate to read pages in Polish, I found, as you did, most recipes refer generically to "beer (not dark)."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I found several pages getting as specific as "Lager."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I found a single blog post whose author used a blueberry-flavored ale.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Therefore I'd conclude it's a matter of taste—maybe not a matter at all, but if so, up to experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Let me start off by saying that I am an Italian-American, not a drop of Polish blood in me; so I'm not really in sync with Polish traditions.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With that said, most of the recipes I'm seeing make it clear that you want to use a light beer, so obviously you're not gonna want to use a stout or porter here (though I'd be curious how it tastes; my friend swears by Guinness in his beef stew). With that said, most lagers or pilsners (a type of lager) should be fine for your purposes (of course I would avoid macro-lagers like Bud, Coors, and Miller because they are awful). &lt;a href="http://www.anchorbrewing.com/beer/anchor_steam" rel="nofollow"&gt;Anchor Steam Beer&lt;/a&gt; might be interesting in the soup as it packs a lot of flavor for a lager type beer in my opinion. For authenticity, you're likely gonna want to use a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilsner" rel="nofollow"&gt;pilsner&lt;/a&gt;. You have to realize, as the Wikipedia article points out, that until the 1840's or so, most beer from the area was top-fermented (like ales; modern pilsners and lagers are bottom-fermented) and the taste varied widely, so I'm not sure how a beer 300-500 years ago would have tasted. The closest you'll likely be able to go back is the 1840's; in which case I'd give Pilsner Urquell a shot as it's the first pilsner beer in the world. Victory makes a mean pilsner (&lt;a href="http://www.victorybeer.com/beers/braumeister-pils/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Braumeister Pils&lt;/a&gt;) too. Unfortunately it's draft only, so if you have a growler handy you can use it; otherwise best look elsewhere. Of course you can probably get away with most &lt;a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/style/40/?start=50" rel="nofollow"&gt;Czech pilsners&lt;/a&gt;. I can't figure out why Beer Advocate doesn't have a sorting option so that you can sort based upon the rating, but I digress. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You have to remember that beer was much different 300-500 years ago. Yes, there are some breweries such as  Dogfish Head who recreate ancient ales. Yards has also recreated three brews based upon George Washington's, Thomas Jefferson's, and Ben Franklin's (my favorite of the three) original recipes. But for the most part, beer has evolved in the last 300-500 years; even in the case of the Dogfish Head and Yards brews I mentioned since they have to be pasteurized and must meet the (stupid) FDA standards here in the US. If you've ever tried raw milk, you know how much pasteurization changes the flavor; same goes for juice and beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With that said, lets go back to the whole top-fermenting thing. You might want to give a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%A4tzer" rel="nofollow"&gt;grätzer&lt;/a&gt; a try as well. It's an ancient Polish beer which has been recently making a comeback. There's a &lt;a href="http://sfbrewersguild.org/blog/historic-gratzer-beer-recreated-by-team-of-san-francisco-brewers" rel="nofollow"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; going on right now to recreate the brew. However, since the brew is so (recently) new, I'm not sure how available it is; you'll likely have to make a trip to San Francisco to get some. There are others too, such as those offered by &lt;a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/24134/81644/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Westbrook Brewing Co.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/piwo-grodziskie--gratzer-ale/157564/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Schlossbrauerei Au&lt;/a&gt;. But I'm not sure how readily available these are either. You're probably better off brewing this once yourself until this beer is pulled off the "endangered beers" list. &lt;a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/08/beer-styles-grodziski-gratzer-polish-smoked-wheat-beer-history.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Yards has also experimented&lt;/a&gt; with this style, but again, it's not readily available (see &lt;a href="http://www.yardsbrewing.com/retired." rel="nofollow"&gt;Tadeusz Kosciuszko Smoked Pol&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.europeanbeerguide.net/polbrew.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;This website&lt;/a&gt; may also be of use to you; it outlines a history of Polish beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Supposedly washing your hair with it has some nice effects,
					and people have found other creative uses: 
					&lt;a href="http://en.rocketnews24.com/2013/12/27/how-to-make-good-use-of-flat-leftover-beer-from-your-christmas-party/" rel="nofollow"&gt;How to make good use of flat, leftover beer from your Christmas party&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, if it is only a few days old and has been in the fridge, it's unlikely that it's done much more than go completely flat, so any use that doesn't require it to be carbonated would be fitting. -- I'd go for the bread.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You could use it to make steak and ale pie, this works particularly well with darker beers. Although you don't need much - about 1 cup / 220ml.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In my experience,  many recipes that call for beer either work fine with flat beer or call for it that way.  Examples include chili, fish poached in beer,  and some stews.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would be reluctant to use it for bread unless the recipe calls for a "normal" amount of yeast,  though.  Some recipes seem to rely on the yeast in the beer and others add bread yeast,  so check in order to avoid baking a hockey puck. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is for conventional bread.  If you're making a quick bread that uses baking soda,  you don't need help from the beer for rising.  (Thanks waxeagle.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Making it into a marinade for steaks would work.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Depending on the type of beer, I would also consider using it for boiling sausages/bratwurst with it.  Though I find that the darker beers are the best for this.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'd definitely say cook with it as others have mentioned. You're really just trying to impart &lt;strong&gt;some&lt;/strong&gt; of the beer flavors into the food; you don't really need a fresh beer to do that as carbonation doesn't affect the flavor, it affects the mouth-feel. The carbonation from a fresh beer would be lost in cooking anyway. If it's only been 2 days, it probably hasn't spoiled, so you're fine. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer bred is always an option. I also saw someone else on here mention &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/312/what-type-of-beer-should-be-used-in-making-beer-soup-polewka-piwna/318#318"&gt;Polish Beer Soup&lt;/a&gt;.
					Beer-battered fish is another option. I could go on and on with recipes though. The &lt;a href="http://brooklynbrewshop.com/themash/category/cookingwithbeer/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Brooklyn Brew Shop&lt;/a&gt; has a lot of interesting ones that I've never seen before, such as french toast (might be good with a chocolate stout or other dessert stout) and beer braised greens. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Household uses include trapping insects in your home, washing hair, fertilizing plants, cleaning wood furniture, &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2011/08/09/14-household-uses-for-beer/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;etc&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Go for lower alcohol and less hoppy.  Alcoholic drinks on meat can give great flavor, but the alcohol has a tendency to dry out said meat.  Some form of malty session beer would be great to cook with, if you had any near you.  Rauchbier would probably work well, since that smoke flavor would really enhance the meat, but drinking it with it might be too much.  If you do cook them this way, don't boil, just simmer for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What would probably be pretty pimp, would be to make a beer reduction with the onions and serve that on the brats.  Sauté some onions, and right after they've started to caramelize, add some of a great malty beer...maybe a Marzen... and simmer it on medium heat until it starts to thicken up and make a syrupy sauce that sticks to the onions.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When cooking sweeter meats like brats or other sausages, I always use very malty beers, typically of the darker variety. Nut brown ales, dopplebock, stouts are favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Flank steak marinated in a combo of Newcastle Brown Ale, lots of red pepper flakes, garlic, lime juice, salt and pepper makes universally awesome fajita meat.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're making sauces or deglazing a pan, definitely go with the malty stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;definitily yes. you could add the beer of your choise to add some extra flavour to the sauce and enjoy the whole dish with a nice beer at the right temperature. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;for the right temperature i would refere to that:
					&lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/5/what-temperature-should-i-serve-my-beer"&gt;What temperature should I serve my beer?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;imho: you can also refine your stew with wine and drink the same one while eating.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is no culinary basis to make that generalization. The choice of beer (or wine or any other ingredient used to add depth) may be selected to enhance, balance, contrast, or even &lt;em&gt;counteract&lt;/em&gt; one of the other &lt;em&gt;ingredients&lt;/em&gt;. But that doesn't necessarily make it the beverage of choice to accompany the resulting dish. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The beer-as-an-ingredient may not even be the dominant &lt;em&gt;flavor&lt;/em&gt; of the dish. And if it &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the dominant flavor, that doesn't &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; mean "more of the same" is the best accompaniment. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For example, (I'm drawing an analogy) I might add a dry white wine to a pasta sauce to add depth or a sweeter white wine to help cut acidity. But tomato-based pasta dishes are traditionally accompanied by a &lt;em&gt;red&lt;/em&gt; wine, not &lt;em&gt;white.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These are broad generalizations, but there's nothing to say that my favorite bread recipe enhanced with a light lager must (or even preferably) be matched with a lager. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's the overall flavor of the &lt;em&gt;dish&lt;/em&gt; that determines the best accompaniment. Not the beer ingredient.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Since I can't comment yet, I need to use this answer box...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I guess you could just create the exact same dish and leave out the meat or replace it by those vegetarian replacements (quorn etc.).
					I can imagine a beer stew would be epic without the meat but with more vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I quickly looked up one of our Belgian dishes in a vegetarian way, more specific: stoverij&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Stoverij translated would be "stewed things" or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20130316_041" rel="nofollow"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is the original recipe (in Dutch).
					Try to translate it through Google translate. If you have troubles, I could help I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The old tradition is to use a sandwich with mustard and high quality beer, you'll read that :).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In my country drink made of mulled beer (usually with some spices) mixed with egg yolks beaten with sugar is quite popular. It is kind of thing you prepare when you are ill. As dessert it is considered "controversial") But you can try, some people really like it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should add that it is rather hard to make, because you need right temperature of a liquid, so that mixture thickens but yolks do not coagulate.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I used this recipe for &lt;a href="http://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/black-bean-soup-with-roasted-poblano-chiles" rel="nofollow"&gt;Black Bean Soup with Roasted Poblano Chiles&lt;/a&gt;.  It doesn't include beer as an ingredient but I chose this recipe as part of the beer/food pairing menu I put together for my parents.  I decided to pair it with Out of the Ashes (Smoked Marzen) from Fort Collins Brewery.  I poured about 1 1/2 cups of it into the soup while it was cooking.  You may not be a fan of smoked beers, but it went amazing with this soup.  The smokiness blended with the soup and did not have a strong flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Stone Brewery serves a &lt;a href="http://www.stoneworldbistro.com/bistro_menus/dinner.asp" rel="nofollow"&gt;smokey cheddar garlic soup&lt;/a&gt; at their tasting room bistro which is cooked with their Ruination IPA. The bitterness balances the salt and richness of the cheddar. I would definitely use IPA cautiously in cooking though, as the beer and alcohol will partially evaporate, causing the hop bitterness to concentrate noticably.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A great recipe that use lots of beer: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Vegetarian Pot Pie:
					2 Bottles of Stout
					Carrots, celery, onion, garlic, oil or butter, potatos (pre-baked for 30min)
					salt and pepper to taste
					2 pie shells 
					1 bag of white flower &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Brown the vegetables in a skillet over medium heat.
					Add salt and sugar to get the caramelization going. 
					Pour in the beer and bring to a boil.
					Slowly pour in and stir the white flour, 1 cup at a time, until it becomes very gloopy.
					Keep at a low simmer / boil. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Fill the pie shell with the gloopy stew, and cover the top with the 2nd pie shell. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Bake in the oven for 50 minutes. Then take it out and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Please take a step back and remember that beer may include isinglass as fining as per this wikipedia article: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism_and_beer" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism_and_beer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Going back to your question of dishes with beer that I tried, adding some beer to a crepe is good to make it taste richer. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Crepe recipe is really easy. Mix the following in a blender: 1 glass of milk, 1 egg, 1 glass of wheat flour, some oil, some beer, a bit of salt and a bit of sugar. Use a fry-pan to bake the crepes. Tomato, cheese and herbs are my favorite topping for crepes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I made beer bagels several years ago, and the beer imparted a sort of sour dough flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Guinness ice cream was also delightful - &lt;a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/guinness-ice-cream-with-dark-chocolate-honey-sauce-recipe.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/guinness-ice-cream-with-dark-chocolate-honey-sauce-recipe.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer batter onion rings also come out nicely, but I've never really tasted the beer after frying. That being said, if you are up for frying, anything that asks for a seltzer in the batter for the bubbles could probably sub in a brew.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Guinness is in a style called &lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style13.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;"Dry Irish Stout"&lt;/a&gt;, so anything on &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/162/" rel="nofollow"&gt;this list&lt;/a&gt; would probably substitute well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It sort of depends on what you felt was missing from the cake.  We could work on narrowing it down to stouts that were stronger in those flavors.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Oatmeal or milk stouts as styles would be sweeter than Guinness, some stouts might play up chocolate or coffee or roast/burnt.  Porter is a really similar style that takes well to interesting spice combinations like vanilla and anise.  Bourbon Barrel aged stouts will have a wood/vanilla/whiskey thing going on.  You could make some interesting cakes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are some stouts with cocoa in their recipes. Two that I like are &lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/youngs-double-chocolate-stout/139/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Young's Double Chocolate Stout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/sadlers-mud-city-stout/96060/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sadler's Mud City Stout&lt;/a&gt;, both available in bottles in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A saison would be the closest if you want "authenticity". This soup was usually a breakfast dish made with very weak farmhouse style ale often served to farm workers. The beers were locally brewed often by the farmers themselves. It only had about 3-4% abv so even today's commercial saisons have a bit more (5-8% abv). Sometimes kvas was used. Kvas is a light brew made from fermenting stale/dried bread (1-3% abv).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes the alcohol cooks off but the flavor is not in the alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you would not drink it then don't cook with it. The flavor of the wine will come through. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For me I do not cook with an expensive full body red as then just too much comes through.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;More about grape and just get a decent wine.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Like Chardonnay with clams you would get some oak coming through with a nicer bottle but I am not going to spend more than $12 on cooking wine.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You don't use that much. You can just use the wine you would pair with the meal. I don't drink much white so I will typically use the wine I am serving with the meal.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A pork chop with onion and peppers I will use a $4 red bottle I would drink.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another trick is if they are starting to go bad then cooking wine. But wine rarely stays around long enough to go bad at my house.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The more expensive bit is not true, but the type of wine does make a dramatic difference to the taste imparted to your food.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As an extreme example compare cooking a steak with a light white wine sauce to cooking it with a heavy Merlot.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Even within a particular grape, there are differences in how full or heavy the taste is.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So don't worry about the price (go for a cheap one) and instead think about what flavours you want to go into your food.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It all depends on what you are making and what you are drinking!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some people reach for the &lt;a href="http://www.foodandwine.com/articles/alexandra-guarnaschellis-tips-on-cooking-with-wine"&gt;cheap bottle&lt;/a&gt; that's in the door of the fridge when making a braise, where the wine will cook for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Others use the &lt;a href="http://www.winemag.com/2007/02/19/cooking-with-wine/"&gt;type of wine&lt;/a&gt; you’d serve with dinner to make the dish. Even better, unless you’re pouring something rare or expensive, buy an extra bottle and cook with it. When you’re cooking with red wine, watch out for tannins. When concentrated in reduction sauces, they can become harsh. Fortunately, proteins found in meat and dairy declaw tannins like milk does tea.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.winemag.com/2007/02/19/cooking-with-wine/"&gt;Wines contains sugars, acids, and tannins,&lt;/a&gt; and each of these will show up on the plate. Subtle characteristics, by contrast, normally disappear with cooking. To maintain balance, check your recipe for acidic ingredients like lemon juice or vinegar and cut back to make room for the acid in the wine. This is especially crucial when cooking with white wine. For delicate fish or vegetables, a dry non-oaked wine works best. If your recipe is packed with onions, carrots and tomatoes, there will be plenty of sugars in the pot, so cooking with a fuller-bodied, less dry red or white wine can integrate perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.winemag.com/2007/02/19/cooking-with-wine/"&gt;For deeper flavors,&lt;/a&gt; experiment with fortified wines like Port, Sherry, Madeira and Marsala. Michael Schachner offers some helpful tips and recipes on cooking with fortified wine in this piece.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-Wine-in-Cooking"&gt;Cook with a wine you would drink.&lt;/a&gt; Do not use a wine to cook if you would never drink it in a glass or serve it with food. •Start with a basic red or white wine. An example of a good white to cook with is Sauvignon Blanc. Try Chianti or Cabernet Sauvignon for a red.
					•Avoid using wines that are labeled "cooking wines." These wines contain a lot of salt and other additives and you would never drink them in a glass.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another option is to &lt;a href="https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/9683/how-to-make-malt-vinegar"&gt;make your own malt vinegar&lt;/a&gt;.  You can just put a piece of cheesecloth over the top (with the cap removed), or you could add a little vinegar mother, like from the bottom of a "natural" bottle of vinegar, and it will turn it to vinegar for you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Please allow me to recommend a nice red classic Italian wine called &lt;a href="http://www.gourmetsleuth.com/ingredients/detail/chianti" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Chianti&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From this &lt;a href="http://www.gourmetsleuth.com/features/wine-cheese-pairing-guide" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wine and Cheese Pairing Guide&lt;/a&gt; we can see that Chianti is paired well to the &lt;strong&gt;Pecorino Romano Cheese&lt;/strong&gt; and nuts. I know that you are using a &lt;em&gt;Columella's Caciofiore&lt;/em&gt; cheese that is "considered a sort of "ancestor" of the Roman pecorino cheese, prepared with rennet based on cardoon."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.parks.it/romanatura/Edettaglio_prodotto.php?id_prodotti=2078" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Columella's Caciofiore&lt;/a&gt; can be considered a sort of "ancestor" of the &lt;strong&gt;Roman Pecorino Cheese&lt;/strong&gt;, prepared with rennet based on cardoon. Columella talks about this cheese in his treatise "De Rustica": "It is better to curdle the milk with lamb or kid rennet, although it is also possible to curdle it with the cardoon flower or with safflower seeds or fig latex. Anyway, the best cheese is made with as less treatment as possible". (Lucio Giunio Moderato Columella, "De Rustica", 50 AD). Today, in the Roman Countryside, "native country" of the cardoon and the artichoke, some producers still use the cardoon flower as rennet and prepare raw milk pecorino cheese with an ancient taste. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Chianti red wine could be substituted with a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangiovese" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Sangiovese&lt;/a&gt; red wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the olives or spices are over powering the taste of your dish you may wish to use a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlot" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Merlot Wine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If it is a fortified wine you are after, would like to recommend a &lt;strong&gt;fortified Madeira Wine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Fortified wines, like port, sherry and Madeira, also go very well with rich cheeses. A classic match is English Stilton and port, but other blue cheeses also taste lovely alongside a glass of sweet, flavourful port. - &lt;a href="http://www.castellocheese.com/en/the-journal/2016/7/pairing-red-wine-with-cheese/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Pairing red wine with cheese&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The only answer would be an aged Madeira or Port. I think either would be an excellent accompaniment to the foods are your choosing. Make sure they are fairly old. 10+ years old at least. The older the better...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Best wine I ever had was a 1780s Madeira. Each bottle alone was over $10,000 and a glass at the restaurant was $1000. I know the restaurant owner and he let me have a taste. It was sublime! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Great question for the dessert enhancement front.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Zabaglione is generally thought as sweet, however it can also be made without sugar, using dry wine and egg yolks, thus becoming a fine sauce for fish, chicken or vegetables. It is used this way in French cuisine as well as Italian. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;In Italy chefs and home cooks often measure the ingredients for zabaglione quite casually. Six egg yolks, for example, would be combined with six egg shells of sugar and 12 of wine or liqueur. Although Marsala is most often used for zabaglione, there is no reason why other wines or liqueurs can't be substituted, depending on the final flavor desired. Italian recipes usually call for dry Marsala. If a sweet wine or liqueur is used, the amount of sugar should be substantially decreased. Grand Marnier, Sauternes, Madeira, oloroso sherry, Southern Comfort, anisette, coffee- flavored liqueurs, Amaretto or La Grande Passion, the new passion- fruit liqueur, are just a few of the possibilities. - &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/03/nyregion/food-zabaglione-an-italian-dessert.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;ZABAGLIONE, AN ITALIAN DESSERT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally, I would not use whiskey or cognac in this dessert. But this is a personal preference. I am impartial to either a blackberry wine or strawberry wine. When I say these particular wines, I mean real blackberry wine and not simply blackberry flavored wine. It makes a difference in my mind. &lt;strong&gt;All said and done whiskey can be used in zabaglione&lt;/strong&gt; and in fact here is an Italian recipe for it. The following is in Italian:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Sbattete 4 tuorli con 60 g di zucchero, versate a filo 1/2 dl di whisky e cuocete a bagnomaria, montando con una frusta. Montate 1 dl di panna e unitela allo zabaione. Per un'alternativa sprint: Zabov (0,70 litri, 8,50 e). -  &lt;a href="http://ricette.donnamoderna.com/zabaione-al-whisky" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Zabaione al whisky&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mylastsupper.com/2011/08/angela-hartnett-zabaglione-recipe/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Angela Hartnett’s zabaglione recipe&lt;/a&gt; uses whiskey, brandy and a sweet wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;How about an Irish Zabaglione recipe and once again it is in Italian: &lt;a href="http://www.irlandaonline.com/cultura/cucina/ricette/zabaione-irlandese/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Zabaione Irlandese.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Bon Appetite and Pleasant Drinks Everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchermes" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Alchermes&lt;/a&gt; could be a good hint, in Italy is used as an ingredient in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuppa_Inglese" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Zuppa inglese&lt;/a&gt;, a particular derivation of trifle ...as you are trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Just a reminder, i don't think is SO GOOD to drink it as a glass of wine, but perfect with desserts.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've seen a lot of people commenting to cook with it , which is my advice , but I haven't seen someone speaking about crepes.
					I don't know if we only do this here (france) but I've always used beer to make crepes and it's realy great. I recently thought about using strong flavored beers (like dark ones) but didn't try it yet so if you try it soon a feedback would be appreciated ! &lt;/p&gt;
