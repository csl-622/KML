					&lt;p&gt;The ideal temperature for storing beer is between 10 to 15 ˚C (50 to 59 ˚F). If you are planning to preserve your beer for several years, it is better to have an even lower temperature of about 4 to 10 ˚C (40 - 50 ˚F). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A cold cellar is ideal to preserve your beer as a humidity of about 60% - 65%. The reason being that it can affect the airtightness of the cork (or cap). Dry corks are bad for preserving beer as they will tend to break down and cause wild yiests or bacteria to enter the bottle (which would render the beer undrinkable).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And as commented by Grohlier:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Remember, light can drastically affect beer. Darker bottles can withstand more light than their green and clear counterparts. However, light is not good for beer in general, even if it is stored at the appropriate temperature. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This depends entirely on the beer. As a rule of thumb I would say that any beer which is re-fermented once bottled, can be preserved for several years. You need to be careful when preserving, but it's not unheard of to drink 35 year old beers. Often these beers are the darker, stronger ones like Westmalle or Orval. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The beer will not be bad in the sense of unsafe to drink, since no harmful pathogens grow once the beer is fully fermented. So you can certainly drink the beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, the beer may not taste good! Over time, the beer will oxidize, both from oxygen introduced during packaging, but also through the release of oxygen from compounds previously oxidized in the beer. The oxygen causes the beer to stale, producing tones of sherry, paper, cardboard. Hop aromas are muted, and hop beta acids oxidize to produce an unrefined bitterness. Other forms of staling can lead to a soap taste.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Generally, the higher the alcohol content of the beer the less you need to be concerned with the use by date. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the beer has been conditioned/pasteurized then you should store the beer as cold as possible - 2-5C is good. The biggest negative factor affecting beer storage is oxidative staling, and this proceeds 3 times faster for every 10&amp;deg;C/18&amp;deg;F increase in temperature. Inversely, each drop in temperature of the same amount causes the rate to reduce by the same 3-fold amount.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the beer is still living, then storage temperature will depend upon if the beer has fully conditioned, for example, storing at 15&amp;deg;C until the beer is conditioned and then dropping to lower temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This depends on many factors, but usually best-before date is what is states, also the date before which the full quality of the product is guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It doesn't mean you can't consume it afterwards, it just means that you can't make formal complaint about the taste or potential sickness caused by consumption of the product after that date.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The people from food industry said me, that it is general rule, that the best-before date is normally exaggerated in bottom direction, just to protect the company from potential sues. I've often drank beer much after best-before date, and as long as that date wasn't exceeded by more than a year, I haven't noticed any big difference in taste. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;StillTasty.com has the following to say with regards to beer - particularly specifying that this applies to regular or light beer from bottles or cans manufactured by major breweries:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://stilltasty.com/fooditems/index/16511"&gt;Opened Containers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Good for 1 day, refrigerated.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Tips:  &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ul&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Keep refrigerated and tightly covered.  &lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;After opening, most commercially manufactured beer will remain safe to consume if properly stored, but it will quickly become flat and lose flavor.&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ul&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://stilltasty.com/fooditems/index/16512"&gt;Unopened Containers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Good for 4-6 months, in pantry or refrigerator.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Tips:  &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ul&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;The precise answer to the question "How long does beer last?" depends to a large extent on storage conditions - store beer in cool, dark area.&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Keep beer away from direct sources of heat or light; too much exposure to light can cause beer to develop a foul taste.&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;To maximize the shelf life of beer, store beer at a temperature between 45° F and 55° F (colder than the typical room temperature, but warmer than a refrigerator) - if this is not possible, store beer in the refrigerator.&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Storage times shown are for best quality only - after that, the beer's color or flavor may change, but in most cases, it will still be safe to consume if it has been stored properly.&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;How to tell if beer is bad? If beer develops an off odor, flavor or appearance, it should be discarded for quality purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;"Best By," "Best if Used By," and "Use By" dates on commercially packaged foods sold in the United States represent the manufacturer's estimate of how long the product will remain at peak quality - in most cases, the beer will still be safe to consume after that date, as long as it has been stored properly and the package is not damaged.&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Beer made by some micro-breweries may not retain peak quality as long as beer from major breweries.&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ul&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there's not much one can do, at least using only household products.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While filling, using a counterpressure bottle filler would maximize the longevity of the beer as well as filling the beer while it's very cold, near its freezing point ~29 degrees F (so that its CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is maximally dissolved), if you have a choice in the matter (likely not).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Once opening the growler over multiple sessions, however, it's not the ineffectiveness of the seal (using a swing-top growler should do just fine) as much as it is the growing amounts of air that get sealed within.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It should still be safe, taste good is a personal opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some beers age well, high alcohol, sours, and smoke beers. Others don't age as well (hoppy beers). Plus it all depends on how the beer was stored. Out in a hot garage? Sitting in your window sill?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your question says they were opened?  I'm going to venture probably not.  You tagged this 3.2-beer, does that mean these are low alcohol session beers somewhere around 3.2% ABV?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the beers aren't moldy, best case scenario is you now have two bottles of home made malt vinegar.  Make a balsamic, have some steaks with side salads.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If they were closed or sealed in any way, they're probably fine, though depending on the style they probably won't taste great.  Low alcohol and hoppy beers don't age gracefully.  Higher alcohol or darker beers often do better with some time on them.  But either way you have to keep them away from air, namely other microbes and oxygen or else things go downhill real fast.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;All wine that you want to age for a long time should be kept at the same temperature. The difference in temperatures come when you want to serve the wine. White should be served at a lower temperature than cellar temperature. Red wine, ideally, should be served at cellar temperature. What is the ideal cellar temperature? That is open to debate, but somewhere in the low 50s Fahrenheit (about 11-12 C). Humidity should be kept constant around 75% but there is no evidence you need to keep the humidity that high. You do not want to keep it at an excessively low humidity. You are trying to make sure the corks don't dry out which can cause wine leaking around the cork. You also want as little light and vibration as possible. Think of a cave as your ideal storage facility. You can read the Wikipedia article about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_of_wine" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wine Storage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can do this just like a bottle of sparkling wine. It should keep the beer for a couple of days, but not forever. Sometimes the corks don't work great, so I would buy a &lt;a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00IFGJL0G" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Champagne bottle stopper&lt;/a&gt; like the one below 
					Don't get the one that hold onto the ridge under the bottle opening. They work great for Champagne bottles but not so good on Belgian beer bottles.

					&lt;p&gt;We've tried doing this years ago, so as for any corked drinks, it doesn't pop out or randomly pop out, but in case you're wondering how it would taste like, there's two diversions of the taste, either the taste would randomly contribute to the corkage of the wine to make it taste better.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;After opening the bottle the beer will begin to oxidize and degrade in quality, so flavor will begin to suffer shortly after opening.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Pressure will not continue to build in the bottle from fermentation, the yeast have consumed what residual sugar is present for bottle carbonation. That being said, the dissolved CO2 will remain in solution at cooler temperatures but escape rapidly as it warms, so capping while the bottle is cool and keeping the bottle cool will preserve more CO2 in solution after opening.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A recorked bottle will be most likely to drive out the cork if allowed to warm, or agitated physically.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A recorked bottle will be less likely to drive out the cork, if recorked warm, and then placed gently into cold storage.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Lastly, volumes of CO2 in Belgian beers can range wildly, but their level of CO2 is generally higher than domestic US beer, however much lower than champagne. Pressure in the bottle will react as such.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the USA you can find this type of cap at most homebrew shops. These originated in Holland but now are popular for many breweries around the world.

					&lt;p&gt;This really depends on the drink itself. Some wines are meant to keep for years. Others should be drunk immediately. Most should be drunk within 1 or 2 years. So choose your wine carefully. There are various vintage wine guides online.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, once you have chosen a wine meant for ageing, you do want a cellar (or if that is not available, a refrigerator designed for the purpose) that will be able to give you consistent:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Temperature: around 12-13 C (55 F)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Humidity: around 70 percent&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Light: keep wines out of sunlight or even bright lights&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And if the bottles have cork stoppers, they need to be stored on their side to prevent the cork drying out. This isn't an issue with screw tops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And that's pretty much it. If you don't have a cooler or cellar, keeping them in a cool, dark cupboard is still going to help...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I did a deep dive into Stack Exchange because I thought this question would've been asked before! But, it has not. That doesn't mean that the answer isn't super easy to find. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First of all, not all wines are meant to be aged. The vast majority of wines are meant to consume when you pick them up at the store. How can you tell which are which? Mainly on price (although not always the case). As the price point goes higher, these wines have been made with aging in mind and many times are unpalatable at a younger age. Red wines are meant to age longer because the tannins (the thing that gives red wine it's color) are an anti-oxidant. Some white wines like Riesling can age for decades. Champagnes can age for a long time, but because of their delicate nature and the cork and the whole CO2 pressure thing, they are harder to age. I've had some nicely aged Champagnes. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So basically, keep it in the dark and as close to freezing as possible. Some say that 55F is the best temperature, but actually the closer to freezing you get makes it keep longer. The problem is that for bottles with corks you should have a relatively high humidity so the corks don't dry out. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The myth that wines with screw caps don't age has been debunked by the Australian wine industry because the have mostly moved to screw caps and the wines age just fine if differently than bottles with corks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging_of_wine" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Aging of Wine&lt;/a&gt; from Wikipedia pretty much tells you the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;
