					&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://www.keykeg.com/en/" rel="nofollow"&gt;disposable kegs&lt;/a&gt;  that work the way you describe - with a inner pouch that is filled with beer and gas pressure is applied to the outside of that. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For draught systems that directly push the beer, there are these gasses in common use:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;air - such as with a hand-pump&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - homebrewers and short runs&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - for creamflow beers or where the beer line is longer than 50'.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;A mix of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Using air to push the beer doesn't have any immediate affect on taste. However, after a few hours the oxygen in the air will start to stale the beer, causing staling flavors, and a muted hop aroma. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Using CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to push the beer can cause the beer to have more "fizz" and in extreme cases more carbonic bite.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For long beer lines, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is used to overcome the carbonation problem with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A combination of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, typically in the ratio 75%/25% is used for Guinness and creamflow beers. When used in conjunction with a stout or creamer faucet, this has a definite affect on the flavor and appearance of the beer - bitterness is rounded out and the beer has a thicker mouthfeel. When the beer is poured, the faucet and gas pressure cascades of bubbles to form when poured in the glass, which produce a lovely thick dense head of foam on top of the glass. With this type of serving, it's key to have a relatively low amount of dissolved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or the glass will be filled with foam only.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Cask beers have very low levels of carbonation, enough that one could almost consider them to be flat. This is due to the fact that they aren't served under any pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What you're most likely to find everyday are not beers that are flat, exactly, but are very low in carbonation.   Barleywine ale is one of these styles, and though it will typically have some carbonation, it will be very little.  In the UK, real (or cask) ale is another style with very little carbonation.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The only style I can think of off the top of my head that is really and truly uncarbonated are the super high alcohol beers like Boston Beer's Samuel Adams Utopias and some of the various high-alcohol freeze-distilled* varieties.  To me, these styles have nearly as much in common with fortified wine or spirits as they do with beer, and they're not easy to find, so they're a bit of an outlier.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Distillation requires heat, so the process of freezing to concentrate alcohol in a beer isn't really technically distillation, but hey, that's what it's called, so when it Rome...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Historically beer was almost definitely still (flat) for thousands of years. Before the discovery/invention of force carbonation methods, all beer was carbonated naturally via bottle or cask conditioning. But people were brewing alcoholic beverages commonly referred to as beer in antiquity, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Edward_McGovern#Investigations_of_ancient_dyes.2C_foods.2C_beverages.2C_and_other_organics" rel="noreferrer"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; from these cultures (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiahu" rel="noreferrer"&gt;ancient China&lt;/a&gt;, Neolithic culture, etc) suggests that they were doing this in big stone and earthenware pots and jugs, which may have had no lids or loose lids. Their vessels probably could not have withstood the pressure of carbonation even if they were using wax or cork to seal the vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So if you were to brew a historical style and you wanted to be truly accurate, then you would not carbonate it. But the modern historical interpretations usually are carbonated (like &lt;a href="http://www.dogfish.com/ancientales" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Dogfish Head's ancient ales&lt;/a&gt;), because they are selling them and Westerners generally prefer them :)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is one "modern style" (e.g. &lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/catdex.php" rel="noreferrer"&gt;a style you'd find in the BJCP style guide&lt;/a&gt;), that can be served with &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gYVLHMmplRcC&amp;amp;pg=PA221&amp;amp;lpg=PA221&amp;amp;dq=oxford%20beer%20companion%20carbonation&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=MGgbsp_cV7&amp;amp;sig=34ClGqwJYwLtNhACLrhsw7Ot8Zc&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=itX_Ut-2PKPWyQG5m4DQDw&amp;amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=oxford%20beer%20companion%20carbonation&amp;amp;f=false" rel="noreferrer"&gt;no carbonation&lt;/a&gt;, namely &lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style17.php#1d" rel="noreferrer"&gt;straight (unblended) lambic&lt;/a&gt;. Several have little or low carbonation, (e.g. barleywine) mentioned in other answers. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahti" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Sahti&lt;/a&gt; also has very little carbonation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But people do still drink flat/still beer all over the world, for example there's some uncarbonated corn beers that are popular, like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicha" rel="noreferrer"&gt;chicha&lt;/a&gt; in Latin America (&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/dining/09beer.html?pagewanted=1&amp;amp;_r=1&amp;amp;sq=dogfish&amp;amp;st=cse&amp;amp;scp=1" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Dogfish Head made a Chicha inspired beer&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umqombothi" rel="noreferrer"&gt;umqombothi&lt;/a&gt; in South Africa. There are other names for similar beers in other regions. These are typically homebrewed.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Technically, yes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The actual answer has more to do with yeast content than carbonation.  Unfiltered beers like real ale have much more yeast in suspension, and yeast has a tendency to make you gassy when digested.  Lager in general has very little yeast due to the long, cold, aging process.  I believe commercial examples are filtered as well.  In general most commercial beers are filtered, or at least have had the yeast killed off somehow, which mitigates the effect.  Real ale's major selling points are that it's unpasteurized and unfiltered, and is refermented in the cask...so it's basically got way more yeast and way more active yeast than other kinds of beer.  And then cask ales are served from a tap at the front near the bottom...near the yeast.  Basically the perfect storm of fart-induction.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I home brew ales and stouts all the time and have never carbonated or even bottled it. I have never missed the bubbles or the constant burping. In fact, I am enjoying a glass of English Bitter right now. Tasty and refreshing. Five gallons of beer so that I can dip a jug whenever I want, and no messing with bottles. By the time you finish the 2nd one, you will not miss the carbonation.&lt;/p&gt;
