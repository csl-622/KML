					&lt;p&gt;Prices for rare or unique items are usually nearly meaningless numbers. What an item fetched at auction last week may have no bearing on what you might be able to buy it for today (possibly it would be literally priceless), and no bearing on what it might sell for tomorrow if it went to auction again. That said, a 1947 Cheval-Blanc last sold at auction in 2010 for &lt;a href="http://newyorkwineevents.com/top-5-expensive-bottles-wine-ever-sold" rel="noreferrer"&gt;£192,000&lt;/a&gt;. Who knows what Thomas Jefferson's Chateau Lafite 1787 would sell for if it came up for auction now (it sold in 1985 for &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/7589516/10-of-the-worlds-most-expensive-bottles-of-wine.html?image=8" rel="noreferrer"&gt;$160,000&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you restrict it to something you can actually buy now at retail, I think it would be tough to beat the 50 year old Balvenie (~&lt;a href="http://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/18354/balvenie-50-year-old" rel="noreferrer"&gt;£30,000&lt;/a&gt;) or 50 year old Macallan Lalique (~&lt;a href="http://www.wine-searcher.com/find/the+macallan+lalique+50+old+single+malt+scotch+whisky+speyside+highlands+scotland/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;£50,000&lt;/a&gt; if available?), but prices will be highly retailer dependent.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Novelty bar drinks will probably be more expensive by volume, if anybody actually pays for them... but if you disqualify &lt;em&gt;Diamond Is Forever&lt;/em&gt; from the Ritz-Carlton in Tokyo (&lt;a href="https://financesonline.com/9-most-expensive-cocktails-in-the-world-diamond-sparkled-champagne-or-martini/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;$22,600&lt;/a&gt;) since you're paying for a $16,000 diamond inside the drink itself, and also disqualify drinks with any precious materials other than the liquids themselves (e.g. &lt;em&gt;The Gigi&lt;/em&gt; from Gigi's at Mayfair for &lt;a href="http://secretldn.com/2016/10/5-londons-shockingly-expensive-cocktails/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;£8,888&lt;/a&gt; gets you a bit of gold leaf) and further disqualify "profits go to charity"-type drinks (you can taste the Macallan Cire Perdue¹ for &lt;a href="http://robbreport.com/Wine-Spirits-Cigars/The-64000-Scotch" rel="noreferrer"&gt;$64,000&lt;/a&gt; at the £10 bar (lol) of Montage Beverly Hills hotel), you're probably left with whatever made-for-publicity drink currently holds the record. That might be  &lt;em&gt;Salvatore's Legacy&lt;/em&gt; at &lt;a href="http://secretldn.com/2016/10/5-londons-shockingly-expensive-cocktails/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;£5,500&lt;/a&gt; from Playboy Club in Mayfair... but at this point, does it really matter? The prices would seem to just be part of the gimmick and a way of keeping score.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To try to answer the "why" part of the question explicitly, a price is only reflective of value to the extent that both a buyer and a seller can agree to transact at it. A ticket price only indicates willingness on a seller's part, and shouldn't be taken as evidence that it can in fact "command" that price. That said, while production costs (including storage, wastage, and opportunity costs) are a big reason why older wines and spirits tend to cost more, at the top end, rarity and perceived prestige will also play a big part. At auctions, though, most of it will come down to a few people with money who all want something of which only one exists. It's similar to how a &lt;em&gt;print&lt;/em&gt; of what to my admittedly philistine eyes looks like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhein_II" rel="noreferrer"&gt;a boring photograph of a not-particularly-pretty section of river&lt;/a&gt; can sell for millions.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;1: the Cire Perdue bottle itself was disqualified at the outset for being cheaper per liter than the wines and also not available at retail.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Going to go with Guinness- $16 million in 2007. Several websites state that  Guinness spent $60 million dollars on there 80th anniversary (birthday) in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Moving back to beer and safer ground, Guinness celebrated their 80th birthday in style with an estimated $16 million spend on a TV advert.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;That figure is slightly surprising when you appreciate that this advert doesn’t contain any celebrity endorsers. What it does include, however, is a rather precarious domino system of items through an Argentinean village leading up to a pint of Guinness made up of books.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;It hurts just trying to work out how many takes it would have required. - &lt;a href="http://livingroom-uk.com/four-tvs-expensive-adverts" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Four of TV’s Most Expensive Adverts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.therichest.com/rich-list/the-biggest/the-10-most-expensive-tv-commercials-ever-made/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The 10 Most Expensive TV Commercials Ever Made&lt;/a&gt; has this to say about the TV advertisement:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;When celebrating your birthday, you are allowed to be a little extravagant, right? Well, Guinness took its 80th birthday celebration to a whole new level; by spending $16 million on a commercial. With the slogan “Good things happen to those who wait,” the commercial that was shot in Argentina shows a whole village waiting for the revelation of Guinness beer after thousands of objects together with dominoes have to knock each other down one by one. Some of the objects in the sequence include cars, tires, padlocks, suitcases, crutches, chairs, and almost anything that can be found in a village. The commercial does not feature any celebrities, but the concept, the setup, and the use of all the resources is what must have pushed up the cost to $16 million.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Guinness commercial can be seen here on YouTube: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAQiuutkxdU" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Guinness Dominos Commercial - Tipping Point.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Let's start with what are Nomex corks and what are natural corks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomex" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Nomex&lt;/a&gt; is a registered trademark for flame-resistant meta-aramid material developed in the early 1960s by DuPont and first marketed in 1967.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Nomex and related aramid polymers are related to nylon, but have aromatic backbones, and hence are more rigid and more durable. Nomex is the premier example of a meta variant of the aramids (Kevlar is a para aramid). Unlike Kevlar, Nomex cannot align during filament formation and has poorer strength. However, it has excellent thermal, chemical, and radiation resistance for a polymer material.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"Nomex corks" for wine do not exist. In fact "Nomex cork" material is used as a &lt;a href="http://www.auburn-mfg.com/gasket-material-guide.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;gasket material&lt;/a&gt; for engines and the like. &lt;strong&gt;I believe you are thinking of rubber corks.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Natural cork comes from the outer bark of the cork tree.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Cork is produced from the sponge like material taken from cork oak trees, also known as Quercus Suber. Cork oak trees are grown primarily in Portugal. Cork started to become the sealing material of choice in the late 1600’s when it became possible to create glass wine bottles with an almost uniform shape and design. It took until the late 1700’s to create easy to use corkscrews for the wine lover or tavern owner. At that point in history, cork replaced glass wine stoppers, which while they worked well, glass stoppers were not easy to remove without breaking the wine bottle. The pairing of the cork and wine bottle ushered fine wine into the modern age, as from that point forward, wine had the ability to age and evolve in the bottle. Interestingly cork and fine wine share another commonality. The cork, oak tree needs to be at least 25 years old before the material used to create the cork can be harvested. This is similar to the age of vines in many of the world’s best wine regions. While grape vines are harvested every year, cork trees are only able to be harvested once every nine years. - &lt;a href="http://www.thewinecellarinsider.com/wine-topics/wine-education-articles/wine-corks-everything-need-know-wine-corks/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wine Corks Everything You Need to Know About Wine Corks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternative wine closures or corks&lt;/strong&gt; can be seen here and many are known as rubber corks and plastic corks: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Alternative wine closures are substitute closures used in the wine industry for sealing wine bottles in place of traditional cork closures. The emergence of these alternatives has grown in response to quality control efforts by winemakers to protect against "cork taint" caused by the presence of the chemical trichloroanisole (TCA). - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_wine_closure" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Alternative wine closures (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are pros and cons to using of all types of corks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The problems with synthetic corks is the lack of a perfect seal. In turn that allows more unwanted air into the bottle, causing the wine to oxidize. Worse, many of the synthetic corks have been known to impart a slight rubber or chemical smell, damaging the wine. Beherns and Hitchcock, a producer of Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa California was one of the early proponents of plastic corks. Most of the wines bottled using those synthetic corks have not developed well. Many of those wines are defective. However, today, they have improved since their initial creation. Because the plastic corks allow air to integrate at a faster pace than normal corks, some winemakers actually prefer it. In fact, that has become part of the selling point as the corks can be ordered to allow for a more or less rapid transmission of air into the wine, based on the tightness of seal.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Wine corks do however have problems, the major issue being infection with TCA, which causes what is known by wine collectors and others in the wine business as Corked Wine. Corked bottles of wine remains a serious problem in the wine industry as many people think that it effects between 5% to 10% of all wine undrinkable.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The old saying that nothing lasts forever is especially true with wine. When a wine cork degrades, so does the wine, due to additional exposure to air, which in turn causes premature oxidization. Before that happens, for rare and expensive bottles, it might be possible to replace your old cork with a new wine cork. This is something you cannot do at home on your own. For more on replacing your wine cork, &lt;a href="http://www.thewinecellarinsider.com/wine-topics/wine-educational-questions/recorked-or-reconditioned-bottles-explained" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Everything you need to know about Re-Corking wine bottles.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Corks have been the undisputed choice to seal wine bottles for hundreds of years. But with all the alternative enclosures available these days, &lt;em&gt;by 2016, it is estimated that only 70% of all wine bottles today are sealed with natural corks.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Still, at the end of day, it is unlikely corks will be replaced as the sealer of choice for the best wines.&lt;/strong&gt; In part, there is the romance and tradition of removing the cork, coupled with that special popping sound that lets you know, you are about to drink a wine and that is something technology cannot improve on. - &lt;a href="http://www.thewinecellarinsider.com/wine-topics/wine-education-articles/wine-corks-everything-need-know-wine-corks/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wine Corks Everything You Need to Know About Wine Corks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Although natural cork is more eco-friendly, they are s slightly more expensive than their counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is no "right" price. It's whatever the market will demand. If you can find the price that bottles are selling on the open market, then that's the price people are willing to pay. Too bad there's no eBay for beer and wine!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The only way to know the price for sure is to sell it and find out the price at that time, preferably at auction.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The only way to price a rare item like this &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; selling it is to mark it to market. You need to find a number of comparable bottles of special edition beers with similar collectors' markets and use the prices of those bottles to calculate the current price of that bottle. The more similar the comparable bottles are in terms of time since sale, qualities of the beer (style, ABV etc.), number of bottles produced and size of "following" or number of collectors, the closer your price will be to a realistic price. If it were really valuable an auction house such as Sotheby's or Christie's could be employed to do the calculations for you as they are quite involved. Note that marking to market only gives a guideline price at a moment in time as prices can fluctuate wildly in collectables markets. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The basis of this pricing model is the pricing of any liquid commodity or financial instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Duty-Free shops are placed in such a way that travelers must leave the country of origin (sale). Australia is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Duty-free shops (or stores) are retail outlets that are exempt from the payment of certain local or national taxes and duties, on the requirement that the goods sold will be sold to travelers who will take them out of the country. Which products can be sold duty-free vary by jurisdiction, as well as how they can be sold, and the process of calculating the duty or refunding the duty component. - &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty-free_shop" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Duty-free shop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/118045/42525"&gt;J. Caron&lt;/a&gt; makes this statement about the Sydney airport:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Don’t remember the exact layout in Sydney, but in most airports (if not all), you can’t get to the duty-free shops without going through immigration (where applicable) and security, which you generally won’t be able to do without a boarding pass for a flight.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The shop will also often require to see the boarding pass, and in some places will make a distinction between people travelling domestic or international. In some countries like the US, as there is not necessarily a separation between domestic and international travellers, and you can exit the departures area at will, they will not give you the goods right away, but deliver them during the actual aircraft boarding.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;In some airports (especially in the EU), duty-free shops will actually sell duty-free when they can (you are actually leaving the country, or in the case of the EU, leave the EU customs union), and make a discount equivalent to duty-free for other cases.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have seen duty-free sales of liquor and other items sold on in-flight only on some international flights.&lt;/p&gt;
