					&lt;p&gt;There are some other Cistercian monasteries like the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbsp_Nh_bPAhXIcT4KHcRtA84QFggfMAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newclairvaux.org%2F&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNELoGbExIFi0qOZcfSfeTtaXvpZMg" rel="nofollow"&gt;Abbey of New Clairvaux&lt;/a&gt;, which has a vineyard and produces wine. Also, Sierra Nevada produces the Ovila beers in cooperation with the abbey.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the abbey can be considered a Trappist monastery, but that the beer is not sanctioned by the International Trappist Association, and is therefore not a 'trappist beer'.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/18786736" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ampleforth Abbey&lt;/a&gt; is a Benedictine monastery that produces beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And you may be interested in &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24049424?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" rel="nofollow"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; which describes, as the title puts it, making wine under Buddhist supervision.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Monastic alcohol production goes back a long ways. Probably as old as the Catholic church. In fact, I think that at one time in Europe you had to be part of the church just to produce alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This page has 11 different beer producers, which are known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trappist_beer" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Trappist monasteries&lt;/a&gt; mostly in France and Belgium&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here are a list of 24 &lt;a href="http://journal.beer/abbey-beer/beer-and-monastic-orders/benedictine-brewers-in-germany/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Benedictine breweries&lt;/a&gt; in Germany&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This page lists many &lt;a href="http://us.france.fr/en/information/monastic-wines" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;monastic wineries&lt;/a&gt; which are mostly in Burgundy and Champagne&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Remember it was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dom_P%C3%A9rignon" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Dom Perignon&lt;/a&gt; that "invented" Champagne&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9n%C3%A9dictine" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Bénédictine&lt;/a&gt; is a liquor made in a Abbey in Normandy&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The list goes on... search on Benedictine, Trappist, Cistercians will yield a ton of results.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So to sum it up, most of these monastic drinks are for sale to the public. That's how they raise money to keep things going, so yes you can buy most of these somewhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From what I can find I'm not sure I can give an exact answer to the main question (when J&amp;amp;B started using screw caps) but I think I found something that matches your description, from 1972:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.maxliquor.com/product-p/j-and-b-scotch-1972-quart.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.maxliquor.com/product-p/j-and-b-scotch-1972-quart.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/czc3o.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/czc3o.jpg" alt="J&amp;amp;B Scotch Bottle, 1972"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell the label matches the picture on the page you linked and appears to have a screw-cap.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, on the website you linked to, there are example bottles from &lt;a href="https://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/j-and-b/j-and-b-rare-75cl-1960s-whisky/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;the 60's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/j-and-b/j-and-b-1970s-whisky/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;the 70's&lt;/a&gt;.  Interestingly though, the 70's bottle has a different label than the one above from 1972.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Given all of this, I would assume the switch to screw caps happened in the late 60's or early 70's and that the bottle your friend obtained is likely from the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A distillery is just a building at the end of a day, the flavor of a whiskey comes from the ingredients and equipment used inside it. In whiskey making the equipment used makes a big difference in the end product, here's a non-exhaustive list:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Stills: stills are used to concentrate alcohol, the shape and material used for stills make a great difference in the end flavor of the whiskey&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Barrels: whiskey is aged for years, generally in barrels of some kind. The material used can make a big difference, for instance there's charred barrels, used wine or port barrels. The whiskey will take flavors from the barrel as it ages&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The ingredients that are used in whiskey making likewise make a big difference:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Grain: Barley, Rye, Wheat and Corn are all used in whiskey making, and each give whiskey a very different character&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Peat: peat smoke is widely used in scottish whiskey making, the amount and type of peat used gives the end product more or less flavor &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Yeast: the strain of yeast used in the fermentation will have an impact on flavor&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There's also conditions to consider like the temperature and length of the initial fermentation, still heat, etc. There's the number of times that a whiskey is distilled, triple distillation would give a very different character than double distilling. These are all under control and change the end product. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So a distiller with a single set of equipment using the same grain could make many different characters of whiskey by varying the process and types of barrel used. If they have different stills and use different grains a single distillery could make a very wide variety of whiskeys. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for this specific case, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanton%27s" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Blanton&lt;/a&gt; is a brand which is named after Albert Blanton, one of the founders of the Buffalo Trace distillery and who worked there for more than 5 decades. The same company (Sazerac) owns several distilleries and produces many different brands. For all I know they do just pour standard Buffalo Trace into the bottles and market it as something else, it wouldn't be the first time a company pulled that trick, however that would be bound to be noticed by aficionados and it wouldn't do their reputation any good. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I can't speak to the specific whiskies that you mention, but you're right that it's something of a marketing trick. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would assume what's happening is that specific distilleries have the capacity to produce a certain quantity of whisky, but the market for an individual brand is lesser than this quantity. So instead of producing a larger quantity of a single brand, they produce slightly different whiskies under different names to encourage the consumer to buy more. After all, it makes more sense to have three different whiskies, than three bottles of the same whisky.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When it comes to mass-produced bourbons you're not going to see a heck of a lot of difference between different varieties, so if you're set on that style I'd recommend just picking one that's somewhere in the middle of the price range (not on the bottom of the barrel, but also not artificially priced as a 'premium' product). FWIW, my go to bourbon is 'Bulleit'.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another avenue you could take is to go for some entry-level scotches, something like a Glenmorangie Original. It might be a bit higher priced than bourbon, but you're going to get a better whisky.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is a little known Stellina that is produced by the Order of the Sainte Famille in France.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stellina&lt;/strong&gt; is a herbal liqueur made by the monastic order of the Sainte Famille (Holy Family) in Belley, France. It is considered similar to Chartreuse, both being made by monks in the same region, to secret recipes, and also coming in both green and yellow. However, Stellina is much younger (dating to 1904, rather than 1605), smaller (the Sainte Famille order has 300 members), and much less-known than Chartreuse. - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellina" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Stellina (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Order uses the revenues to help the various missions abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The secrecy is vital, he says, to protect the monastery’s key asset. “We receive a percentage of the sales and use it to help Third World countries. The money doesn’t pay for beautiful cars or houses, it finances our missions in Burkina Faso, the Ivory Coast and Benin, in India and the Philippines, and in Colombia, Brazil and Ecuador.” - &lt;a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2009/10/23/food/this-obscure-liqueur-may-save-your-soul/#.WZl9rfbn8dU" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;This obscure liqueur may save your soul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One wine comes to mind and that is the Apera wine produced in Australia. If you do a google search on apera and solera you will find numerous hits of wineries in Australia and Canada making something that is Sherry-like. Sherry is now a protected name place like Champagne, Chianti and Burgundy and can only be used in Spain of wines produced in the Jerez-Xeres-Sherry DO province of Cádiz in the region of Andalusia. Everything else produced in a sherry-like manner has to be called something else. Many have settled on the Apera (a play on Aperitif) name. See the "Protection of Sherry" in the Sherry &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherry" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are several other wines produced in the world using the Solera system and these include spanish Brandy, Marsala, Mavrodafni, Glenfiddich whisky, some Champagne, awamori in Japan and is well covered in your link in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solera" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Having owned and run a winery for 15 years (as well as making the wine, it was a small operation), you should concentrate on Sales, Marketing and Distribution about 90% of your effort. You could bottle paint thinner and with the right sales team and marketing you could make tons of money. I've seen it in the wine industry many times. People will say "if you make a quality product, people will buy it" is not true. Branding, marketing and sales make or break almost any product. Look at the Pet Rock for gods sake!&lt;/p&gt;
