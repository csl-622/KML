					&lt;p&gt;Most States have two different types of liquor licenses.  On premise and Off premise.  On premise is selling alcohol to drink there, off premise is for taking stuff home.  It is entirely possible that an establishment will only have one or the other.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It strongly depends on the country, but in many countries, including Poland, there is special tax on alcohol, called &lt;strong&gt;Excise&lt;/strong&gt;. You need to register your product for that tax, and you must also get special permit for selling alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are other procedures for registering as alcohol producer for selling them to publicity, and for getting &lt;strong&gt;permission&lt;/strong&gt; to sell your beer on place. You can always create your brewery! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the bar doesn't sell bottled beer, it means, that either the procedure of getting permit was &lt;strong&gt;too complicated&lt;/strong&gt; or the &lt;strong&gt;conditions&lt;/strong&gt; that need to be met made in &lt;strong&gt;not profitable&lt;/strong&gt;. Their business model is to sell beer on place and they are happy with that.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;They can, provided that they:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Further complicating the issue is that many breweries just don't want to, either because they make money on &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; growlers or because it's a pain to deal with the labeling when their bar is busy.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The German Beer Purity Law, also know as the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinheitsgebot"&gt;Reinheitsgebot&lt;/a&gt;, dictates what ingredients may be used to create beer in Germany: barley, hops, and water.  It dates back to 1487, which is why you may notice the omission of &lt;em&gt;yeast&lt;/em&gt;: it hadn't been recognized as an ingredient yet.  The law was removed from the books in 1993, and replaced by another similar law which allowed yeast, sugar, and some of the more common brewing ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the case of a US brewery making such a claim, it's a sort of advertisement toward the "purity" of their product, i.e., they don't use adjuncts (rice, etc) or other flavorings (fruit, spices) in their beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The purity law has been introduced to regulate the production of beer in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire" rel="nofollow"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The original text stipulated that the only ingredients that could be used in the production of beer were water, barley and hops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The "Reinheitsgebot" has actually survived the Holy Roman Empire. Many German brewers are proud of this heritage and claim to stick to it. It's relevance today is commercial. It's used as a label for marketing reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In addition to what's been said, the original purpose of the order was to protect consumers from brewers who used problematic (toxic/psychoactive) herbs to preserve their beer, instead forcing them to use hops.  Also only using barley allowed wheat and rye to be used exclusively by bakers to keep the cost of bread down.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One could argue the tradition has kept German brewers from innovating, and also keeps a lot of interesting styles out of reach.  Most Belgian-style beers, despite having a similar heritage to German styles, will include candi sugar and spices like anise and coriander.  Technically, sour beers are also out.  Also, a lot of the Trappist ales will use sugar adjuncts.  Today, it's mostly a statement of adherence to tradition, which can carry good marketing weight.  But this is beer, not marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure about Kentucky, but it seems to be legal here in NY. I've never ordered beer online as the shipping prices are astronomical and I've got a pretty decent beer distributor down the block with a large selection. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With that said, the way it seems to work is that the delivery person (whether it be UPS, FedEx, DHL, USPS, etc) ID's you at the door when you sign for the package. I've got a big dog (Neapolitan Mastiff) though, so my package carriers usually just sign for me and run for the hills when they have the displeasure of delivering something to my house haha. So I'm not sure if they'd bother checking my ID if I ever bought beer online. I'm perfectly legal drinking age though, so it doesn't matter.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With that said, you'd probably be best off looking through your local laws and maybe start a petition to have it legalized. I don't think its in the best interests of this community to be discussing loopholes in the law (despite how much I hate the government). I say start a petition, maybe it'll become a proposition and be placed on the ballot come election day. The only other option would be to have it shipped to another address in a border state if you live near the border. No online beer distributor is going to violate the law or tamper with it to make a buck, there's too much liability; they could lose their license and be put out of business.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Part of the answer has to do with how the beverages survived prohibition.  Winemakers were allowed to continue producing various grape products like grape juice, and even sold home wine kits with explicit instructions on how to avoid making wine from them.  Very tongue-in-cheek.  A lot of liquor distillers managed to survive somewhat on their liquors being considered "medicinal".  Beer, however, basically got demolished.  Especially considering their suffering during World War 1, which had just ended when prohibition began.  Any businesses that survived prohibition that used to be breweries either became producers of other products like ice cream or made barely alcoholic barley-based beverages.  Brewing in the US was at a huge disadvantage coming out of prohibition, and the few surviving large companies managed to successfully lobby to have the new distribution laws written to benefit them.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, as I mentioned wine and liquor sort of continued to be produced during Prohibition.  This led to their presence in the speakeasies, and their inclusion in the invention of many new cocktails.  People being used to them over the past few years, and the allure of being what was drank in speakeasies, acted as built in marketing.  Which beer lacked.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finally, beer was much less transportable than wine or liquor, especially liquor.  While localized wineries managed to survive, most people's local brewery had folded.  Liquor and wine became go-to drinks, and the only beer being promoted was from a few larger companies that needed to ramp up to reach everyone.  They were basically able to write their own ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;We're sort of in the opposite place now where consumer demand is for beer instead of liquor and wine, and the demand is for beer that's coming from smaller and more regional breweries, which I imagine is how wine was back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am not an historian, some of this is inference from known fact rather than referenced fact, but I think it makes sense and hopefully it helps you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h1&gt;Part of it is philosophical&lt;/h1&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Why are airplane pilots regulated differently from car drivers?  Because it's much easier to do damage with one vs the other.  Likewise, it's a lot easier to get so drunk that you do something stupid (or just get alcohol poisoning) on liquor than beer.  As such, they're treated differently.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h1&gt;Part of it is political&lt;/h1&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The companies that make beer are not generally the same ones that make liquor.  Those two groups of companies also have different groups of lobbyists, who have pushed for laws at different times in different political climates.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h1&gt;Part of it is practical&lt;/h1&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Liquor and beer production face different logistical needs.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Beer has much higher shipping costs per dollar worth of product, so shipping rules might need to be different.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Breweries have a need to keep their product cold at the point of sale, so it might make sense to have them sold in stores that already have coolers (like gas stations), whereas liquor companies wouldn't push as hard for that availability.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Liquor has no equivalent of the brewpub, so they don't really care much about sales at their production facility.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Beer has less consumer utility per unit of volume than liquor (ie, you need more of it to have the same amount of fun), so people generally need it closer to their houses.  Since you don't need to buy liquor as often as you buy beer, it's more feasible to have centralized liquor stores&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;h1&gt;Part of it is "moral"&lt;/h1&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Especially on the US East coast, there are a lot of laws around booze with their origins in religious morality and the puritan aversion to alcohol.  Beer, being seen as a "lesser evil", tends to have less opposition to laws that would increase its availability.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think it has something to do with the thinking of Whiskey Rebellion, -- a tax was on spirts but not wine or beer.  Whiskey was considered a luxury tax - yet it turns out a LOT of people were making and drinking Whiskey at the time&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In addition to the ground covered in other answers, some of it undoubtedly is historical in nature due to the fact that wine, beer, and other ales historically were consumed for hydration and energy.  &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/quora/2013/05/21/medieval_europe_why_was_water_the_most_popular_drink.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;This slate article&lt;/a&gt; covers some of this; while it was probably a myth that people drank ales as a source of clean water, they did hydrate and gain energy from them.  As such, beer and ale were associated with 'normal' consumption, much like soda would be today, and thus is treated somewhat differently from 'spirits', which have no real purpose other than getting one drunk, and even from wine, which was primarily associated with the nobility.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's complicated.  I think you have to look at these laws as an intersection of the practical and the cultural.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Let's look at two different distinctions you make.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home Production&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the US, you can usually make your own beer, mead, or wine, but cannot make hard liquor without a license from BATF, state licenses, tax payments, etc.  Exact laws of course vary state by state, but the US tax code contains exemptions for home brewers and wine makers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason here is historical.  Liquor is a major tax source, and black market liquor hasn't always been very safe.  We hear stories about wood alcohol making people go blind, but the real problems were either accidental heavy metal poisoning or deliberate adulteration with relatively nasty chemicals.  In practice methyl alcohol was not a major problem, particularly accidental inclusion of it, as in most concentrations primarily makes the hangover significantly worse (btw, red wine is known for harsh hangovers as are some fruit brandies because of methyl alcohol content).  The adulterants have included (and do include in some parts of the world) things like battery acid, caustic soda, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A second problem of course is safety.  In the distilling process, you are dealing the combination, usually, of heating elements or open flames and a liquid that is roughly as flammable as gasolene.  While it is quite possible to distil safely, there are generally acknowledged gains health and safety-wise to pushing for a formal economy here.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wine Tastings vs Beer Tastings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here laws vary considerably between states.  For example, the one part of the liquor code that is explicitly applied to home brewers is an exemption for home brewing competitions.  So you can take your beer to a competition without losing the home brewing exemption.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wine tastings have almost always had some acceptance on the theory that making fine wine has a level of cultural refinement and aesthetic nuance that beer does not (we may find this false but it an attitude --- if you don't believe me, compare reading a wine review with a beer review).  The wine culture is different from the beer culture and so they make a different case.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Again laws here vary state by state.  However, the argument, I think, is that wine tasting is essential to the sales process, while beer drinkers are less picky on average.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In essence these laws have a practical component particularly where hard liquor is concerned, and a cultural component.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Reviewing various state regulations on &lt;a href="http://www.gobyo.com/"&gt;GoBYO&lt;/a&gt;, corking fees generally do not appear to be mandatory but instead optional for establishments that already have liquor licenses.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beverage sales generally represent some of the highest profit items for restaurants.  Soda tends to have the highest margins since it is so cheap, but alcohol is easily a 200% or higher margin and sells per bottle/glass.  If people can bring in their own beverages without paying, or just paying cost, it dramatically reduces the amount of money a restaurant can make.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For a retail beer store that lets you drink on premises, it's possible that they are now dealing with two sets of rules, one for selling and one for consumption, or that they have to take on higher insurance liabilities.  You're also transforming retail space into dining space creating an opportunity cost.  This would justify an increased cost.  It would probably also wreck their general retail business if they tried not charging a corking fee.  If you knew of a bar where you could buy beer at retail cost, wouldn't you go there all the time?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Prior to the bill passing, only 12 ounce, 16 ounce or 32 ounce packaging was allowed. This prevented most craft beers from entering the state and to allow those entry, the law enacted stated that anything under 32 ounces or over 1 gallon would now be allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The unintended side affect of this law was that anything in between that range was still banned, including the 64 ounce container. 3 years ago, there was a bill written which would allow the sale of a 64 ounce container in Florida, but it was not sent to the floor for a vote because it involved other caveats with regards to craft breweries in the state. The main reason a vote was not taken was that the legislature felt that there should be more consideration taken to assist the craft brewers. Although that bill was stopped, the movement is still ongoing to have these container sizes legalized.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It isn't that half-gallon growlers are specifically illegal as such, but more of a quirk of how the different types and sizes of legal containers are defined.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Florida laws governing beer (or more accurately "malt beverage") container sizes specify that:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Individual containers of malt beverage sold or offered for sale shall
					  be no larger than 32 ounces.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The above law does not apply to malt beverages packaged "in bulk"
					  which is defined as a keg or "other individual container" containing 1
					  gallon or more of malt beverage.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So it isn't really that 32oz and 1 gallon growlers are legal and 64oz growlers aren't, it's that a 32oz container is the largest legal sized individual container, and a gallon is the smallest legal container for "bulk" packaging exempt from the  maximum container size regulation.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This outlines the basic laws for all states.  &lt;a href="http://www.brewersassociation.org/pages/government-affairs/growler-laws" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.brewersassociation.org/pages/government-affairs/growler-laws&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Growlers permitted under manufacturer license: Yes&lt;br&gt;
					Growlers permitted under brewpub license: Yes&lt;br&gt;
					Growlers permitted under retailer license: Yes&lt;br&gt;
					Specific "growler" language in statute: No  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is a link to the actual laws in Massachusetts on the this page too&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And since some people can't follow links, I'll do the research for them so they have the answers to their questions. First when looking for answers to legal questions ask a lawyer not random people on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"(i.e., that breweries are not able to fill growlers other than those with their own logo/which they themselves distribute)"&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Reading the laws and talking to some people the answer is yes you have to purchase the growler from the brewery.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It appears that there may be several laws in play here, but perhaps the interpretation of those laws by the Massachusetts  Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission, the brewers, and the Mass Brewers Guild that determine how growler fills work in practice.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The first law in question is the &lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/abcc/regulations.htm#LicensesandPermits6"&gt;regulation on labeling&lt;/a&gt;.  Nothing in there &lt;em&gt;appears&lt;/em&gt; to prevent brewers from filling any growler, but the standard interpretation from both the ABCC and the brewers is that they believe it makes it illegal for them to fill any growlers other than their own, and that is the policy by which they seem to all operate.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for retail establishments, there do seem to be some non-brewery bars that offer growlers, (see Ducali Pizzeria and Bar on &lt;a href="http://growlerdirectory.com/growler-stations/Massachusetts-MA"&gt;this list&lt;/a&gt;) but those may be for on-premise use.  There was a proposal for a bill to allow on-premise / off-premise licensees to do growler fills but as far as I can tell, it died in committee, primarily due to strong opposition from craft brewers who were worried it would cut into their bottle profits.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Beyond issues of distribution, the joint legislative committee also heard from industry members interested in allowing both on- and off-premise retailers to fill beer containers up to 64 ounces for take-away and off-site consumption. The bill, sponsored by Representative William Pignatelli, has caused some division in the industry between retailers and small brewers. “We think it would be a disaster for our business by cannibalizing our bottle sales, our only real income source,” says one small Massachusetts brewer. “We for one couldn't thrive in a situation where the profit on bottled beer transfers from brewery to store or bar.”&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;No, federal malt beverage labeling laws make it optional (though they &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; describe standards the label must meet if brewers &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; choose to add the alcohol content label.)  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;State laws, however, may require a brewer to add alcohol content to the label.  Clearly Delaware law (where Dogfish Head is based) must not.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In my experience, this is not terribly uncommon.  It is true that most beers do have alcohol content disclosed on the label, but I've run across quite a number that do not. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in learning more about it straight from the source, it's available in the Electronic Code of Federal Regulations in &lt;a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;amp;sid=d473aa9e89b3f7135e18c8da635f26aa&amp;amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title27/27cfr7_main_02.tpl"&gt;Title 27, Chapter I, Subchapter A, Part 7—LABELING AND ADVERTISING OF MALT BEVERAGES&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I also live in PA and am equally baffled by the PALCB regulations. If I had a dime for every time an out of stater asked me where they could buy alcohol, I could buy a brewery.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My guess would be the local beer you tried just hasn't gotten to registering in PA.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as opinions and rules on what beers can and can't be sold in PA, I'd think there are no official "rules", especially given the wide assortment of beer our supreme liquor overlords graciously allow us to consume. (I too could not find any set of standards for beer in PA)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If there is a vetting process, it's probably a black-box (Request goes in, ruling comes out with no hows or whys).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can visit &lt;a href="http://freemybeer.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;freemybeer.com&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about the restrictions in PA and learn how to contact your state representatives about changing the laws.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Don Russell asked Francesca Chapman (PLCB's Spokeswoman) in a Daily News article. Her response:
					"the registration requirement helps the state assure payment of state beer taxes and helps prosecutors identify alcoholic beverages in drunk driving cases or any other types of prosecution."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Article with some good points and source of quote &lt;a href="http://noplcb.blogspot.com/2010/03/why-does-beer-brand-registration-exist.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is what the PA Liquor Control Board has to say:
					&lt;a href="http://www.lcbapps.lcb.state.pa.us/webapp/legal/PublicAdvOpnDisplay.asp?opinion_year=2012&amp;amp;opinion_sequence=470" rel="nofollow"&gt;PA LCB answer to legality of selling growlers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, a growler is an open container, but it is up to the local police or state police to decide whether or not to enforce the law. My guess is that if the growler is full and out of your easy reach, you are probably OK unless you have given the cop some reason to hassle you. As I read the law, you are 100% legal if the growler is in the trunk of the car.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the growler is empty and clean (at least rinsed out), I think they would have a hard time pressing a case. If there is any beer or residue in it, then keep it in the trunk.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is a link to the &lt;a href="http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt?open=18&amp;amp;objID=737863&amp;amp;mode=2" rel="noreferrer"&gt;application for for registering beer brands&lt;/a&gt; As you can see on the form, there is a fee of $75 for each "beer brand". They define a "brand" as an individual beer style.  No big deal if you are Miller/Coors/Bud, but a real hassle if you are a micro with a couple of dozen seasonal beers. Note that you also must list the "importing distributors with whom territorial agreements have been established". So, I can see that getting a foot in the door would be a daunting task for a small brewery. And once a brewery is established, the process starts over every time they develop a new beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can thank &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gifford_Pinchot" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Gifford Pichot&lt;/a&gt; for this mess. He was the prohibitionist governor of PA when prohibition ended, and he established the PA LCB and State Store system to "discourage the purchase of alcoholic beverages by making it as inconvenient and expensive as possible." Recent efforts to reform the system keep failing because there are too many entrenched interests making money off of the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Retail stores in Colorado sell spirits, wine, and beer. Grocery and convenience stores sell 3.2 percent beer only, and then not between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. Package stores are open 8 a.m. until midnight and are closed on Sundays. Bars stop selling alcohol between 2 a.m. and 7 a.m.&lt;br&gt;
					&lt;a href="http://www.alcohollaws.org/coloradoalcohollaws.html"&gt;http://www.alcohollaws.org/coloradoalcohollaws.html&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would guess those "grocery stores" selling spirits and such are probably classified as something other than a grocery store.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This information may be a little out of date, Colorado does allow Sunday sales now. I found this on Wikipedia:  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Spirituous, vinous &amp;amp; malt liquor available in liquor stores and
					  liquor-licensed drug stores only.  Liquor stores closed on Christmas
					  Day. Sunday sales restriction lifted on July 1, 2008. Liquor stores
					  and liquor-licensed drug stores may have only one location, while 3.2%
					  beer may be sold in gas stations, supermarkets, and convenience
					  stores. Appropriately licensed businesses may also sell 3.2% beer for
					  both on and off-premise consumption. A small number of grocery stores
					  are licensed as drug stores and sell full strength beer, wine, and
					  spirits. As an example, a chain grocery store that has pharmacy
					  services at most or all locations may elect a single location in the
					  chain as the licensed establishment to sell beer, wine, and spirits.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The above answer is correct.  Just to expand a little, companies can only hold one Colorado retail liquor store license, which is the type of license that allows them to sell "full strength" beer, wine and spirits.  It's the same class of liquor license held by the liquor stores found in most shopping centers.  There is no limit to the number of 3.2% beer licenses a company can hold.  For example, a Safeway store in Glendale holds their only retail liquor store license, while Target holds theirs at a store in Littleton.  Their other Colorado stores all hold licenses to sell 3.2% beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is not legal to ship alcohol(beer, wine, or spirits) through the mail across state or national lines unless you have a license. This has to do with each state wanting to get it's tax revenue for the imported alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean it's not done, it's just less likely for a site that wants to stay in business to allow transactions that would result in it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have friends that are part of "exchange programs" that are on various forums. There is a "beertrade" sub Reddit for example.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In Colorado only 1 store in a chain is allowed to sell liquor, wine or full strength beer. These are known as 'State Stores'... So a chain like Target or King Soopers picks one location in the state that they want to have that license and that's the one that can sell it... All others are only allowed to sell 3.2 beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is in my opinion mainly thanks to low excise duty on beer in the Czech republic.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another factor is the fact that there are lower prices of almost everything in the Czech republic (I am talking mainly about local food and beverages).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And last but not least, Czech republic is I guess second or third in the whole world in beer consumption, which means there is high level of demand for traditional czech beer, which allows producers to produce beer in large quantities.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The answer is probably the dawn of human civilization.  Beer was probably one of the first consumables ever commercialized.  We can find commercial receipts for the sale of beer dating back over 4,000 years (Alulu beer receipt, 2050 BC) and advertisements for beer from even further back (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebla_tablets" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ebla Tablets, 2500-2250 BC&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hammurabi's Code from ~1750 BC has several sections detailing punishments for bartenders who try to short-change their customers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Realistically, beer has probably been a commercial product for longer than it hasn't.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am Czech and I would say there are few factors to it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Firstly many grocery products are cheap as well as services which makes beer affordable even in restaurants. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most importantly there is long historical tradition in drinking beer. It is common to drink it with lunch, it is usual to visit the pub for a chat with friends and drink 1,2 or 10 beers there. Beer is cheaper than water in restaurants and this is another reason why people prefer it to other drinks. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is said that the government can do anything unless they increase the price of beer. The pub is often the cultural center of many villages where people meet after work and when we are there we drink beer. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;it doesnt matter what beer you drink , whether it is a beer bought from the grocery store or a liquor store in colorado. it is all the same beer, bottled off the same vat. every beer is sold is measured alchohol by volume, except 3.2% beer which is measured as alcohol by weight. ask a brewer they will tell you the same. they ( the beer owners) did this so that they could get around the blue laws prohibiting beer sales on sunday, but without any cost increase to the business. if you drink coors light bought at a liquor store its 4.2% ABV, that very same beer bought at a 7-11 is 3.2% ABW. the measurement ABW is just about a 1% difference vs. ABV.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Alcohol free beer is not non-alcoholic, it does still contain some alcohol. It often contains around about 0,5%. A beer can be called alcohol-free from 1%.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To specifically respond to your situation I could not find any source saying that the Netherlands have an age restriction on alcohol-free beer. On the contrary the following sources indicate the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is also often seen as a gateway if you let kids buy bottles of lets say &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lH5hM.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Becks Blue&lt;/a&gt; it gets them in to drinking at a young age and as a younger body is still not fully developed it can lead to health issues or dependency on alcohol from an early age so it really comes down to not enough research on how a younger body can processes it and it is really hard to get that research done as we don't really want to be giving alcohol to kids &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Consumption of beer in the Czech Republic has been the highest in the world for many years. Bavarians claim that it is the highest in Bavaria, but they are not an independent country. Anyway, if we talked about historical lands then consumption of beer in Bohemia (Czechia's "mainland") would be higher than Bavaria.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is indeed a EU &lt;a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02008R0110-20090120" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Regulation No 110/2008&lt;/a&gt; about "&lt;em&gt;the definition, description, presentation, labelling and the protection of geographical indications of spirit drinks&lt;/em&gt;" which prescribes the minimal ABV for different spirits and it happens to be about 40%. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;the minimum alcoholic strength by volume of rum shall be 37,5 %.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;the minimum alcoholic strength by volume of &lt;em&gt;whisky&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;whiskey&lt;/em&gt; shall be 40 %.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;the minimum alcoholic strength by volume of vodka shall be 37,5 %.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;with the exception of ‘&lt;em&gt;Korn&lt;/em&gt;’, the minimum alcoholic strength by volume of grain spirit shall be 35 %.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;the minimum alcoholic strength by volume of wine spirit shall be 37,5 %.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;and some more.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Mendeleev#Vodka_myth" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Vodka myth&lt;/a&gt; may be of interest for you too.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;States often have different laws for beer and spirits, including different licensing requirements, different requirements for sales, and so forth.  Because of that, some states have limits on the percentage of alcohol that is allowed in beer.  In North Carolina, where I live, all spirits sales are state-controlled, and retail sales are only allowed in state-owned Alcohol Beverage Commission stores.  Beer, however, can be sold by traditional private retailers such as grocery stores and convenience stores.  Because of this, North Carolina also limits how much alcohol beer can contain; the maximum here is 15% ABV. (alcohol by volume.)  So, Samuel Adams Utopias is indeed illegal here, as are a number of Dogfish Head beers, and a few others.  &lt;/p&gt;
