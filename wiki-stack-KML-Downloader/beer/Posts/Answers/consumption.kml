					&lt;p&gt;How do Hungarians drink &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A1linka" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Palinka&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pálinka&lt;/strong&gt; should be served at 18–20 °C (64–68 °F) because it is at this temperature that the fine smell and taste of the fruit can be best enjoyed. If served too cold, the smell and the taste will be difficult to appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The form of the glass used to drink pálinka affects the drinking experience. The ideal glass is wide at the bottom and narrow at the rim, that is, tulip-shaped. The relatively narrow neck of the glass concentrates the "nose" released from the larger surface at the bottom of the glass, magnifying the smell of the drink. - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A1linka" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Pálinka (Wikipedia).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GKALk.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GKALk.jpg" alt="Pálinka  in Tulip Glasses served Sausages"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://visitbudapest.travel/budapest-events/budapest-palinka-and-sausage-festival/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Pálinka  in Tulip Glasses served Sausages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is traditionally drank in a tulip glass, straight and not mixed in one shot or sipped a little at a time. To truly appreciate Pálinka, it should &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Tips for Drinking Pálinka:&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ul&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Know your pálinka!: Kisüsti (meaning ‘a small pot’) is a double-distilled pálinka made in a copper pot. Érlelt (meaning ‘aged’) is a pálinka aged for at least three months in a wooden cask. Ó (meaning ‘old’) is aged for at least 12 or 24 months depending on the size of the cask. Ágyas (meaning ‘bedside’) is aged for at least three months together with fruit. Törköly (pomace pálinka) is made from grape pomace. It’s actually one of the oldest types of pálinka and it supposedly helps digestion.&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•It’s best to serve (and consume) at room temperature in a tulip-shaped shot glass. This temperature maintains the flavours of the fruits.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•There is no strict rule or tradition when to drink it however as Hungarian cuisine tends to be on the heavy side it’s good to have a shot (…or two) prior to a meal…and then close the meal off with another one (…or two).&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•It’s not compulsory to drink it in one go…. said no Hungarian ever! However we are lenient with foreigners so drink it slow!&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•It WILL burn your throat: don’t worry, that’s normal.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•The most popular flavours are apricot, plum, pear, cherry, grape and apple however flavours such as elderflower, quince and all sorts of berries are starting to become more popular. - &lt;a href="https://www.travelgluttons.com/how-to-drink-palinka/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;How to Drink: Pálinka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Pálinka is generally not mixed.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Though some &lt;a href="http://www.amathusdrinks.com/cocktails-palinka" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;mixologists&lt;/a&gt; are experimenting with adding pálinka to their cocktails, you’ll usually find it served on its own. The wince you’ll make in anticipation as you catch a whiff of your shot is all part of the fun, as is the expected slamming of your glass onto the table once you’ve finished your drink. - &lt;a href="http://www.iamtheglobe.com/ogcblog/2016/7/20/hungarys-water-of-life" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Hungary’s Water of Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And again:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Pálinka should be served somewhere between 10 - 15 °C. While many drink it as a shot, the more traditional Hungarians will drink it as a low drink, sort of like whisky. Don’t be surprised if you hear people shouting ‘Isten, Isten’ (God, God) before drinking it, that is just part of the Pálinka tradition. - &lt;a href="https://drinkedin.net/blog/548-p%C3%A1linka-the-hungarian-whisky.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Pálinka - The Hungarian Whisky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hungarians love to eat sausages with their Pálinka, as can be seen at their &lt;strong&gt;Budapest Pálinka and Sausage Festival&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Sausage and pálinka go well together, so be sure to visit one of the sausage stands and sample their homemade products, such as Gyulai and Csabai kolbász. - &lt;a href="http://visitbudapest.travel/budapest-events/budapest-palinka-and-sausage-festival/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Budapest Pálinka and Sausage Festival&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/social-issues-migration-health/health-at-a-glance-2017_health_glance-2017-en#page74" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;OECD&lt;/a&gt; (The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development), alcohol consumption in its member countries (which includes the US) has been decreasing since [at least] 2000. Litres of pure alcohol consumed (a metric for standardizing alcohol consumption across drinks of varying alcohol content) has fallen from 9.5 litres per capita in 2000 to 9 litres in 2015 (roughly 5% decline).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The definition of alcoholism can vary since it typically includes the frequency of consumption within its own definition. The paper I cited includes stats on binge drinking (at least once a month) by gender, but does not compare data to prior years. There's been a ton of research on this topic, so a bit of googling should quickly turn up something useful. &lt;a href="http://www.camh.ca/en/research/news_and_publications/reports_and_books/Pages/default.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;CAMH&lt;/a&gt; has useful publications and so does the &lt;a href="http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/disease-prevention/alcohol-use/publications/2016/public-health-successes-and-missed-opportunities.-trends-in-alcohol-consumption-and-attributable-mortality-in-the-who-european-region,-19902014-2016" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But, if you read this, it sounds like Alcohol consumption (along with all it's problems including addiction) has increased significantly in the USA. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/10/542409957/drinking-on-the-rise-in-u-s-especially-for-women-minorities-older-adults" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;This study&lt;/a&gt; is out just last summer (2017) &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"In the '90s, however, alcohol consumption increased — the percentage
					  of people who drank at all increased by nearly half, while high-risk
					  and disordered drinking increased by about 20 percent and 12 percent,
					  respectively."&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you go all the way back to Prohibition, then it has clearly &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://static.vinepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/chart2.png&amp;amp;imgrefurl=http://digg.com/2017/history-of-american-alcohol-consumption&amp;amp;h=612&amp;amp;w=800&amp;amp;tbnid=plCgmP2nFMvupM:&amp;amp;tbnh=160&amp;amp;tbnw=209&amp;amp;usg=__0ua7GzjkOM2-EE9vnhwvKQiwfoY%3D&amp;amp;vet=10ahUKEwj-94PZjsbXAhUG0WMKHd3lDMEQ9QEILDAA..i&amp;amp;docid=ox_9Behu8jVFQM&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-94PZjsbXAhUG0WMKHd3lDMEQ9QEILDAA" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;increased&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
