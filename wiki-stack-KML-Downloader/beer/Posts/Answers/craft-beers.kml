					&lt;p&gt;The question could be changed to "craft Italian beer" or "Italian real ale" instead of good. That would fix the question quality. 
					To answer the better question, there are about 360 micro-breweries in italy under the umbrella MoBI organization (&lt;a href="http://www.movimentobirra.it/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.movimentobirra.it/&lt;/a&gt;) which is similar to CAMRA and has an English translation to their website. I would recommend using that as an initial source of information as breweries change and I am not familiar with the Florence area. 
					&lt;a href="http://www.pintamedicea.com/birra/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.pintamedicea.com/birra/&lt;/a&gt; based in Florence may also be helpful depending on your level of Italian language skills. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some of the highest ranked breweries in Italy include:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Le Baladin (Highly recommended but these might be harder to find)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Panil Birra Artigianale&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Revelation Cat Craft Brewing&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Birra del Borgo&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Birrificio Toccalmatto&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Birrificio Lambrate&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Maltus Faber&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Note that in Europe there aren't as many mega breweries so local craft brewing is much more popular.  You should look for a local brewery for fresher and more easily accessible (in terms of cost and rarity). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;www.beersofeurope.co.uk&lt;/strong&gt; are very good, used them 4 times.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;www.beersofeurope.co.uk/usa&lt;/strong&gt; lists a number of beers, just a case of scrolling through and selecting into the cart/basket.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Delivery is £7.50 but I find it's worth paying a bit extra to get what you want / try new beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I can recommend www.alesbymail.co.uk I used them at Christmas 2014 to send a mixed case (chosen by myself) to my family in France. Can't remember exact European delivery costs but it was very reasonable compared to the cost of the beers or I wouldn't have used it. Check their Twitter @alesbymail for regular discount codes. (I have no affiliation with them other than being a satisfied customer).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When considering barley wine there are two varieties recognized by the &lt;a href="http://bjcp.org/docs/2015_Guidelines_Beer.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;BJCP in the 2015 style guidlines&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;American version&lt;/strong&gt; which has an emphasis on hops, IMO not as similar to old ale.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;English version&lt;/strong&gt; which while hoppy is also sweeter and has more fruity flavors than the American version and IMO does seem similar to old ale. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If I were to compare an English barley wine to an old ale the differences among the higher end of the style seem minimal. However, I think that even on the higher end the old ale has an emphasis on the aged quality. In the smaller versions, less ABV, examples of English barely wine I think it is less malty than an old ale. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I also found the BJCP style guidelines style comparison useful for the English barley wine and old ale because they are so similar. I've included them below for reference.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Old Ale Style Comparison:&lt;/strong&gt;
					Roughly overlapping the British Strong Ale and the lower end of the English Barleywine styles, but always having an aged quality. The distinction between an Old Ale and a Barleywine is somewhat arbitrary above 7% ABV, and generally means having a more significant aged quality (particularly from wood). Barleywines tend to develop more of a ‘mature’ quality, while Old Ales can show more of the barrel qualities (lactic, Brett, vinous, etc.)." (From BJCP 2015 guidelines)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;English Barley Wine Style Comparison&lt;/strong&gt;:
					 Although often a hoppy beer, the English Barleywine places less emphasis on hop character than the American Barleywine and features English hops. English 
					versions can be darker, maltier, fruitier, and feature richer specialty malt flavors than American Barleywines. Has some overlap British Old Ale on the lower end, but generally does not have the vinous qualities of age; rather, it tends to display the mature, elegant signs of age." (From BJCP 2015 guidelines)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/DecentGadget-Refractometer-Measure-Sugar-content/dp/B00FFB3YYI" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; device on Amazon - which I believe will do what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DJ2pg.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DJ2pg.jpg" alt="Decent Gadget Brix Refractometer Measure Sugar content for Beer Wine "&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brix Refractometer Measure Sugar content for Beer Wine&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It determines the sugar content not just in beers, but in wines as well (also fruits etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What is a refractometer?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;A refractometer is an optical device that, like a hydrometer, measures the specific gravity of your beer or wort. It does so by sampling a small amount of liquid, and looking at its optically. The main advantage over a hydrometer is the small sample size needed – typically only a few drops.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Most brewing refractometers measure samples in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brix" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Brix&lt;/a&gt;, which is a scale used to measure specific gravity primarily by wine makers. Some also use a Refractive Index (RI) scale. Both the Brix and RI indexes need to be converted to standard specific gravity or Plato scales using a formula, as wort does not have the same reflective properties as plain sugar water.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using Your Refractometer when Beer Brewing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Using the refractometer is very similar to what you just did when calibrating it. Open the sample plate, make sure it is clean and dry, then add a few drops of your wort. Again, if the wort is hot allow it to cool to room temperature first (ideally 68F). Close the sample plate, check for bubbles, and then hold the refractometer up to a natural light source.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Reading the refractometer is easy – just take the reading directly from the sight scale. The reading you take will most likely be in percent/degrees Brix or RI. - &lt;a href="http://beersmith.com/blog/2010/11/02/how-to-use-a-refractometer-brix-and-beer-brewing/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;How to Use a Refractometer, Brix and Beer Brewing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It would depend on the craft beer. Regular cheap beer is not a good comparison as you don't typically get the same style of beer. Craft rules are not the same everywhere.  Typical rules is water, hop, barley, and yeast.  A non craft can use other ingredients but that same 4 is going to be the bulk.  A craft tends to be denser so in the case it would have more nutrients.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So... I guess it depends on what you're deeming nutritional &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Beer has 4 main ingredients:  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Water&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Grain&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Yeast&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Hops&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The biggest mineral difference is going to come from the water source of the brewery. Following the exact same formula recipe/mashing instructions/yeast used/fermentation conditions (temperature, altitude, fermentation vessel)/time/etcetera... you can get very different flavor beers if the water source is different. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The next varying source of minerals would probably be in yeast. Unfortunately, I can only find &lt;a href="http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/custom/1323569/2" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;evidence of all brewing yeast lumped together&lt;/a&gt; at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The interesting part in craft brewing, especially at the homebrew-mad-science level, becomes all of the additives that can be placed into beer. I once met a brewer that &lt;a href="https://byo.com/hops/item/569-dry-hopping-techniques" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;dry-hopped&lt;/a&gt; smoked salmon bones (right they aren't hops but the same technique) in their secondary fermentation (or clarifying stage) chamber!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These examples would be more "here is a random thing" that I found rather than being able to give you a definite answer as to "more nutrition" being provided than big-beer manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you're not going to easily achieve the solution to your question. Your best bet would be to find the nutritional information for the beer you seek. It isn't readily available, though, &lt;a href="https://www.brewbound.com/news/how-the-fdas-new-calorie-count-requirements-impact-brewers" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;legislation has passed&lt;/a&gt; requiring craft beer producers to provide this information. While this sounds logical - this can significantly impact smaller craft brewers. :( &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can't actually tell what the sugar content is of a beer without knowing the &lt;a href="http://homebrewmanual.com/beer-gravity-chart/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Final Gravity&lt;/a&gt; of the wort before fermentation giving you the &lt;a href="http://homebrewmanual.com/beer-gravity-chart/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Original Gravity&lt;/a&gt;. These difference in OG-FG tell you the Alcohol By Volume of the beer in question. &lt;a href="http://www.calculator.org/property.aspx?name=specific%20gravity" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Specific gravity&lt;/a&gt; is measured in kg/(m^3) - I'm sure there is some math that could be done to figure out how to convert a known Final Gravity into know sugar amounts.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The downside becomes knowing what &lt;a href="https://byo.com/bock/item/1441-sweetness-brewing-sugars-how-to-use-them" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;type of sugars&lt;/a&gt; were in the original recipe. Without knowing exactly what went into the beer (and recipes can be quite proprietary) - you'll be hard pressed to figure out exact sugar content.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've been holding off answering this question because it's very complicated. First, I am assuming the original poster wants to know sugar content in finished beer, not in pre-fermented wort. If that is not the case, I will pull my answer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the wine industry it's pretty straight forward to measure residual sugar since all you are dealing with is leftover fructose from the unfermented portion of the wine. One sugar, easy. It's pretty accurate with a &lt;a href="https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/aimtab-ketone-tablets-100-pk/23111357" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Clinitest (now Aimtabs&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But with beer, it's different story because you are dealing with several types of sugars and frankly brewers don't have the same problems with unfermented sugars that winemakers do. (This is how we have fizzy wine!) So, finding a test for residual sugar in beer is not only more complicated but rare. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You cannot use a refractometer or hydrometer to measure residual sugars directly since alcohol influences the end results. One method is to evaporate the alcohol content and then with the alcohol gone you could measure the sugars directly. This would have to be done with vacuum distillation so you don't lose the water content.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I did find an &lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2050-0416.1978.tb03832.x/pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;old paper from 1977&lt;/a&gt; which describes several scientific methods but these are generally too hard for the average person to take on. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;MEASUREMENT OF CARBOHYDRATES IN WORT AND BEER &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;By G. K. Buckee and R. Haroitt
					  (Brewing Research Foundation, Nutfield, Redhill, Surrey)
					  Received 20 May 1977 &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Methods are reviewed for measuring total wort and beer carbohydrate and carbohydrate fractions, such as dextrins, oligosaccharides, fermentable sugars, jS-glucans, total  fructose and fructosans, pentose and pentosans. The methods are conveniently classified under the following headings: reductometry, colorimetry, enzymic procedures, automated analyses, paper and column chromatography, thin layer chromatography, gas liquid chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography. Techniques involving chromatography are particularly useful for separating and estimating individual sugars.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Does she bake? If she does, and especially if she bakes bread, then ask her how you know her baked goods aren't poison. Beer has been known as liquid bread for many centuries for good reason; it contains essentially the same ingredients (with a bit of hop for taste so you may have to term it herb bread). If she doesn't agree that home-baked bread could be poison as much as homemade beer could be then she is being irrational. That leads me to the second idea. Does she trust commercial beers not to be poison? Why? They are made in a chemical factory. This is a chemical factory holding tonnes of potentially lethal chemicals (particularly the chemicals used to clean the vessels but also if you have a bag of barley fall on you it is lethal(!)). Large commercial breweries (Heineken etc. rather than, say, Sambrook's) are even worse as they inject all kinds of chemicals into the natural product to keep it from spoiling and to add fizz. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The only reason why she should be worried is if she doesn't trust you and, in the end, if your mother doesn't trust you to make food or drink no one can solve that.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think the first step in attempting to change a belief of another person is always to understand why they hold that view. That can even help with determining how likely you are to be successful. For example, if her concern is that you may be actively trying to poison her, you're probably not very likely to change her mind. But if instead her concern is just that you may screw up something and produce a contaminated and therefore unsafe drink, that may be easier to handle. But you would use a different argument than if her concern was that you obtained the ingredients from an untrusted source.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To address the latter two options, the simplest way may just be too brew your beer, drink in on several occasions, and then have your continued health be the evidence that it's not poisonous. This has the added benefit of checking it first to make sure it tastes reasonably good (poisonous or not if it doesn't come out well you may want to wait till next time to have her try it).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Attacking it from a more logical perspective, there are a few other arguments you can make:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Beer was, for quite some time, a product that was made more because it was safe to drink than because it was tasty. Not being able to trust their water sources, brewing beer was a way to make a drink that was not only less likely to make your sick but also an important source of nutrition.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;From the research I've done, I couldn't find any instance of someone becoming dangerously sick from homebrew. Maybe the occasional upset stomach or bathroom problems but as long as you're being reasonable about cleaning and sanitizing the equipment an infected batch is almost certainly just a matter of it tasting bad, not a matter of your health.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;A big part of the reason for the above points is that the alcohol produced during fermentation should be enough to inhibit the growth of any dangerous microorganisms. That should hold true for even extremely low ABV beers (&amp;lt;1%).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Unless you're using dirty, hand-me-down equipment and either aren't cleaning it or aren't properly sanitizing it, you shouldn't​ be able to end up with anything dangerous*. Even then you're more likely to just end up with something you don't like. Long story short, if it tastes and smells good, you'll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;* One caveat here: &lt;a href="http://www.homebrewtalk.com/wiki/index.php/Bottle_bomb" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;bottle grenades&lt;/a&gt; are a serious issue and can be dangerous. Make sure you clean and sanitize your bottles well and don't bottle until your beer has reached its final gravity. That said, this is more of a physical safety issue than something that makes the beer unsafe to drink.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To the other answers I would add: point out that you're working from a &lt;em&gt;kit&lt;/em&gt;.  Like prepared kits for bread-machine bread, stir-fry sauces, and spice mixes, your beer kit is designed to minimize variables and avoid beginner mistakes.  If you follow the instructions in the kit, you can't screw it up -- and if you did, the worst outcome would be that you don't like the taste.  (Assuming your equipment is clean.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your mother, not being a brewer, probably has no idea what's involved.  If you explain the kit concept by comparing it to kits she's already familiar with, you should be able to persuade her that your kit is safe.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Perhaps your mom is thinking that home brewing is like home canning, where a mistake can have disastrous results like growing botulism toxin. A little research into that problem shows that one of the common precautions in home canning is to add citrus juice or vinegar to the mixture of food being processed, and that it isn't required for tomato-based recipes such as stewed tomatoes or pasta sauce. Why does this help? Because there are no known pathogens that can live in acidic solutions, and citrus, vinegar and tomatoes all have relatively low pH. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And this is why home brewing is a safe pastime: wort is naturally too acidic to support pathogen growth. Any microorganisms that grow in wort are safe to consume. Most of them will affect the flavor of the beer, and that is why we do our best to control them, but none of them can harm you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;States often have different laws for beer and spirits, including different licensing requirements, different requirements for sales, and so forth.  Because of that, some states have limits on the percentage of alcohol that is allowed in beer.  In North Carolina, where I live, all spirits sales are state-controlled, and retail sales are only allowed in state-owned Alcohol Beverage Commission stores.  Beer, however, can be sold by traditional private retailers such as grocery stores and convenience stores.  Because of this, North Carolina also limits how much alcohol beer can contain; the maximum here is 15% ABV. (alcohol by volume.)  So, Samuel Adams Utopias is indeed illegal here, as are a number of Dogfish Head beers, and a few others.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You want a mildly flavored, low hop beer for something like this. I would suggest a Kolsch or Helles Lager or a Mild. Pilsners can be heavily hopped. I have done a lot of this with wines when I taught winemaking classes at a community college near here. We used very low aroma wines like a warm climate sauvignon blanc. You want the same for this since you don't want anything to get in the way of your samples. Also keep a small cup of coffee beans and water nearby to "reset" your nose and mouth between smelling and tasting. I wouldn't do two different beers it will muddy things. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You should definitely all use the same beer as the base, and you want a beer that has a good balance of hops and malt. The less flavor the beer has, the more the "spiked" flavors and aromas will stand out. Too much aromatic hops (e.g., an IPA) will mask the aromas. Too much malt will mask the flavors. A lighter, neutral beer is the way to go for an educational tasting.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I agree with everything farmersteve said except for the part about the coffee beans. That's an extremely strong flavor and aroma that will taint the beer tasting. As one who dislikes coffee, I can say that smelling coffee beans would ruin whatever beer sample I next tasted.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would choose Coors. It's easy to get, always tastes the same so it makes for a good control. Also, it is light in flavor so it won't mask anything. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am not 100% versed in this but I am assuming that Canada needs to import most of their hops. This could make it too expensive to provide a quality product when the ingredients are so expensive to buy. If you take that into account and the fact that alcohol, in general, is way more expensive in Canada than in the US, it makes sense that the brewers would skimp out on ingredients to keep their beer prices affordable.  There is more variety available to us in States than in Canada too. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It seems that Canada is in need for more hop growers to help alleviate this problem. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;An article about Canadian hop growers that might be relevant. &lt;a href="https://www.albertafarmexpress.ca/2017/07/04/hop-in-growing-craft-brewery-market-drives-demand-for-local-hops/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.albertafarmexpress.ca/2017/07/04/hop-in-growing-craft-brewery-market-drives-demand-for-local-hops/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some sugars won't start a fermentation with brewer's yeast at all, such a lactose. In such case, sooner or later other organisms would take over (e.g. lactobacteria).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Any sugars that can be fermented, would ferment at different speeds. As there is usually more than one kind of sugar present, the easy ones ferment first until the alcohol kills off the yeast, leaving the more difficult ones behind. Fermentation usually continues at that point, just a lot more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The difference in the effect is minor as long as everything is fully fermented. An example of such a difference is fruit wines and beer. Fruit wines contain minor amounts of methanol while beer usually does not. Differences in flavour are more about what is not fermented.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Mannose can definitely be fermented by brewer's yeast. Dextrose is just another name for glucose.     &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If your craft beer is unfiltered, unpasteurised beer with live yeast, then any kind of transport could alter its flavour profile. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Other variables that could effect its flavour are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;changes in altitude (not during flight)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;no resting after transport (depending on yeast content up to two weeks)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;bottling problems (oxygen in bottleneck)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;difference between drinking and ambient temperature (e.g. beers taste different in summer and winter)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;olfactory changes (flu, humidity, ambient smells)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;drinking method (glass or bottle make a taste difference)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;transporting bottles that are not so fresh (closer to their exp. date)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Pure speculation/unlikely:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;cosmic radiation&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;altitude changes during flight irreversible&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Any of the above mentioned changes in temperature as well as choosing a glass instead of a bottle etc. effect CO² in various ways. This results in a different drinking sensation (the tingling in the nose; try "smelling" the CO² and compare with a flat beer) and different taste (pH). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Humidity, climate, season could alter your perception. An imperial stout for instance takes you over the edge in summer while you would feel perfectly fine in winter.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ambient temperature has an immense effect on the beer. It effects nearly everything from how much CO² is released upon opening the bottles to what the perfect drinking temperature is. The drinking temperature has an immense effect on how strong hops, sugars and alcohol taste.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Such changes in taste are not unheard of and more likely to occur in strong, malty beers. Flights are not necessary to have such an effect. Any long-distance transport would do.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To test if the beer has actually changed during transport, you could try transporting it back. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From what I understand, pale ale is not as hoppy as India pale ale. So, quantity of hops and IBU of IPA’s will be generally higher compared to pale ales. American pale ales use American hops instead of traditionally popular European hops from what I understand.&lt;/p&gt;
