					  &lt;p&gt;Moonshine is any alcohol that is made illegally. It is usually make in
					  small batches&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In most cases if you are able to buy 'Moonshine' from a store it is generally not real moonshine &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I believe that it's called moonshine because it was illegal to make, so it was usually distributed at night time under the moonlight hence the name 'Moonshine'. It was popular to make as they could produce a high % drink very quickly but in most places there is a legal amount of time you have to distill an alcohol for. Moonshiners did not adhere to these rules hence why the drink was illegal.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In places where moonshine has been legalized it would then I would not consider it not moonshine anymore as that just means they have allowed the distillers to bottle after any time they want in the processes instead of giving a set time for minimum distillation &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are some legal Moonshine distillery's that label their alcohol as moonshine but most of these are playing on the growing trend of moonshine as all of these are still legit distillery's they pay all the taxes and ship out there product so this is perfectly legal and they call it moonshine. while this is not a original moonshine, as it is all legal. moonshine can be any really high proof alcohol but once that alcohol is sold and distributed legally it just becomes the same as any-other spirit and looses the true nature of being moonshine   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Moonshine derives (supposedly) its name from transporting it at night to avoid detection.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Moonshine was made a lot in the mountains because of the inaccessibility of where the mountain-folk would hide the Stills and the abundance of fresh mountain springs. They could also make the moonshine high proof to maximize cost/drunk ratio (I know it sounds close minded but not a ton of reasons to buy high proof alcohol).  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Liquor is measured in proof which is just 2x the alcohol % listed - 40% Vodka is 80Proof. There is not commercial grade 200 proof moonshine mainly because of physics. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;This is because ethanol is not an ordinary mixture, it’s an azeotrope. Instead of boiling purely and separately at two different temperatures, its vapor will form a certain proportion. Steam from alcohol is 95.57 percent alcohol. Get a pot of 95.57 percent ethanol boiling and the steam will be 95.57 percent ethanol right down until the last drop evaporates.
					  &lt;a href="http://io9.gizmodo.com/why-cant-you-make-liquor-thats-100-percent-pure-alcohol-1701953611" rel="nofollow"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are probably other moonshiners across the country; but, the origin is steeped in the Appalachian Mountains. Junior Johnson (a NASCAR Driver) started his own line of spirits and has "moonshine." They aren't over 100 proof though...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Generally, when people refer to "moonshine" and they are referring to what can be purchased legally, they are really referring to "white whiskey" (a.k.a. un-aged whiskey), or whiskey that has not been aged in an oak barrel.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most whiskey is fermented from either all-corn, or corn and an other grain (like rye), but there are some boutique type whiskeys that use other grains like quinoa, spelt, flax, etc.  Technically any grain can be used to make whiskey, but it doesn't become "whiskey" until it has been placed in an oak barrel.  There are only a few other "rules" like the proof at which it is distilled. Whiskey has to come out of the still at 95% ABV (190 Proof) and then cut with water to nothing lower than 40% ABV (i.e. 80 Proof or higher).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Vodka can be made from corn, but unlike whiskey, it can be made from really anything that can be fermented.  Some of the most common starts for Vodka are potatoes, wheat, rye, and a few other grains, but Vodka can be made from virtually anything else that can ferment like grapes (Ciroc vodka), tomatoes, cucumbers, donuts, you name it. I have seen almond vodka and even milk vodka (as in vodka fermented from almonds and from milk respectively).  Vodka has to come out of the still at &gt;95% ABV, but as long as it is cut with water to at the minimum of 80 poof (40% ABV) or higher, it's vodka. No matter what it started with.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The same exact corn "vodka" can be called whiskey it is comes out at the 95% ABV and then is placed in oak barrels. Note that I wrote "placed" and not "aged" in oak.  Whiskey has no age requirement, so the "white whiskeys" you see that do not read "moonshine" have at least touched oak.  If you see that the label reads "moonshine whiskey", it has touched oak too, if it just reads "moonshine" and has not ever touched an oak barrel, then technically is it strong grain vodka, but "moonshine" sounds more renegade I suppose. Corn "vodka" that comes out of the still at 96%ABV or higher, but doesn't touch oak is still Vodka, but technically could also be called "Moonshine".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Whiskey can be called "bourbon" if it is made in the USA, from 51% corn. It has to come out of the still at no more than 160 proof/80%ABV and it goes into the barrel at 125 Proof (62.5%ABV), and it has to be in the oak for at least 4 years in bonded warehouses under the U.S. government record. Thanks to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottled_in_bond" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Bottle-in-bond Act of 1897&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It depends on where and how long you store them.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In a cabinet or in a showcase with glass windows, the light is affecting the aging and changing progress.
					I made experiences with 15 year old Whiskeys, Bourboun and Scotch which were very much affected because they were opened before(to the point where it wasn't drinkable anymore).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In your case, it is important how long you store your bottle, if it is under one or two years, from my experience, you should be fine because high percentage beverages last very long.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a reference, the same goes for &lt;a href="http://www.popsugar.com/food/How-Tell-Wine-Has-Gone-Bad-2742039" rel="nofollow"&gt;wine&lt;/a&gt; but in a much lesser quantity of time.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps you a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have never head of safety concerns, especially if the bottle is properly recapped, but what often is an issue is oxidization, and exposure to sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It happens much more slowly to liquors than to things like foods or wines, but every time you open the bottle you let oxygen get in, especially so the first opening, which will affect it though its really only slightly. The sunlight has similar affects on the spirits, to a similar magnitude (i.e. not very much).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Vodka for example should be fine nearly indefinitely if properly kept, but whiskeys, gins, tequilas, rums, and the more complex liquors will degrade (again, only slightly and slowly). I've heard people say they can taste changes in 3-4 months, others years, but even if you have a bottle around for a year or two I really wouldn't have any concerns (I'm kinda skeptical of the 3-4 month people)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've had whiskeys and rums left around for 4-5 years after opening. They weren't great spirits themselves, but there was nothing unpalatable about them.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are concerned, I would just keep your spirits in a cool, dry, dark space and then you probably don't have to give it a second thought.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wow, your question bring back memories.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My grandfather collected bottle of various hard liquors while in the military (World War II) and had them in a liquor cabinet in the basement. After the war, he stopped drinking and there in his cabinet where was a large number of bottles that were almost all opened, yet I would guess were at least 75% full. Occasionally we would have some at Christmas or some other occasions and they seemed quite fine to us back in the day. Some of his bottles were decades old.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But in reality how long will hard liquor remain good?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;There's no need to replace those decades-old bottles of gin and whisky. Distilled spirits like vodka, rum, whisky, tequila and gin don't ever spoil — even after opening. The taste, color or aroma may fade over time, but it'll hardly be noticeable. Keep the bottles tightly closed and store them in a cool area away from direct heat or sunlight. - &lt;a href="http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/photos/forever-foods-10-cooking-staples-that-can-outlast-you/hard-liquor" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Forever foods: 10 cooking staples that can outlast you&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;How Long Do Spirits Last?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spirits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The easiest class of booze to keep, sprits will generally last forever—although that statement comes with a couple of caveats.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Spirits are usually high enough in proof that their alcohol content will preserve them indefinitely. Of course, because of that same alcohol content, you need to be sure to store them in a cool place. Above a radiator is not the right answer.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Spirits do not "get better" in the bottle; they do not generally develop additional flavors in glass. For a spirit to age in the sense that we mean when talking of aged spirits, they need to age in wood. Glass doesn't impart additional flavor or aroma.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Two things will happen to spirits in glass, however: &lt;strong&gt;oxidation and evaporation.&lt;/strong&gt; As the booze reacts with oxygen, its flavors diminish over time. For short periods, this effect is subtle. Keep an open bottle of bourbon around a couple of months, and you probably won't notice any difference. Store it for years, though, and you might find it tastes a little flatter than when it was brand new.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;A small amount of evaporation from the bottle is inevitable and unavoidable; to make sure it stays just a small amount, though, remember what I said before: keep the booze in a cool place.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;But say you have a special bottle, something you want to keep around for a long time, and sip slowly over years. How can you protect the stuff inside? The simple answer is, &lt;strong&gt;transfer it into a smaller bottle.&lt;/strong&gt; A few remaining ounces of that perfect single-malt, stored in its original bottle, will continue to react with the oxygen that fills up the bottle. A smaller vessel simply has less room for that spirit-snuffing oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Now, is this necessary? Probably only if you're a collector or true spirits enthusiast. I doubt most drinkers would notice. - &lt;a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2012/09/cocktail-101-how-long-do-spirits-liqueurs-vermouth-last.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;How Long Do Spirits Last? by Michael Dietsch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have episodes of heartburn, usually from eating beef or potatoes and I find it very soothing to drink a splash of bitters in club soda.  I make homemade bitters with ginger, grapefruit, gentian root, and several spices that seem to be the most effective. Bitter herbal liqueurs are popular in Europe for before or after a meal to stimulate the appetite or aid digestion.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Gentian root is one of the most common bitter agents. While I don't know of any clinical studies, gentian root has been used in herbal medicine for centuries to treat digestive issues. It makes sense from an evolutionary perspective because bitter compounds are mostly found in plants and are often more or less poisonous. If the body produces more digestive enzymes in response to bitter flavors, the extra enzymes can neutralize the poison or extract more nutrition from the plant material. It's certainly not totally effective, salivary enzymes won't save you from hemlock poisoning, but it could reduce the ill effects of mild poisons. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Angostura bitters and club soda is a regular drink in my house. I find that it calms my stomach and just generally makes me feel better. I like to use a heavy dose of bitters--usually like 8-10 dashes--per 8 oz of soda.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Fernet is also a real godsend for digestive ailments, but be warned that it's very, very bitter. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think your best option is a &lt;a href="http://whiskeyrambler.blogspot.com/2010/09/delicious-drink-alert-guayabita-del.html"&gt;Guayabita de Pinar&lt;/a&gt;. It's a spirit made with tiny guava fruits, it's nice and sweet. I'd choose the one made by La Occidental. Here's a good &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/91685249@N06/10945850816"&gt;picture of it&lt;/a&gt; from flikr.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Otherwise Aguardiente de Cuba is an option. Aguadiente means firewater, and it's not nearly as friendly as the Guayabita. My understanding is that it's related to rum in the way that mescal is to tequila. Funky. I'd only go for it if you have a decent amount of cocktail experience and you'd like to experiment. Ron Santero makes the most popular bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, you might consider something like a local soda, or some Coca-Cola. Coke &lt;a href="http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/faq/does-coca-cola-produce-the-same-drinks-in-every-country"&gt;changes the recipe&lt;/a&gt; depending on where it's shipped, so if you want to drink a proper Cuba Libre ask for some.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Fig liqueur completed after 4 weeks.  Here are notes:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;A lot more work than I expected it would be to strain out the liquid.
					Next time I'll use a food processor instead of making the base puree
					by hand. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;It's much darker than I expected &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The taste is nice, a little tannic on the finish. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;I've successfully used it in a Collins-type cocktail - in a rocks glass, add:

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;2 ounces fig liqueur, chilled&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;1.5 tbsp simple syrup &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;juice of 1 lime wedge &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;sparkling water to top&lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think you are misunderstanding what "fruit spirits" are. It is essentially ethanol. Spirits (or ethanol) are derived from something fermenting. This can be sugar, fruit or grain based. Fruit based spirits are things like brandy where wine (from grapes) is distilled down to ethanol. I have a feeling this is grape based spirits. The base isn't all that important since the spirit flavors are pretty neutral.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To make this I would get a very neutral vodka or Everclear (if you can) and start mixing in Elderflower Syrup and some sugar and experiment until you like it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;All I've seen anywhere is that the base is eau-de-vie. Eau-de-vie means different things in different places but, in France (where St. Germain hails from) it basically means any distillate. I'd venture to say, since St. Germain refuses to specify, that it's actually a blend of unaged fruit brandys. If this is the case, it almost certainly includes pear (who's distillate is pretty popular in France).... and if you mix grapes and strawberries (both grown in France) you can come close to something approximating lychee (which I doubt they would ship in). The addition of the elderflower would push the grape/strawberry even closer in that lychee direction. This is all just speculation, a whimsy to kick around over a cocktail. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Realistically, I'd pick up a bottle of high quality syrup (Monin is popular), and use that to replace the liqueur. You want to use less in the cocktail as it's sweeter, but it'll bear the brunt of the work.  You can add a cheap neutral vodka (like Smirnoff) to thin it out if you like. Don't use water to cut it, it'll change the mouthfeel and water down your cocktail. For further experimentation you can use a combination of pear brandy or schnapps (really anything clear and pear flavored) and vodka, I'd start with two parts vodka to one part pear. You'll want to mix the two because otherwise the pear will likely be too strong. Consider garnishing with an orange or lemon twist to replace the citrus in the St Germain. I wouldn't worry too much about the lychee side of things, it seems any options would run pricey. Yeah, your mix will be lacking something but, no matter what you do it won't be quite be the real McCoy.... let us know how it turns out. Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Commonly known amongst bartenders, a remedy for curing the hiccups is to eat a &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/31/style/a-bitter-medicine-cures-the-hiccups.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;lemon wedge doused with bitters&lt;/a&gt;. (In case anyone is wondering... don't eat the rind. Bleh.) Traditionally Angostura bitters are used, although it's possible that Angostura's use is due to availability, for a long time it was the only type of bitters most bars carried. A caveat though, the lemon trick is only recognized for curing hiccups induced by drinking alcohol. I say it's still worth a try, no matter the cause of the hiccups. If the flavor sounds unappealing you can put granulated sugar on the lemon in addition to the bitters. Sugar has a hidden benefit too, it's a known hiccup remedy when taken by itself... and not just the ethanol induced ones.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing this the strongest beer in circulation is a scottish made larger/pilsner &lt;a href="http://coolmaterial.com/home/brewmeister-snake-venom-the-worlds-strongest-beer/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Snake Venom By Brewmeister&lt;/a&gt;, this beer is 67.5% ABV. and is strongly recommended that you only drink small amounts in a sitting, buying a bottle(275ml) of this would set you back a &lt;a href="http://www.drinksupermarket.com/brewmeister-snake-venom-275ml-bottle" rel="noreferrer"&gt;£54.99&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Other than this beer there was &lt;em&gt;Koelschip Mistery Of Beer - Brouwerij het Koelschip&lt;/em&gt; that was 70% ABV but as I'm aware is no longer in circulation and has had production stopped as the brewery shut down &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; alcohol goes the strongest spirit is &lt;a href="http://www.theliquorbarn.com/polmos-spirytus-rektyfikowany-192-proof" rel="noreferrer"&gt;spirytus rektyfikowany&lt;/a&gt; which is a 96% Vodka. The cheapest you will find this is a small bottle(10cl) and  this will cost &lt;a href="https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/28833/spirytus-rektyfikowany-96-polmos-small-bottle" rel="noreferrer"&gt;£7.95&lt;/a&gt; It is is strongly recommended to not drink this neat as it would be damaging &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For myself, I have found that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everclear_(alcohol)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Everclear&lt;/a&gt; is the strongest spirits I have ever bought at 190 proof. Although it is too strong for myself to drink by itself, it makes excellent mixes. Some people have use it to extract the medicinal properties out of plants because of its' strength. It also comes in 150(1) proof bottles too.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everclear_(alcohol)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;A bottle of 190-proof Everclear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The lower proof Everclear is much easier to find and is quite common in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The 190 proof (95% ABV) is sold at &lt;a href="http://www.bevmo.com/catalog/product/view/id/12001" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Bevmo&lt;/a&gt;, depending on your state.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can buy scientific grade Ethanol, usually at a science supply shop. Many of them only sell it in person. It is usually 99.5% or &lt;strong&gt;199 proof!&lt;/strong&gt;. For that extra kick if Everclear isn't strong enough for you!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The strongest absinthe on the UK market. Serve well diluted for your own safety and keep well away from naked flames. The term premium reserve refers to the high strength, with original being the 'weakest' (though still 72.5%) and super deluxe being in the middle. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Please note this is a high-strength product and we recommend not drinking neat – please enjoy diluted or with a mixer of your choice. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Indirect answer  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;95% or 190 proof is an upper end for distilled alcohol    &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Water and ethanol form an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azeotrope" rel="noreferrer"&gt;azeotrop&lt;/a&gt; at that mixture so you can not get more than 95% ethanol with fractional distillation. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The purity of rectified spirit has a practical limit of 95.6% ABV; this hard to pronounce Polish Vodka is a murderous 96% ABV.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hb2ON.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hb2ON.jpg" alt="Spirytus Rektyfikowany"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here are the &lt;a href="https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/28833/spirytus-rektyfikowany-96-polmos-small-bottle" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;details&lt;/a&gt; on the bottle:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;A 10cl bottle of rectified spirit from Poland bottled at the extreme ABV of 96%. This is often used as a base for liqueurs and other infusions, 
					  and we highly recommend that it is never drunk neat.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/warning-over-deadly-spirits/news-story/dc0551387398300ea4103267466fdb8e" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Australia's "Courier Mail"&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;National Alliance for Action on Alcohol co-chairman Professor Mike Daube said it was "amazingly irresponsible'' for stores to sell the liquor, which had the potential to cause serious damage to drinkers or even kill them.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Prof Daube said the extreme nature of the product could appeal to young binge &gt; drinkers, and putting the product next to normal spirits could endanger people
					  who did not read the label properly.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A rule of thumb, two shots of high proof is like one shot of an average liquor. It'll still be stronger but, you can wing recipes by halfing the alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When working with high proofs the trick is achieving proper dilution. Somewhere in the range of 20 percent ABV is a noble choice for a finished cocktail. Often you may want more than 20 percent (even up to 40 percent which is like taking straight shots, easy does it) rarely you'll want less. For a bottle sitting at 96 percent, a 1:4 ratio (booze:mixer) should put you around 19 percent while 3:7 will up you to 28 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Since you don't have to add much spirit to your drink, you can add it to things without changing their mouth texture or flavor too much so, they're good for keeping thick or rich fluids just the way you like them. In my experience, these high proofs don't have much flavor to start with but they do have more bite or burn than say, a good vodka. I would keep the vodka for lighter flavors like lemonade but, this might work just fine for orange juice. I think something like this would make a good candidate for a boozy shake, if that's the route you go I recommend pulling that ABV down past that 20 percent, closer to 12 or 15 percent (where most wine sits at) because milkshakes are big... nobody wants a tiny milkshake.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Fair warning, if your mixer is a liqueur.... if it has alcohol in it, the math below won't work. Don't mix 141 or 160 or 192 proof alcohol with nothing but Bailey's and then wonder why you blacked out, you have to add more non-alcoholic liquid to offset the extra alcohol....&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Now for the math. I got those ratios up there by taking the abv and multiplying it by decimals. So... a bottle with 96 percent abv, if you multiply 96 by 0.5 you get 48, your new ABV. That 0.5 represents how much of your original alcohol is added to the mix. 0.5 is half alcohol and half mixer. 0.2 is 2 parts alcohol to 8 parts mixer. 0.3 is 3 parts alcohol to 7 parts mixer... notice how the ratios always add up to ten. You can do this with any ABV. If I wanted to mix with a 40 percent ABV just start playing with numbers. 40 ABV x .7 = 28 ABV in a 7 part alcohol to 3 part mixer ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I know you are looking for "normal outlets", but for those who are interested, the world record holder for a while was Estonian Spirit aka Eesti Piiritus at 96.6%.  You can still find some for sale at auctions.  I brought a few bottles back when you could still buy it and foolishly did a shot of it.  Never trying that again!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Mixing drinks is an art. This is even more true when one is mixing a drink that involves extremely high percentage alcohols.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Allow me to have a little fun here and show you how to modify a cocktail recipe and I will use Cocoroco as an example. But first:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.artofdrink.com/blog/alcohol-percentages-of-cocktails" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Alcohol Percentages of Cocktails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;When creating a new cocktail, balance is always important. A common rookie mistake is to make a cocktail that has the alcohol content way out of proportion. You know, the one that should actually have the flammable symbol on the side of the glass. Five ounces of Everclear (95% ABV), one-ounce orange juice! The idea being that; it may not taste good, but it will get you “;wasted”. Well, we’ve all done that and realized that there are better ways to enjoy the benefits of alcohol. The best way is in a well-balanced cocktail.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The best example of a balanced drink is wine. It has a moderate alcohol content and the sweet and sour balance each other out nicely. The alcohol content of a standard glass of wine is around 12% with some wines approaching 14%. Some ports and sherry have alcohol content in the 17% to 20% range, and still taste very good, usually because the sugar content is higher. Again, it’s all about balance in drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The full article on from the &lt;a href="https://www.artofdrink.com/blog/alcohol-percentages-of-cocktails" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Art of Drink&lt;/a&gt;, explains how to figure out the math percentages in drinks in a very simple manner and will leave it to the reader to investigate this further on there own. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Now turning to Cocoroco.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.infodrinks.com/hard-drinks/spirits/liquors/cocoroco/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Cocoroco&lt;/a&gt; is the most alcoholic beverage in the world. With a graduation around 96 degrees this Bolivian drink can be highly toxic.  It is made from sugarcane.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The locals often mixed with tea and lemon.&lt;/strong&gt; It is a drink used primarily to remove the cold at these altitudes is considerable.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here I will modify the &lt;a href="http://www.barnonedrinks.com/drinks/c/crazy-parrot-6754.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Crazy Parrot&lt;/a&gt; Cocktail Recipe calling it &lt;strong&gt;Bolivian Naval Destroyer.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivian_Navy" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt; is a landlocked country, but it still possesses a navy.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The following is only an example of how I would modify a drink in order to be able to use a very high percentage alcohol in a mix.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bolivian Naval Destroyer:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Drink Type: Cocktail&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;1 1/2 oz. Captain Morgan's Parrot Bay Coconut Rum&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;1/2 oz. 196 Proof Cocoroco Rum&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;2 oz. Pineapple Juice&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;1 1/2 oz. Cranberry Juice&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Instructions:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Combine over ice in a cocktail glass. Pour the cranberry on last to get a pretty mixture of color. Garnish with a cherry.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not all types of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tequila" rel="noreferrer"&gt;tequila&lt;/a&gt; contain a tequila worm. The tequila worm or as it should be known as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezcal_worm" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Mezcal worm&lt;/a&gt; is normally only found in Mezcal (tequila). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The worm is reserved for a drink known as Mezcal, which, according to some, is tequila’s big brother. But the two spirits are entirely different. Tequila is distilled from any number of natural Mexican plants and can bear the name as long as the finished product consists of at least 51% agave. Mezcal must be 100% agave. - &lt;a href="http://www.flask.com/should-you-eat-the-tequila-worm/#.WLIr3_bTkdU" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Should You Eat the Tequila Worm?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most people would not eat the mezcal worm, but in some cultures it is quite acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;There are no proven side effects that come with consuming a Tequila worm. While the worm is popularly called the tequila worm, it is only found on the bottom of a bottle of mezcal, a variety of tequila obtained from distilling blue agave and similar plants. The meriposa worm is grown on agave from which mezcal is made, and when a worm is added to the mezcal, it is known as mezcal con gusano.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Consuming the worm after drinking mezcal is a popular tradition among many communities, but it is not clear where the tradition originated. Some believe that the adding the worm in a bottle of mezcal signifies the purity of the alcohol, as it hinders the disintegration of the worm. Others believe that it is merely a marketing strategy among Mexican liquor producers.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;While it's documented in media that the eating the worm causes hallucinations, this has yet to be medically proven. The worm is pickled in alcohol for more than a year and is made sure to be free to pesticides, before being added to mezcal. It is also a popular delicacy in Mexican restaurants, and is said to have positive psychological effects. - &lt;a href="https://www.reference.com/food/happens-someone-eats-tequila-worm-8c5ced1d2066f034#" rel="noreferrer"&gt;What happens when someone eats a Tequila worm?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for myself, I think I will pass on this offer!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking worms would be found in a drink called mescal or mezcal (same thing), and not in tequila. &lt;a href="http://mezcalphd.com/2012/08/tequila-vs-mezcal/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Mezcal is related to tequila&lt;/a&gt;, but not as well known outside of Mexico, which is why the worm in tequila myth started.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are two types of worms you can find in mezcal. The white worm is a larva of the beetle &lt;a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;amp;sl=es&amp;amp;u=https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scyphophorus_acupunctatus&amp;amp;prev=search" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Scyphophorus Acupunctatus&lt;/a&gt;. The red worm, the taster one, is a larva of the moth &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comadia_redtenbacheri" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Comadia Redtenbacheri&lt;/a&gt; from the Cossidae family of moths. They both invade agave plants (what tequila and mezcal are made from), which is why those are the worms that go in the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Choosing whether to eat it or not is entirely up to you. On the one hand, the mezcals that have a worm in the bottle are usually bad. It first appeared in bottles around the 1940's or 50's, likely as a marketing gimmick, so it's not some ancient tradition. Opposed to what some people claim it won't get you drunk, you won't hallucinate, and it won't make you horny. The booze is good enough at that stuff anyway. On the other hand, it does actually &lt;a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/that-worm-at-the-bottom-of-your-mezcal-isnt-a-lie-1" rel="noreferrer"&gt;change the mezcal's chemistry&lt;/a&gt; so you can't prove it's in there only for marketing. Both types of worm are eaten even when they aren't alcohol soaked, there are worm tacos and &lt;a href="http://www.foodrepublic.com/2016/05/03/what-is-sal-de-gusano-a-k-a-worm-salt-and-how-do-you-use-it/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;sal de gusano&lt;/a&gt; (gusano meaning worm so, worm salt). In Naturalis Historia, Pliny the Elder wrote that larvae, fattened up with flour, was one of the most delicate dishes and highly appreciated by Romans. In fact the larvae that Pliny wrote about may be of the same Cossidae family as the red mezcal worm. This book was written around 70 AD.... so there is some ancient history there after all. Most importantly though.... it's kind of fun. You get to say you ate the worm, most people won't. (Chants... dooo it, doooo it, doooo it.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The best advice is to adjust the quantity of the spirit to the percentage of alcohol it contains.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Assuming you drink responsibly, i can assure you that even a 91% spirit can be tasted and enjoyed like a pint of beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;EDIT: As always, i think i can let the personal experience talks, i tried one of the most powerful alcoholemic recipe i can in Italy, &lt;a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/it/Gocce_Imperiali" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Gocce imperiali&lt;/a&gt; and i can assure that if the sip is like 4/5 drops, is enjoyable&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your question is a bit broad because the flavour of high ABV spirits, and the intention of the spirits themselves vary widely.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some alcohols with a high ABV, such as Hungarian Palinka, are sometimes drunk purely for inebriation. They have a high alcohol content mainly to cause the intended effects, not to produce a pleasing drink. These types of spirits are also often flavourless and used to make cocktails with alcohol content.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I've had Scotches that were as high as 60% but very easily drunk neat, and quite pleasing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So in sum: whether and how someone enjoys a high ABV spirit really depends on the spirit and it's individual qualities.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Pieces of lime are slightly denser than a mixture of water and alcohol, and so they will naturally sink at first. However, they also encourage carbon dioxide gas to come out of solution and form bubbles by making the liquid around the fruit more acidic (and thereby reduce the amount of dissolved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that it can hold). Unlike bubbles that form on the side of a glass and then detach, these bubbles will stick to the fruit and cause it to float to the surface. When sufficient bubbles have burst, the fruit sinks to the bottom again, and the cycle is repeated until no more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will come out of solution.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, I am answering &lt;em&gt;assuming&lt;/em&gt; you want to stick with single malts rather than go blended. Also because people live in different parts of the world, prices may vary.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would recommend Glenfiddich 12-y as a standard go to single malt and usually a bit cheaper than the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Other good brands include Dalwhinnie and Dalmore(this one being my personal favorite) but these prices will range around the same as your Aberlour.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I've once thought about getting cheaper single malts but I have never tasted a good cheap single malt. Were they decent? A few, most were not the greatest and I would not buy again. This has been my personal experience.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Are you looking for a single malt? Those may be a little more expensive. A blend like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Famous_Grouse" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Famous Grouse&lt;/a&gt; will include good scotches from the region including Glenturret. If you are looking for something a bit smokier, I am a fan of &lt;a href="http://thewhiskeyjug.com/scotch-whiskey/talisker-storm-review/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Talisker Storm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;St. Germain is made from liqueur flavored with Elderflower.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As soon as the flowers reach the collection station, they are immediately macerated using a “secret” family technique, which is said to give them the best flavor, while not being too bitter, too sweet or as inconsistent as other methods, such as freeze drying or pressing the flowers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These are then infused into eau-de-vie (Unaged Brandy), although this part of the process is not well elucidated by the company. The spirit is then sweetened lightly, but is said to contain less sugar than a typical liqueur. The liqueur is then bottled.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Since st. germain is made without any preservatives, it is recommended that you use the bottle within 6 months of opening.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The problem you have is implied in the question: 'affordable' and 'good' Scotch don't really go hand in hand, depending on what you mean by affordable. It's not a matter of brands, it's a matter of the average entry-point for a quality product, which is surprisingly consistent. If a distillery produces a good whisky, they are going to price it according to it's quality.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In Canada, you can typically expect any bottle that costs over about 65 CDN to be what I'd call a good, drinkable Scotch. A good metric to go by is the price of a Glenmorangie Original, or Aberlour 12. These are two starter Scotches, and most bottles at or above their price point will be what I'd call a decent whisky.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Once you get under the prices of those two bottles you'll start seeing a hit in quality, and if you get significantly lower, like 30-40 you're talking an entire tier down.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said &lt;strong&gt;one recommendation&lt;/strong&gt; to look into is 'McClelland's'. It's most certainly not a premium Scotch, but it does perform well above it's price point.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another recommendation&lt;/strong&gt; I'd make is if entry-level and above Scotches are too expensive for you then check out some bourbon and Irish whiskies. Black Bush, Writer's Tears, and Bulleit Bourbon or Rye are quite drinkable whiskies for a much better price.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;FWIW, I'd also hazard against the Glenfiddich 12 recommendation above, it is affordable but is a notoriously weak Scotch.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here are some hard alcohol risks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hard Alcohol Risks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Hard alcohol consumption is contraindicated in certain segments of the population because of the latter’s higher susceptibility to the effects of the beverage. For instance, individuals who have difficulty sleeping, or suffer from depression or other mental disorders, are advised against intake as the psychoactive mechanism of the drink can further worsen said conditions. Consumption is also strongly advised against in pregnant women as it can lead to severe gross motor development, fetal alcohol syndrome, and sudden infant death syndrome, to name a few, in children who got exposed to hard alcohol in the womb. Persons who have to deal with chronic gastrointestinal disorders like irritable bowel syndrome have to steer clear as intake can severely aggravate the conditions as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;This beverage has a substantial concentration of ethanol per volume as well. Excess ethanol consumption inflicts sever damage to the liver and can bring about scarring or cirrhosis, inflammation or alcoholic hepatitis, and even cancer of said organ. This type of alcohol is associated with other cancers such as those afflicting the mouth and pharynx, the bowels, the breasts, the prostate, and the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Hard alcohol has a powerful diuretic effect as well. Because this is the case, individuals who have diarrhea, renal problems, or other medical conditions that are prone to severe dehydration must avoid consumption of this drink as well. Such fluid-draining effect of hard alcohol can instigate premature wrinkling of the skin due to dehydration, and may increase the frequency and severity of dermatological allergies like psoriasis and eczema. - &lt;a href="http://superhumancoach.com/negative-effects-of-hard-alcohol/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Secrets of the Superhuman Food Pyramid: Negative Effects of Hard Alcohol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These are just the tip of the iceberg, for drinking those extremely high levels of alcohol could lead to alcohol poisoning very fast and thus cause unconsciousness or even worse, death.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Alcohol overdosing is nothing unusual. It’s hard to come across anything beyond 40 percent at bars (unless on demand) because the higher the ABV (alcohol by volume), the higher are your chances of you getting knocked out. But still, there exists a dark land of spirits where ABV can go up to a suicidal 96 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spirytus Rektyfikowany (96% Alcohol)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The purity of rectified spirit has a practical limit of 95.6% ABV; this hard to pronounce Polish Vodka is a murderous 96% ABV. &lt;strong&gt;In short, abusing this drink can literally make you meet God!&lt;/strong&gt; Spirytus is actually more potent than the widely-known Everclear and sits atop as the world’s strongest alcoholic beverage. -  &lt;a href="http://www.mensxp.com/health/addiction/27309-10-alcoholic-drinks-so-strong-they-can-knock-out-the-manliest-of-you.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;10 Alcoholic Drinks So Strong They Can Knock Out The Manliest Of You&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is indeed a EU &lt;a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02008R0110-20090120" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Regulation No 110/2008&lt;/a&gt; about "&lt;em&gt;the definition, description, presentation, labelling and the protection of geographical indications of spirit drinks&lt;/em&gt;" which prescribes the minimal ABV for different spirits and it happens to be about 40%. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;the minimum alcoholic strength by volume of rum shall be 37,5 %.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;the minimum alcoholic strength by volume of &lt;em&gt;whisky&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;whiskey&lt;/em&gt; shall be 40 %.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;the minimum alcoholic strength by volume of vodka shall be 37,5 %.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;with the exception of ‘&lt;em&gt;Korn&lt;/em&gt;’, the minimum alcoholic strength by volume of grain spirit shall be 35 %.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;the minimum alcoholic strength by volume of wine spirit shall be 37,5 %.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;and some more.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Mendeleev#Vodka_myth" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Vodka myth&lt;/a&gt; may be of interest for you too.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for affordable single-malts, I can recommend: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Deanston, Cardhu 12, Glenfarclas Heritage and some of the Glenfiddich's whiskeys.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another great Whiskey that I can recommend is "Jameson Black barrel".
					This is an Irish whiskey but it tastes different from most traditional Irish whiskeys. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'd say yes, but with the caveat that I've only tried a limited number of Irish whiskies (mostly big name brands) and so they might be a bit more varied than I'm aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm largely ignorant of what goes into the distilling process of both Irish whisky and Scotch, but what I notice as a taster is that Irish whisky is often very sweet, with more like a sugary or fruity taste to it. I'd normally recommend them to people with a sweet-tooth.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Scotch can be very sweet too, but I find the Sherry versions often with more of a butterscotch/caramel flavour, and if they're well produced the sweetness is usually a bit more balanced than in the Irish whiskies I've tried.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If one was a connoisseur I'd imagine they'd be able to differentiate an Irish from a Scottish whisky a majority, but probably not 100%, of the time. But if someone was a beginner they'd most definitely have trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So to answer your question more directly, if you were to showcase whisky, I would argue that you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do so with product coming out of Ireland, but that it would probably be more on par quality wise with American whisky, than it would Scottish.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The type of still used is significant. Vodka is distilled using a fractioning column or reflux still as described here:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionating_column" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionating_column&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With a fractioning column, the answer is: none of the flavour comes from the original fermentation. There is no flavour (sort of....)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here's what a commercial one looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ILvJq.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ILvJq.png" alt="Commercial column still"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Or a home use version: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cwlti.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cwlti.png" alt="T500 column still for home use"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm not very au fait with exactly how a reflux column works, but the end result is a pure flavourless liquid. Roughly the vapours travel up through a long column which contain elements that prevent all but the purest alcohol vapours to pass through.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the case of Whisky, Rum, Brandy, then yes they do get their flavours from the original fermentation. They are distilled using a pot still (by law in the case of Scotch and Irish whisk(e)ys). This is a much older type of still, less efficient than a column (lower ABV and less yield); key thing is it retains flavor:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4aBcf.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4aBcf.png" alt="Commercial whisky pot stills"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Or a home use version:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UwzuU.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UwzuU.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The nature of a pot still is that it is less efficient than a column, but it allows much more flavor to emerge. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is possible to make vodka on a pot still, but great care has to be made to ensure the input alcoholic liquid (the "wash") is as clean and neutral as possible, no off flavours from the yeast for example. No commercial distiller would attempt this but some home distillers make do with what they have.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Note that even whisky, which is distilled from dark brown malt "beer", will come out of the still as clear as vodka. It derives its final color from the barrel ageing process.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Re the rums, I think techniques vary but I think usually white rum is similar to dark rum but it is carbon filtered after the oak aging process is complete, which removes the colour and also presumably some flavour.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Me and my son ate the two worms that came in a bottle of mezcal we drank on his 21st birthday, it had no effect on us at all above the drunkeness we got from the mezcal apart from its foul taste that stayed for the next few hours. It tasted like wet rotten leather washed with ashtray juice and would be the worst thing i have ever swallowed. My son made his even worse by chewing it first! Definitely not worth trying at all! Even if it offerd some sort of extra kick or effect (which it does not) I would never do it again. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some people have made the claim that drinking through a straw will get you more drunk than drinking without one. This seems to be a Myth.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Many people have claimed that drinking alcohol through a straw gets you drunk faster than drinking it regularly. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Proponents of the Straw theory have two primary claims.  First, when drinking through a straw, people usually drink faster than if they were drinking regularly. Because they are ingesting more alcohol in a shorter period of time, they will clearly get more drunk faster.  Secondly, a straw creates a vacuum, which eliminates oxygen. &lt;strong&gt;The feeling of intoxication is created in part, because of the lack of oxygen entering us, so when we form a vacuum with a straw, we should naturally get more drunk.&lt;/strong&gt; Additionally, by creating a vacuum with the straw, the boiling point of alcohol falls, and alcohol vapors are created within the straw, then inhaled into the lungs. This gets the alcohol into the bloodstream much faster than normal ingestion via the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, many opponents of the straw method say that although this science is true, the difference would be so negligible it wouldn't even be noticeable.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/30/science/q-a-666591.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; even went a step further in ts Q&amp;amp;A section, writing that "There is no evidence that people get drunk faster if they drink alcoholic beverages through a straw, according to the National Institute on Alcoholic Abuse."  And even the folks at Mythbusters weighed in on the topic, when it was posted in the community forums of their website, claiming that it was "Busted." - &lt;a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/afr3/blogs/SIOW/2011/09/do-you-get-drunk-faster-with-a-straw-1.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Do you get Drunk Faster with a Straw?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Starka does not age in bottles, and has no vintage, so I don't think it can be of any interest.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Tokay ages very well, and 70 years old one might be interesting. On the other hand, I have a serious reservations regarding Richon leZion wine-masters of 1947. I would expect something along the lines of Carmel wines, but less refined. It definitely has a great historic value, because it was produced prior to Israel statehood. Ask your Jewish friends.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have no say on other exhibits.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I recognize Strega. It is a digestif from Benevento, Italy. Flavor can become unstable over time. Used in some modern cocktails as well. I don't have my books in front of me, but it is normally more yellow, from saffron. An herbal liqueur. There's recipes using it in the PDT book and sometimes in Imbibe magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I usually use either Jägdbitters (a Jägermeister-like bitters sold at Aldi) or my family's version of Bärenjäger (which I prepare at home - nope, it's not bitters, but it was also used historicaly for the same purpose), mostly when I feel a cold coming up due to catching rain.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Jägermeister gives a soothing feel to the throat if taken when you're already with the cought, but if taken as a preventive, it makes me feel like a warm blanket was dropped over my shoulders and I don't get the actual cold afterwards. It always works we me too, better than pharmacy bought stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ramazzotti, Italian herbal/bitter liquor. i drink a shot glass full of it when ever I have a stomach ailment. Works like a charm. And tastes great on ice and some like it with a touch of lemon in it as well. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Drink it neat but chilled. &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limoncello" rel="noreferrer" title="wikipedia link"&gt;the author of the Wikipedia entry seems to agrees with this statement too.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Limoncello is traditionally served chilled as an after-dinner digestiv&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would recommend it chilled in a chilled shot glass. It’s an aperitif/digestiv so you wouldn’t want to fill up on it...Separately you are quite right though, it is a nice cocktail ingredient and there are plenty of recipies on your search engine of choice!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is how limoncello is served in the province of Salerno (where it mainly comes from):&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MyxuO.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MyxuO.jpg" alt="Limoncello"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Very cold shot glasses (they're not opaque, it's rime on them).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But I'd rather drink it in a cocktail, it's just tooo sweet for my taste.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I like it as a digestive, refreshed around a few °C above 0.&lt;br/&gt;
					However, making some ice cubes in a freezer (nice to have a few of these special plastic bags in the freezer, each filled with a different liquor in fact), and after having crush a cube (e.g. with a mortar and pestle), adding that "slush" on top of an adequate cocktail (fruity one for instance) plus a leaf of mint, makes a great beverage.
					Do not abuse those cubes… :o)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The sweetness is a little much for me on its own but I find it very refreshing, So I tend to enjoy it as a frappe. Simply equal parts ice and Limoncello and run it through “crushed ice” setting in the blender for a mintute or two. Brilliant summer time drink!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One wine comes to mind and that is the Apera wine produced in Australia. If you do a google search on apera and solera you will find numerous hits of wineries in Australia and Canada making something that is Sherry-like. Sherry is now a protected name place like Champagne, Chianti and Burgundy and can only be used in Spain of wines produced in the Jerez-Xeres-Sherry DO province of Cádiz in the region of Andalusia. Everything else produced in a sherry-like manner has to be called something else. Many have settled on the Apera (a play on Aperitif) name. See the "Protection of Sherry" in the Sherry &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherry" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are several other wines produced in the world using the Solera system and these include spanish Brandy, Marsala, Mavrodafni, Glenfiddich whisky, some Champagne, awamori in Japan and is well covered in your link in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solera" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Old Monk Run is sold in &lt;strong&gt;Canada&lt;/strong&gt;, where I presently reside, but it is not all that popular here.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Old Monk is sold by some retailers in Russia, USA, UK, Japan, UAE, Estonia, Finland, New Zealand, and Canada. It has also been ranked 5th among Indian spirits brands at the Impact International's 2008 list of "Top 100 Brands At Retail Value" with a retail value of US$240 million.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;There was a time when Old Monk dominated the rum market. There were other brands also but none came close in quality or popularity. About eight million bottles were sold annually. Today the sales are a quarter of that and they continue to decline. There were recent rumours about Old Monk closing down but it's makers Mohan Meakin Ltd, assured that Old Monk is not going to be taken off market. - &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/How-popular-is-Old-Monk-rum-outside-India" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;How popular is Old Monk rum outside India?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;sadly don't have a link for this, but had a tasting locally put on by a rep from Pierde Almas.   the way we were directed for a "traditional" drinking was in a snifter and served at room temp.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;He said that you should always start a drink with a deep smell.  to keep your mouth closed and you breathe in the scent, and then open it while taking this breathe so that you go from smelling to tasting the aromas. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You then take sips and let it sit in your mouth for about 10 seconds while you exhale slowly through your nose.   and that as you keep doing this, you will start to smell and taste all the Mezcal has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;again, I don't have any links for this.  just what I was told in person by the Rep.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Having owned and run a winery for 15 years (as well as making the wine, it was a small operation), you should concentrate on Sales, Marketing and Distribution about 90% of your effort. You could bottle paint thinner and with the right sales team and marketing you could make tons of money. I've seen it in the wine industry many times. People will say "if you make a quality product, people will buy it" is not true. Branding, marketing and sales make or break almost any product. Look at the Pet Rock for gods sake!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any spirits that never should be combined in a cocktail or drink?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The short answer is &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But that said, there are some spirits that some might want to think twice about since they have an overpowering taste. On the top of my list would be absinthe and chartreuse (especially the green). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Absinthe traditionally has a natural green colour but may also be colourless. It is commonly referred to in historical literature as "la fée verte" (the green fairy). Although it is sometimes mistakenly referred to as a liqueur, absinthe is not traditionally bottled with added sugar; it is therefore classified as a spirit. Absinthe is traditionally bottled at a high level of alcohol by volume, but it is normally diluted with water prior to being consumed. - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absinthe" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Absinthe (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Chartreuse has a very strong characteristic taste. It is very sweet, but becomes both spicy and pungent. It is comparable to other herbal liqueurs such as Galliano, Liquore Strega or Kräuterlikör, though it is distinctively more vegetal. Like other liqueurs, its flavour is sensitive to serving temperature. If straight, it can be served very cold, but is often served at room temperature. It is also featured in some cocktails. &lt;strong&gt;Some mixed drink recipes call for only a few drops of Chartreuse due to the assertive flavour.&lt;/strong&gt; It is popular in French ski resorts where it is mixed with hot chocolate and called Green Chaud. - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartreuse_(liqueur)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Chartreuse (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally I drink chartreuse and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9n%C3%A9dictine" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;bénédictine&lt;/a&gt; straight, while I will drink absinthe with water and ice. Absinthe is too overpowering for me to use in a cocktail or mix.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the end, whether or not to use a particular spirit in a cocktail or as a mix is personal choice and there are no fixed rules on the subject, so one must be aware of what a particular spirit might do to your recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First of all mezcal does not contain a worm, it's a hollywood misconception and if you ever find one do not drink it&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The average way to drink mezcal is just raw but there are other ways to drink it&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Salt or chilli powder around the edge of the caballito (the tiny glass)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Drops of lemon&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Mixed with grapefuit soda&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Mixed with mineral water&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Blue gatorade mixed with coconut cream (we call it pitufo or smurf)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Pomegranate glucose syrup and ginger beer with ice&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;and a couple of others I don't remember but these are the average ways to drink mezcal&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As you said, many of the traditions like salt &amp;amp; lime are primarily used to disguise low-quality tequila and mezcal. If you're buying a reposado, añejo, or aged mezcal, you'll want to get the full aroma and flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The colder the drink, the less aroma you get. Room temperature is recommended by most distilleries. Using a snifter glass, as Jedicurt suggested, lets you warm the liquor a bit more with your body temperature, which releases even more of the aromatics.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While I certainly know a lot of tequila and mezcal drinkers that add ice to their drinks -- I've been known to do it myself -- we'll generally add a single ice cube &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; taking that first big whiff to experience the aroma.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While there are mezcals that have the "worm" (it's actually a caterpillar or larva) in the bottle, they're generally the ones you want to avoid if you're drinking for flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What is happening is that you are burning off most of the alcohol before you consume it. I can't tell you the exact amount, but it's significant. I would say that it's probably less than 10% alcohol by the time you drink it. That's why you don't have a hangover.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Actually, yes. Though usually not with essential oils. In most cases, as an infusion. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For low-alcohol beverages: punch, some dry-hopped beers, vermouth &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For spirits: liqueur, gin, rumtopf, Chinese paojiu&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Compound gin is an example where essential oils might be used.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Considering the many times I drank Feuerzangenbowle with my friends I can tell you that if the one pouring is disciplined enough to only pour the amount required over the Bowle farmersteve is right and you burn much alcohol in the process. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The "not having a hangover" part of your question though, I can't confirm as it depends really much on the quality of the Rum that you pour over it and on the amount of it that just flows into the underlying jar (if you pour too much Rum on it like always on such an occasion in my experience).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I can assure you that you can get a really heavy hangover from Feuerzangenbowle because the sugar and the Schnaps may most definitely cause the usual hangover effects like dehydration and such.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a detail and hopefully and appropriately informative aside for this topic:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In chemistry lab there are two alcohol solvents used:
					1.  Medical Grade (surgical alcohol) = 95% Alcohol (getting that last 0.57% is very time consuming to achieve)
					2.  (benzene) Alcohol = 98% Alcohol (with 2% benzene still in solution with the alcohol)&lt;/p&gt;

The (benzene) Alcohol will make you sick because of the benzene. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Surgical alcohol provides the most wonderful drunk. It is a body drunk with zero dizziness. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Dizziness comes from the long chain fusel oil(s) (alcohols) in fermented alcohol. Fusel oil alcohols are not present in surgical alcohol. All fusel oil alcohols boil off at a different, slightly higher temperature than ethanol (drinking alcohol). Sloppy or rushed distilling gets the higher temperature fusel oil alcohols coming over with the ethanol. Really sloppy and very rushed distilling gets the first run methyl alcohol, methanol . . . which causes permanent eyesight loss. Long chain alcohols cause much of the hangover effect of headaches.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yeasts produce fusel oils when they struggle to produce higher percentage alcohol levels in wines and beers.

					&lt;p&gt;If you like Aberlour you will probably enjoy other Speysides, some well know brands are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Glenfiddich&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Glenmorangie&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Glenfarclas&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The Balvenie&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Dalwhinnie&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The Glenlivet&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Glen Moray&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;They vary in price and each brand has different years which will obviusly effect the price. Of the above the Glenlivet Founders Reserve and Glen Maray Classic tend to be on the cheaper end of the scale.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can also pick up some really great whisky that isn't from a well known brand, for example here in the UK we have a discount chain Lidl which does a really great Speyside that is really cheap: &lt;a href="https://whiskeybon.com/scotch/lidl-ben-bracken-speyside-review/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Lidl Ben Bracken Speyside Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Will alcohol boost body fat?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That will depend on several things, such as the type of booze you drink, the amount you drink, the amount you eat and the amount of exercise you do daily.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink responsibly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Alcohol can either give you a beer belly or help you uncover your abs. After all, while one Archives of Internal Medicine study shows that people who put back one or two drinks a day are less likely to gain weight, research in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition shows that men consume an extra 433 calories on days they have just a couple of drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;While lowered inhibitions and drink-fueled munchies have something to do with it, 61 percent of the caloric increase comes from the alcohol itself. So, if you're trying to lose weight while still enjoying the occasional drink, you'd better be wise about which drinks you choose. Here are the best and worst booze you can order.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Wine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Red or white, you can expect to consume roughly 100 to 120 calories per glass. (That's assuming, however, that you're drinking a standardized 5-ounce glass. Research from Iowa State and Cornell shows that people tend to over-pour by 12 percent.)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;However, there are some considerations to make when picking grapes: White wine typically contains fewer carbohydrates than does red wine, which makes a small difference in terms of calories, says Caroline Cederquist, M.D., author of The MD Factor and creator of bistroMD. Meanwhile, red wine is richer in antioxidants, and a 2014 study in The Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, red wine's ellargic acids delay the growth of fat cells while slowing the development of new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vermouth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;"A fortified wine with higher alcohol content and infused spices and herbs, vermouth is a calorie saver if you have it by itself—as it's commonly served in Europe," says Georgie Fear, R.D., author ofLean Habits for Lifelong Weight Loss. A 1.5-ounce serving contains a mere 64 calories, and typically contains about 15 to 18 percent alcohol, she says. Plus, research out of Budapest shows that it's jam-packed with polyphenol compounds, which may promote healthy weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Still, remember that if you mix it into a Manhattan or martini, you're probably going to be consuming far more calories and sugar, Fear says.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Straight Liquors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;When it comes to getting the most alcohol for the fewest calories, shots and straight booze are the way to go. "There is not much of a difference 80-proof hard liquors," Cederquist says. "They all have around the same number of calories and carbohydrates." And as calories increase along with the alcohol content, the difference is not huge. For instance, a shot of 86-proof whiskey contains 105 calories and a shot of 80-proof vodka contains 97 calories.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;However, you also need to keep in mind that the sweeter the liquor, the more calories it typically contains, she says. "If you're looking for a lower calorie alternative, avoid the flavored vodkas and spiced rums and go for the original or 'plain' option offered," she says. "If you are looking for a flavor boost, try low-calorie mixers like a flavored seltzer or fresh squeezed lemon or lime. This will provide the taste without the calories."&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light Beers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;With fewer calories and carbs, these are the best brewskis for weight loss, Cederquist says. Many light beers contain 90 to 100 calories per 12 ounces, while extra-light beers pack about 55 to 65.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;However, just don't use that as an excuse to have more beers than you typically would, or you'll undo all benefits. Hey, they generally pack less alcohol, right? Well, yeah, but they actually tend to have a higher percentage of their calories coming from alcohol compared to standard brews. Budweiser Select 55 for example derives 88.2 percent of its calories from alcohol, compared to Bud Light at 74.1 percent, and regular Budweiser at 66.9 percent calories, Fear says.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Worst&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Sugar-Packed Cocktails&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;"Margaritas and Long Island Iced Teas can set you back more calories than a large order of McDonald's French Fries," Fear says. Even worse, calories from sugar-laden drinks come as a sneak attack. When you drink a marg, your body is so overwhelmed with the alcohol content that your body doesn't properly metabolize the sugar. Instead, it stores the sweet stuff as fat.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;There is never a good excuse to drink these and other sugar-filled cocktails especially if you are trying to lose weight or not develop diabetes, she says. Now, if you've got a skilled mixologist behind your bar, you're probably calorically safe ordering a cocktail. After all, he'd never serve up one of these artless offenses.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;High-Alcohol Craft Beers&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;"The last five years have seen an explosion of craft breweries creating high-alcohol varieties, which pack more calories per bottle than you may realize," Fear says. Remember, more alcohol means more calories. Every gram of the good stuff contains seven calories.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;For instance, Flying Dog Horn Dog, which contains 10.2 percent alcohol by volume, also contains 314 calories per bottle, and Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA boasts 18 percent alcohol by volume, but also packs 450 calories into each bottle. That's a meal in a glass. Unfortunately, though, all that alcohol can wind up making you hungrier. - &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/the-best-and-worst-booze-for-weight-loss" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Best and Worst Booze to Drink if You Want to Lose Weight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you want to be a traditionalist, it's not really Moonshine unless it was produced illegally, without all the proper taxes and such. Anything you buy in the store could more accurately be called white liquor, grain liquor or corn liquor, depending on the mash stock.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A key feature of both legally and illegally produced Moonshine is that it's unaged.  It goes straight from the still into the jar or jug. This facet was born of the need to make quick profits, the need to minimize the amount of evidence on hand in the event of a raid, and by extension, get your liquor into the hands of paying customers before the revenuers could find it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Physically speaking, there is no real difference between vodka and moonshine.  Both are unaged neutral spirits, usually cut with water to increase volume and produce a more drinkable product.  The difference is mostly geographic. Moonshine, at least commercial varieties, can easily be called American Vodka, much like Poitin could be called Irish vodka.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bourbon and scotch are types of whiskey and cognac is a variety of brandy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Bourbon is a type of whiskey, whereas not all whiskies are bourbons! The main difference between scotch and whisky is geographic: they are made in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bourbon is a type of whiskey, whereas not all whiskies are bourbons!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.diffen.com/difference/Bourbon_vs_Whiskey" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Bourbon&lt;/a&gt; is a type of whiskey that gets its name from Bourbon County, Kentucky, where it originated. Bourbon tends to be amber-colored, and a little sweeter and heavier in texture than other whiskeys.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Scotch?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The main difference between &lt;a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/30278/what%E2%80%99s-difference-between-scotch-whiskey-and-bourbon" rel="noreferrer"&gt;scotch&lt;/a&gt; and whisky is geographic, but also ingredients and spellings. Scotch is whisky made in Scotland, while bourbon is whiskey made in the U.S.A, generally Kentucky. Scotch is made mostly from malted barley, while bourbon is distilled from corn. If you’re in England and ask for a whisky, you’ll get Scotch. But in Ireland, you’ll get Irish whiskey (yep, they spell it differently for a little colour).&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are whiskeys?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Whisky or whiskey is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash. Various grains (which may be malted) are used for different varieties, including barley, corn (maize), rye, and wheat. Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks, generally made of charred white oak. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Whisky is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types. The typical unifying characteristics of the different classes and types are the fermentation of grains, distillation, and aging in wooden barrels. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Whisky (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brandies&lt;/strong&gt; are not whiskeys, but is a spirit produced by distilling &lt;strong&gt;wine&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Brandy is a spirit produced by distilling wine. Brandy generally contains 35–60% alcohol by volume (70–120 US proof) and is typically drunk as an after-dinner digestif. Some brandies are aged in wooden casks, others are coloured with caramel colouring to imitate the effect of aging, and some are produced using a combination of both aging and colouring. Varieties of wine brandy can be found across the winemaking world. Among the most renowned are Cognac and Armagnac from southwestern France. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandy" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Brandy (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Cognac?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Cognac is a variety of brandy named after the town of Cognac, France. It is produced in the surrounding wine-growing region in the departments of Charente and Charente-Maritime. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Cognac production falls under French Appellation d'origine contrôlée designation, with production methods and naming required to meet certain legal requirements. Among the specified grapes Ugni blanc, known locally as Saint-Emilion, is most widely used.&lt;a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/30278/what%E2%80%99s-difference-between-scotch-whiskey-and-bourbon" rel="noreferrer"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; The brandy must be twice distilled in copper pot stills and aged at least two years in French oak barrels from Limousin or Tronçais. Cognac matures in the same way as whiskies and wine barrel age, and most cognacs spend considerably longer "on the wood" than the minimum legal requirement. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The white wine used in making cognac is very dry, acidic and thin. Though it has been characterized as "virtually undrinkable",&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandy" rel="noreferrer"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; it is excellent for distillation and aging. It may be made only from a strict list of grape varieties. In order for it to be considered a true cru, the wine must be at least 90% Ugni blanc (known in Italy as Trebbiano), Folle blanche and Colombard, while up to 10% of the grapes used can be Folignan, Jurançon blanc, Meslier St-François (also called Blanc Ramé), Sélect, Montils or Sémillon.&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armagnac_(brandy)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; Cognacs which are not to carry the name of a cru are freer in the allowed grape varieties, needing at least 90% Colombard, Folle blanche, Jurançon blanc, Meslier Saint-François, Montils, Sémillon, or Ugni blanc, and up to 10% Folignan or Sélect. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognac" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Cognac (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Armagnac brandy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Armagnac is a distinctive kind of brandy produced in the Armagnac region in Gascony, southwest France. It is distilled from wine usually made from a blend of grapes including Baco 22A, Colombard, Folle blanche and Ugni blanc, traditionally using column stills rather than the pot stills used in the production of cognac. The resulting spirit is then aged in oak barrels before release. Production is overseen by the Institut national de l'origine et de la qualité (INAO) and the Bureau National Interprofessionel de l'Armagnac (BNIA). - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armagnac_(brandy)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Armagnac (brandy)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One last note. There also exists a liquor that is generally known as &lt;strong&gt;fruit brandy&lt;/strong&gt; and is quite popular in various regions around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_brandy" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Fruit brandy&lt;/a&gt; or fruit spirit&lt;a href="https://www.diffen.com/difference/Bourbon_vs_Whiskey" rel="noreferrer"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; is a distilled beverage produced from mash, juice, wine or residues of culinary fruits. The term covers a broad class of spirits produced across the world, and typically excludes beverages made from grapes, which are referred to as plain brandy (when made from distillation from wine) or pomace brandy (when made directly from grape pomace). Apples, pears, apricots, plums and cherries are the most commonly used fruits. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;According to a legal definition in the United States, a "fruit brandy" is distilled "solely from the fermented juice or mash of whole, sound, ripe fruit, or from standard grape, citrus, or other fruit wine, with or without the addition of not more than 20 percent by weight of the pomace of such juice or wine, or 30 percent by volume of the lees of such wine, or both."&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;In the European Union, fruit brandies may not be labeled as "fruit brandy"; instead, the legal English denomination is fruit spirit, which is "produced exclusively by the alcoholic fermentation and distillation of fleshy fruit or must of such fruit, berries or vegetables, with or without stones".&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandy" rel="noreferrer"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; A great number of European fruit brandies have a protected designation of origin, and are labeled with their respective protected names instead of "fruit spirit" ("apricot spirit", etc.). Cider spirit and perry spirit (fruit brandy distilled from cider or perry) form a separate legal category. Some fruit spirits may be labeled with alternative names such as kirsch (cherry spirit) or slivovitz (plum spirit) regardless their country of origin.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;In British usage, "fruit brandy" may also refer to liqueurs obtained by maceration of whole fruits, juice or flavoring in a distilled beverage, and such liqueurs are legally labeled as "cherry brandy", "apricot brandy" etc. all across the European Union.&lt;a href="https://www.diffen.com/difference/Bourbon_vs_Whiskey" rel="noreferrer"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; Such beverages are used similar to cordials, and as an ingredient in cocktails and cakes. Fruit brandies obtained by distillation are often referred by the French term eau de vie.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Fruit brandy usually contains 40% to 45% ABV (80 to 90 US proof). It is often colourless. Fruit brandy is customarily drunk chilled or over ice, but is occasionally mixed. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The answer above nails the quantitative parts of the question, but I'll spend a little time adding a qualitative answer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In terms of flavour and the experience while drinking, Brandy and Whisky are quite similar. If you gave a taste test to a beginner they could easily mistake one for the other.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;At the same time, though, someone who was well versed in both liquors could likely distinguish between the two a majority of the time. While there are whiskies out there which border on cloying, brandy usually tends to be sweeter than most whiskies.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, the flavour profiles for whisky are also much broader. That is, you're likely to see much more variation in the qualitative aspects of whisky than you are brandy.&lt;/p&gt;
