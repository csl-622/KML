					&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://vinepair.com/buy-this-booze/the-9-best-gins-to-use-in-a-martini/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Vinpair&lt;/a&gt; here are &lt;strong&gt;The 9 Best Gins To Use In A Martini!&lt;/strong&gt;  This list is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; in order of best to worst. However, it does offer gin recommendations for various types of gin. Their number one all around recommendation is in fact &lt;strong&gt;Greylock.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Plymouth&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Plymouth is technically both a style and a brand – how’s that for pizzazz? Plymouth is remarkably gentle. It has a sweet, delicate nose and a woodsy, lemony body. You might even get a bit of cinnamon bark on the palate. The finish is quite smooth, making Plymouth ideal for the bare bones martini. If the idea of drinking a cocktail that’s basically straight liquor freaks you out, Plymouth is a great gin to start with. It’s so welcoming, the first few sips of your martini might evolve into gulps. Drink cautiously.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Bombay Sapphire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;This is about as old timey as it gets. Savory, agreeable, and wonderfully cohesive, Bombay Sapphire is a gin that was born to hang out in a martini. While this low-key gin runs the risk of getting lost in fruitier cocktails, it rests perfectly alongside vermouth to create a balanced martini. Sapphire’s traditional botanicals (like coriander and grains of paradise) latch onto one another to make something great. Think of Sapphire as the perfect chocolate chip cookie: it seems simple, but one taste of a failed contender tells you it ain’t.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Citadelle BEST ON A BUDGET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;If you’re at a great bar and ask for a basic gin cocktail off-menu, there’s a good shot you’ll be tasting Citadelle. This French gin is a great quality purchase. Plenty of orange and overall citrus give Citadelle a nice burst of fruitiness without being fruit forward per se. While there are some floral notes to work with here, Citadelle really straddles the line between unique and eccentric, making it a great choice for a more aromatic, flavor-packed martini. Plus, at around $25, you don’t have a lot to lose. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Euphrosine #9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;All right, so Euphrosine #9 isn’t exactly traditional. In fact, it’s like you took the floral notes in Citadelle and pumped them up a notch (or three). Still, there’s enough palatable sweetness to make Euphrosine #9 a happy martini gin. If you’re looking for a martini that’s on the sweeter side, reach for this NOLA-born pick from producer Atelier Vie. You’ll pick up on hibiscus, berries, and sweet iced tea. Dare we say it, there’s something rather flirtatious about Euphrosine.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. The Botanist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Hey, here’s something from Islay that isn’t Scotch! Bruichladdich crafts this interesting gin, which is made from thirty-one botanicals, twenty-two of which are native to Islay. While that may seem like an overwhelming amount of botanicals when compared to the standard seven or eight, The Botanist holds itself together surprisingly well. This is a complex gin, with a floral nose and an herbal palate. We get chamomile, mint, and citrus zest. Because this gin is so layered, you might want to add even less vermouth than usual. When it comes to your standard martini, The Botanist will really do all the talking, and in this case, that’s okay.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Gin Mare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Do you prefer your martinis dirty? Then use Gin Mare. Seriously, this Spanish gin seems to be genetically engineered for a dirty martini. In a rare instance where branding fits product, Gin Mare is a Mediterranean gin made with olives, thyme, and rosemary amongst other herbs. The viscosity of the gin, combined with its garden-fresh taste, makes it the ideal spirit for a martini with just a hint of olive tartness. With this spicy yet still contained gin, you’ll feel like you’re going beyond a basic martini. Gin Mare is a great example of how a spirit can be both contemporary and classic at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Terroir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Made from the gorgeous distillery at St. George’s Spirits, Terroir gin uses local Douglas fir. Unsurprisingly, Terroir gin was created as an homage to California’s natural resources. While drinking “fir” might put you off at first, it seems that the plant works to intensify the juniper, giving us a gin that has classic pine notes. This gin has a generous layer of crisp juniper bite, yet there’s a certain earthiness to it that prevents it from being too harsh or simplistic. Expect grassy notes, moss, tree sap, and of course, a heavy coat of juniper to round this all up. Like Bombay Sapphire, this gin is as solid as a California redwood.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Greylock BEST OVERALL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;This mighty gin from Berkshire Mountain Distillers has received tons of praise – and rightfully so. Straightforward, London Dry, and clean as a whistle, Greylock is a fantastic martini gin. Spicy licorice combined with lemon peel, black pepper, and a touch of cooking spice make Greylock both approachable and complex. Greylock will add lip-smacking flavor to your martini while still boasting enough unique spiciness to make your cocktail truly special. A hint of sugar-coated juniper berry will give way to just enough sweetness to make your martini quaffable as can be. This is an A+ gin for making martinis – we guarantee your guests will be happy with this crowd-pleaser.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Dorothy Parker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Named after satirical poet and general snark icon Dorothy Parker, this gin from New York Distilling Company would make Ms. Parker proud. Similar to Euphrosine #9, the floral nose is rich with hibiscus, elderflower, pear, and cranberries. The juniper peaks its head around on the blooming palate and the finish, which is zesty. While this is half a world away from Greylock, it’s perfect if you’re looking to whip up a martini that’s a little lighter, bubblier, and of course, a bit more tart – like Ms. Parker herself.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Recommendation are always a hard subject to put across to others because what one person may enjoy, another may find less than favorable!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/drinks/how-to/a1560/martini-gins/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Town and Country Magazine&lt;/a&gt; offers their &lt;strong&gt;5 of the Best Gins for a Classic Martini.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boodles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanqueray&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. George&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aviation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire Mountain Distillers Greylock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally I am a fan of &lt;strong&gt;Beefeater&lt;/strong&gt; as is seen &lt;a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/04/best-gin-for-a-martini-cocktail-taste-test-fords-beefeater-bombay-plymouth.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;The Best Gin for a Martini!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford's Gin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beefeater&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bombay Dry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plymouth Gin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bombay Sapphire&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2014/04/charcuterie-pairing-spirits-cocktails-advice-jeff-faile-partisan-dc.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;This link&lt;/a&gt; has decent information on pairing spirits. The problem for giving generalizations becomes differences in palate. Most people don't pair straight spirits with foods as most (self injected word) people reading websites for pairings drink spirits in "cocktail" format.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Information from the website includes:  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RYE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Faile recommends pouring rye to cut through the high fat content of fattier charcuterie options. "The tannins and natural spices come through in a rye," he explains, "and a higher proof (100 or higher) is perfect for complementing something fatty and smoked."&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOURBON&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;bourbon naturally complements smoky flavors, but the added dimension of sweetness can come in handy. "Bourbons pair with the same principle as spicy foods paired with Riesling," says Faile. "The sweetness of the bourbon tempers the heat from spice so the heat does not become the only note. A wheated bourbon coats the tongue to allow the spice to come through with each bite rather than building up." &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCOTCH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"The peatiness of Scotch makes it a perfect match for smoked meats, " says Anda. "German style sausages, like landjäger, are great with Scotch because they're smoked with immense depth of flavor and not overly fatty."&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;But finding the right charcuterie match can be a bit of a moving target depending on how the spirit is finished. A sherry-barrel aged Scotch like Bowmore 15, accents peat flavors with a sweetness that Faile says can be great with saltier charcuterie.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GIN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"Being all herbal and floral," Faile explains, "gin doesn't require fat to balance its flavors." Instead, the charcuterie flavors to look for when thinking of pairings for gin, says Faile, "are botanical more than fat." Herbs like fennel and thyme are key points for pairing. "Porchetta's are often seasoned with fennel and citrus," Anda says, pointing to one delicious option. Anda also recommends duck prosciutto, which he describes as more oily than fatty and is often cured with herbs, or a finocchiona, a fennel salami&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMARO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Along the same lines as gin, amaro's earthy, herbaceous, and citrus qualities give it pairing versatility. Faile recommends trying earthy Averna with a liverwurst, or herbaceous Fernet with a bresaola or speck. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have not tasted that gin*, but from the description of the botanicals (&lt;em&gt;"rosemary, thyme, olive, and basil"&lt;/em&gt;) it seems to be crying out for savory rather than sweet. It sounds like a &lt;a href="https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/1665/red-snapper" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;red snapper&lt;/a&gt; would be good (essentially a bloody mary with gin instead of vodka). Also sounds like a classic or dirty martini might be nice, depending on the vermouth on hand.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;*yet... judging by the &lt;a href="https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/12329/mare-mediterranean-gin" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;rave reviews&lt;/a&gt; I will have to try it soon!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Gin is very simply defined as&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;a clear alcoholic spirit distilled from grain or malt and flavoured with juniper berries.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So your differentiation between "made properly" and "just alcohol and flavor" is meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Many of the finest gins are made by steeping juniper berries and other botanicals in the distilled spirit. Others are created by passing the newly formed vapour through a "botanicals basket" prior to condensation. Whichever way they are created, they are still gin.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So all the ones in your picture are "proper" gins. Many of them are really nice (that Caorunn is good.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Myself - I'm a big fan of the Gilt Single Malt Gin, as well as my own gin - the Metaltech (which is only for sale at our gigs.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what you mean by properly, but it seems like you mean "that you would like".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You could try reading &lt;a href="http://theginisin.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://theginisin.com/&lt;/a&gt; and getting a feel for if you agree with the reviewer based on what you currently like, then use his reviews as a jumping off point either positively or negatively.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;I believe that the only truly valid way it to try them.&lt;/strong&gt;  That said if your mixing the gin with tonic(and perhaps a lime), there is probably very little chance you can taste the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Many people think they are alcohol connoisseurs, but in truth very few are -it take real practice and training.  This idea has fascinated me for a long time and working over a decade behind a bar has given me insight.  &lt;strong&gt;It rings true for every kind of alcohol, varietal of wine, and type of beer.  Most people can not tell the difference.&lt;/strong&gt;  What I have here is anecdotal, but perhaps it can help to inform you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I worked at a square bar with a partition in the middle(you could not see across the bar completely).  On occasion we would run out of something, bud light, Kendall Jackson, Patron, Crown, Tanqueray, Grey Goose etc.  If it wasn't too busy, On the order side of the bar, I would make the person something similar: miller light instead of bud, Cuervo Silver instead of patron, R&lt;strong&gt;ail gin instead of Tanqueray&lt;/strong&gt;, smirnoff instead of Grey Goose.  I would let them try it for a bit and then have another bartender ask what they were drinking under some pretense.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Never once did anyone notice or at least speak up, and this happened easily more than 100 times.  Afterwards I would tell them my "mistake" and offer to not charge them for the drink or buy them a round of the correct brand.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Less often, but still on occasion(dozens of times) I would hear someone talking about how only brand X will do and everything else is trash.  I would tell them that I don't think they can tell the difference and that I was willing to make a bet.  Their humiliation against a free drink.  I would fill 3 small glasses with enough liquor for a taste.  I would then put the bottle for their brand and two other bottles of a similar liquor in front of them.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The bet? They have to tell me what liquor is in each glass.  If they can, then they get a free shot(or sometimes more than one), if they can't they have to admit they can't tell the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would fill all three glasses with their favorite brand(never said I would use all three bottles).  &lt;strong&gt;If there was a mixer involved, not a single person figured it out,&lt;/strong&gt; even though a very large portion of players were certain they were right.  If the liquor was straight up, then about 10% - 15% could figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying there are no taste differences between gins- there are. For the uninitiated though, they are difficult to detect straight. When you mix it with tonic(or another mixer) many of the differences are completely lost and only practiced connoisseurs will be able to detect what they are specifically drinking.  Based on your question, it does not appear you fall into this category(most of us don't).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Mostly what you are getting with a certain brand is a feeling from ordering it, not a distinct flavor profile.  In that light, let go of the importance of taste and try to consider feeling. Ask yourself, what feeling are you trying to get for yourself?  You want the bartender to think well of you?  You want to feel like you are drinking something made with high quality methods? You want to feel superior to others? You want to recapture a memory?  You want to seem cool? You want to impress someone?  You want to feel like you are getting your money's worth?  Want to spend as little/ as much as possible?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Let the feeling you are chasing help you choose the right brand.  Alternatively, you could go about tasting all of these gins in order to gain the actual skill to know the difference.  However, this will take years and doesn't have much use in regular bar drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These stereotypes may very by locale, but just as a starting point:&lt;/strong&gt;
					Want to seem urban tough, try Tanqueray.
					Want to seem urban sophisticated, try Tanqueray 10
					Want to seem like you know a good classic, try Saffire.
					Want to show working class grit, try beef eaters or gordon's or rail.
					Want to seem informed or hip (depending on whats available), try Caorunn, Hendrix, or anything local or "small batch".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I expect I may get some kickback from some folks about difficulty of tasting the difference and I say to you prove me wrong.  Perform a blind taste test- mark the bottom of the glass with a label facing down and make sure to put multiples of the each brand in order to make sure you actually able to tell the difference and not just guessing correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiebell/2012/07/09/is-there-really-a-taste-difference-between-cheap-and-expensive-wines/#47d200783ae2" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Also, here is a link to relevant article(for wine not gin) that concludes that people can not tell the difference in brands.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Before going to the various types of gin, I feel it necessary to define a few terms and for simplification I am going to use Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What is gin?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Gin&lt;/a&gt; is a spirit which derives its predominant flavour from &lt;strong&gt;juniper berries (Juniperus communis)&lt;/strong&gt;. From its earliest origins in the Middle Ages, gin has evolved from use in herbal medicine to an object of commerce in the spirits industry. Gin was developed on the basis of the older jenever, and became popular in Great Britain (particularly in London) when William of Orange, leader of the Dutch Republic, occupied the English, Scottish, and Irish thrones with his wife Mary. Gin is one of the broadest categories of spirits, represented by products of various origins, styles, and flavour profiles that all revolve around &lt;strong&gt;juniper&lt;/strong&gt; as a common ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What is a liqueur?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liqueur" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;liqueur&lt;/a&gt; is an alcoholic beverage made from a distilled spirit that has been flavored with fruit, cream, herbs, spices, flowers or nuts &lt;strong&gt;and bottled with added sugar or other sweetener (such as high-fructose corn syrup)&lt;/strong&gt;. Liqueurs are typically quite sweet; they are usually not aged for long after the ingredients are mixed, but may have resting periods during their production to allow flavors to marry.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What is a liquor?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;A distilled beverage, spirit, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distilled_beverage" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;liquor&lt;/a&gt;, hard liquor or hard alcohol is an alcoholic beverage produced by distillation of grains, fruit, or vegetables that have already gone through alcoholic fermentation. The distillation process purifies the liquid and removes diluting components like water, for the purpose of increasing its proportion of alcohol content (commonly expressed as alcohol by volume, ABV).&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; As distilled beverages contain more alcohol, they are considered "harder" – in North America, the term hard liquor is used to distinguish distilled beverages from undistilled ones.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;On the web one can see that there generally five types of gin. However Canada and the USA recognize only 3 types of gin (Genever, Gin, London or Dry gin), while the  European Union recognizes 4 types (Juniper-flavoured spirit drinks, Gin, Distilled gin and London gin).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here are the different types of gins that can be found around the world and what makes them a certain style of gin.&lt;/p&gt;

					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;London Dry Gin&lt;/strong&gt; is what most people think of as “gin.” They are typically very dry, heavily juniper flavored, light in body, and aromatic. To get the flowery, botanical flavor, this style of gin is typically infused with various aromatic ingredients during the 2nd or 3rd distillation process, giving each brand its own unique taste. London dry gin doesn’t have to be made in London and most aren’t. If you’re at the store, common brands include Tanqueray, Bombay Sapphire, and Beefeater. This style is great for classic martinis, gin and tonics, and Aviation cocktails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plymouth Gin&lt;/strong&gt; is a less dry cousin to London Dry Gin that must be made in Plymouth, England. Infused with more roots, this style of gin has an earthier flavor with softer juniper notes than other styles. Currently, there is only one brand of Plymouth gin produced in the world and, wouldn’t you know it, it’s called Plymouth. It can be used anywhere a London Dry Gin is used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genever or Dutch gin&lt;/strong&gt; is very different in color and taste to the other types of gins. Unlike most gins which are made with a combination of cereal grains, genever is made from a base of malt grains which gives it a darker color and flavor that is more similar to a light-bodied, botanical whiskey. Recently, genever has been revived by craft mixologists who are using it creatively in cocktails, but it is just as good for sipping straight or chilled. The most commonly available brand is Bols Genever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Old Tom Gin&lt;/strong&gt; is a sweeter cousin to London Dry Gin and is appropriately names as it was the preferred gin in a Tom Collins. It’s often thought of as somewhere in between a London Dry Gin and Genever. It can be difficult to find but look for the Hayman’s brand. Old Tom Gin is most famously used in the Tom Collins and Martinez cocktails but is also delicious in a Ramos Gin Fizz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New American or International Style Gin&lt;/strong&gt; is an umbrella term used to refer to all of the new styles of gin that use the same base distilling process but are predominantly infused with flavors other than juniper berries. The most common one you might be familiar with is Hendrick’s, flavored with cucumber and rose. - &lt;a href="http://noshon.it/tips/the-different-types-of-gin/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The 4 (and Maybe 5) Types of Gin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ul&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A sixth type of gin is the &lt;strong&gt;Sloe Gin&lt;/strong&gt; and is considered by some to be a liqueur and not a liquor because of the amount of sugar added to it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sloe Gin&lt;/strong&gt;: A historic style, with neither legal nor geographic protection, sloe gin is a flavored gin, using sloe, or blackthorn, berries, along with sugar. Sloe gin is more of a fruit cordial or a liqueur than it is a true gin, and in fact, some bottom-shelf sloe gins are made not with gin at all but with vodka. - &lt;a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2012/06/gin-history-production-types-of-gin-london-dry-vs-old-tom-plymouth-how-gin-is-made.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Serious Eats Guide to Gin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
