					&lt;p&gt;Apart from the simple explanation of people liking the foam, the lack of head could indicate problems with the beer.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could mean that the glass is dirty, or there is left over soap residue on the glass.  This can affect the taste of the beer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could indicate that the beer has lost its carbonation (the head being formed by the gas quickly coming out of solution in the beer).  For many forms of storage a lack of internal pressure will indicate that they are no longer sealed properly, which makes it easier for infections to enter the beer or for it to oxidise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for the ideal amount of head, to some extent it will depend on the style of beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, a good head helps release the aromas of the beer, especially the hops. Aroma is everything for enjoyment of a good brew. When enjoying a super-hoppy IPA, you should always use a glass that provides a large surface area for aromatics to rise from.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It can also provide the a pleasant mouth feel. Stouts definitely benefit from a thick, silky head.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And lastly, it's eye candy.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for the right amount of head, it varies. Generally in an average pint glass you want 1-2 finger-widths of head. Some hefeweizens and wit beers are best with a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With regards to the beer, 4 things primarily determine the amount and consistency of head:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Types of malt used: light malt typically produces larger, more dish-soapy bubbles. Roasted or dark malts will typically produce smaller bubbles. The proteins in the malt are what determine the consistency of the bubbles. There are additives that can alter and enhance the head forming capabilities of the beer. These are usually forms of protein. One of the best silky mouth feel beers I've ever had is Flying Dog Pearl Necklace Oyster Stout. Yes - they actually add oysters to the brew. The protein makes for an amazing feel.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Amount of carbonation: pretty self explanatory. Mo' gas, mo' bubbles. Higher ABV beers and very malty beers can sometimes hold almost no CO2. Give these a rough pour to produce a decent head.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Type of carbonation: CO2 produces larger bubbles while nitrogen produces very fine small bubbles which gives Guinness its famous silky creamy head.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Conditioning &amp;amp; storage: bottle conditioned beer will hold more CO2 and have a different head and mouth feel and coarser bubbles. kegs carbonated by pressurizing with CO2 will hold less and be a bit foamier.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With regards to the pour, if less head is desired, tilt the glass at least 45 degrees and pour slowly, on the glass, rising as you pour to always be pouring just above the level of the beer. For more head, well... dump 'er in.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The glass will make a difference too. For some high-browed beer-snobbery about cleaning your beer glasses: &lt;a href="http://byo.com/porter/item/425-can-you-explain-the-dos-and-donts-of-cleaning-beer-glasses"&gt;http://byo.com/porter/item/425-can-you-explain-the-dos-and-donts-of-cleaning-beer-glasses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes, beer is indeed generally supposed to have a head.  The foam can add to both the flavor and the texture of your beer.  It is preference for sure, and if you don't like it, then you don't like it, but I'd encourage you to try it from time to time with an open mind.  The head of a beer is quite complex, consisting of proteins that are acted on by the hops, the yeast, and the carbonation. Because of the complexity, creating the perfect recipe for foam in a beer is something the brewers spend quite a lot of time and energy on, and it's a fairly integral part of a good beer. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Note that there are exceptions. Truly non-carbonated beer, like Samuel Adams Utopias will not have a head. Hever, from what I've read, that specific example is probably more closely comparable to a fortified wine than a common beer in any case.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer is typically supposed to have a head of about 1/2 inch. This enhances the flavor and gives off an aroma that will add to the experience. A good bartender should give you a nice head on your beer unless you ask for your beer sans head. You should not be getting a glass half full of foam.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some brewers (I know Guinness specifically, but I'm sure there are others) even have special glasses and pouring procedures to give their beer the perfect head. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you try a beer with a head, try not to look down into your beer, but instead look straight ahead and bring your glass to your mouth with your elbow out. This will keep you from getting a mouth full of foam, and is how you are supposed to drink most beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This isn't the "best" answer but a dab of soap (think back to grade school science) with help break up the bubbles and bring that head down real fast&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Soap is absolutely the worst thing you could do I guess :P.
					Sometimes I notice that badly dried glasses (with soap rests) produce more foam...
					In general, make sure your glass is spotlessly clean. You could then either leave it dry or make it a little wet, works sometimes...
					Keep your glass diagonal to make sure the liquid touches the glass almost parallel to the glass' inner side.
					Then when pouring, make sure you have a slow and fluent ray of beer that doesn't splash out of your bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You were right to lower the temperature. Beer (or any liquid for that matter) is better at retaining gasses at lower temperatures. Therefore: cold beer = less gas released = less foam produced. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Occam's Razor says your keg is probably warm. I'd check if your temperature is correct. Make sure the temperature is being checked from the bottom of the keg, as this is where your beer is coming from. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm assuming you're pouring properly, (this includes using a clean, unfrozen glass with a smooth interior).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, I'd make sure all the parts of your system are clean and in good working order.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a few things you can check with you keg.  You said it's a home built system, yes?  So is this a mini-fridge conversion, chest freezer/keezer conversion, or some other kit?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what length are the beer lines?  Generally you need to balance CO2 pressure against beer lines to avoid consistently foamy pours.  If your system isn't properly balanced the beer will always be foamy, on every pour.  I have 5-6 foot lines in my kegerator and it works pretty well for me, when I was having foamy pour problems everyone suggested replacing them with 10 foot lines just to make damn sure the pour wasn't too violent.  Also making sure the lines are clean.  Any beer stone or other sediment in the lines is going to cause foam.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Serving warmer with lower CO2 would also be a better step.  One frustrating thing about these sorts of adjustments is that it takes time for equilibrium to be hit.  So if you lower the CO2 pressure, the headspace is still pressurize.  You'll need to vent the keg via the pressure release valve.  Same deal with raising the temperature.  Once the beer actually comes up to the new temp, there will have been CO2 driven out of solution that you need to vent from the headspace via the pressure release valve.  It's a pain.  Regulators will also often have their own pressure valve, which you should poke and vent slightly when setting the pressure...especially when coming down since excess pressure in the system is going to mess with the reading.  So vent, watch it rise to the actual pressure, then adjust, vent again, and watch.  It takes some time but generally once you set it there's very little change required.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's hard to tell without seeing the speed of your pour.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Definitely check the keg temperature itself.  As a homebrewer I reuse kegs, so I have stickers on all my kegs that have a little temperature line.  These liquid crystal thermometers, like &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00026Z4PS" rel="nofollow" title="this one"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, are pretty cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can also check the ambient temperature using a regular thermometer and a small glass of water.  You should check temperature at multiple spots inside the kegerator, so you could fill some tumblers or shot glasses with water and place them at the bottom of the kegerator, then maybe on top of the keg, and then maybe a back shelf if you have anything like that.  This lets you know if you have any hot spots which you can reduce by reorganizing tubes or tossing a small computer case fan in there.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, if you haven't disabled the dome light in the fridge, do so or find some way to make sure the switch stays down beyond a doubt.  When I first built my kegerator I was getting incredibly foamy pours and a huge contributor wound up being the dome light kept coming on and heating up the tops of the kegs and the beer in my lines.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another final check is the temperature inside of the tower.  If you have no way for the cold air to get from the body of the fridge into the tower the lines in the tower will get warm and cause foamy beer, though if the CO2 pressure is set correctly, this would likely only result in the first 1-2 pours being foamy, then it calms down until the lines warm back up.  A lot of people will put fans or run copper tubes up the towers.  I filled mine with insulation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I had an opportunity to visit the Heineken Brewery on a trip to Amsterdam. During my tour, our bartender was able to give a succinct and general answer: to protect the beer, it's flavor and aroma. If you like, you can read more about foam physics and the importance of foam in this dated WSJ article: &lt;a href="http://www.rpi.edu/dept/chem-eng/Biotech-Environ/FOAM/bcbeer.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.rpi.edu/dept/chem-eng/Biotech-Environ/FOAM/bcbeer.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I was in a similar situation as you. I fixed it by venting the keg completely, then sealing everything up and attaching the gas line. I left the pressure off at first though. I slowly rolled it up to about two pounds and poured. I continued to increase the pressure very slowly and now keep it around 8 pounds. It sounds like you are over pressurized when serving.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another something to look at: your beerline. Check for flaws, sharp bends, particles. Check your taps as well, as an imperfection there might cause the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Lots of good, in-depth answers here. It looks like nobody (edit: looks like Soloem did, actually) mentioned the obvious: close your supply line and bleed excess CO2 from the keg. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a keg will come to you highly carbonated and you just have to bleed it. Sometimes you have to bleed it a few times (before you begin dispensing for the day). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As long as you don't have some physical problem with your setup (long lines, warm temps, leaks or something crazy) you're just facing an over-pressurized keg.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I must say that before starting to brew myself I disliked the head, but when you start to deal with low carbonated beer, it becomes interesting. Just bought this weird "head maker" an ultra-beer thing it is really weird, looks like a sex toy, but creates head with ultrasound. Just stick it in the beer and press the bottom.
					With some beers it definitely adds flavor, especially hoppy beers.&lt;/p&gt;
