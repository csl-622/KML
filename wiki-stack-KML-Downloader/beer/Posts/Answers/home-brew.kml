					&lt;p&gt;Hooch means "cheap whiskey" and here is the origin of the term:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hooch&lt;/strong&gt; (n.)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Also hootch, "cheap whiskey," 1897, shortened form of Hoochinoo (1877) "liquor made by Alaskan Indians," from the name of a native tribe in Alaska whose distilled liquor was a favorite with miners during the 1898 Klondike gold rush; the tribe's name is said by OED to be from Tlingit Hutsnuwu, literally "grizzly bear fort."&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;As the supply of whisky was very limited, and the throats down which it was poured were innumerable, it was found necessary to create some sort of a supply to meet the demand. This concoction was known as "hooch"; and disgusting as it is, it is doubtful if it is much more poisonous than the whisky itself. [M.H.E. Hayne, "The Pioneers of the Klondyke," London, 1897] - &lt;a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hooch" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Does she bake? If she does, and especially if she bakes bread, then ask her how you know her baked goods aren't poison. Beer has been known as liquid bread for many centuries for good reason; it contains essentially the same ingredients (with a bit of hop for taste so you may have to term it herb bread). If she doesn't agree that home-baked bread could be poison as much as homemade beer could be then she is being irrational. That leads me to the second idea. Does she trust commercial beers not to be poison? Why? They are made in a chemical factory. This is a chemical factory holding tonnes of potentially lethal chemicals (particularly the chemicals used to clean the vessels but also if you have a bag of barley fall on you it is lethal(!)). Large commercial breweries (Heineken etc. rather than, say, Sambrook's) are even worse as they inject all kinds of chemicals into the natural product to keep it from spoiling and to add fizz. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The only reason why she should be worried is if she doesn't trust you and, in the end, if your mother doesn't trust you to make food or drink no one can solve that.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think the first step in attempting to change a belief of another person is always to understand why they hold that view. That can even help with determining how likely you are to be successful. For example, if her concern is that you may be actively trying to poison her, you're probably not very likely to change her mind. But if instead her concern is just that you may screw up something and produce a contaminated and therefore unsafe drink, that may be easier to handle. But you would use a different argument than if her concern was that you obtained the ingredients from an untrusted source.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To address the latter two options, the simplest way may just be too brew your beer, drink in on several occasions, and then have your continued health be the evidence that it's not poisonous. This has the added benefit of checking it first to make sure it tastes reasonably good (poisonous or not if it doesn't come out well you may want to wait till next time to have her try it).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Attacking it from a more logical perspective, there are a few other arguments you can make:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Beer was, for quite some time, a product that was made more because it was safe to drink than because it was tasty. Not being able to trust their water sources, brewing beer was a way to make a drink that was not only less likely to make your sick but also an important source of nutrition.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;From the research I've done, I couldn't find any instance of someone becoming dangerously sick from homebrew. Maybe the occasional upset stomach or bathroom problems but as long as you're being reasonable about cleaning and sanitizing the equipment an infected batch is almost certainly just a matter of it tasting bad, not a matter of your health.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;A big part of the reason for the above points is that the alcohol produced during fermentation should be enough to inhibit the growth of any dangerous microorganisms. That should hold true for even extremely low ABV beers (&amp;lt;1%).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Unless you're using dirty, hand-me-down equipment and either aren't cleaning it or aren't properly sanitizing it, you shouldn't​ be able to end up with anything dangerous*. Even then you're more likely to just end up with something you don't like. Long story short, if it tastes and smells good, you'll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;* One caveat here: &lt;a href="http://www.homebrewtalk.com/wiki/index.php/Bottle_bomb" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;bottle grenades&lt;/a&gt; are a serious issue and can be dangerous. Make sure you clean and sanitize your bottles well and don't bottle until your beer has reached its final gravity. That said, this is more of a physical safety issue than something that makes the beer unsafe to drink.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are using honey, water and yeast. Then the answer is NO. But alcohol is a poisonous substance if not used properly. You cannot make it strong enough to "poison" you in the traditional sense. Could you poison yourself by drinking too much of it, sure it's possible. But, there are no by-products from the fermentation process that would "poison" you. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To the other answers I would add: point out that you're working from a &lt;em&gt;kit&lt;/em&gt;.  Like prepared kits for bread-machine bread, stir-fry sauces, and spice mixes, your beer kit is designed to minimize variables and avoid beginner mistakes.  If you follow the instructions in the kit, you can't screw it up -- and if you did, the worst outcome would be that you don't like the taste.  (Assuming your equipment is clean.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your mother, not being a brewer, probably has no idea what's involved.  If you explain the kit concept by comparing it to kits she's already familiar with, you should be able to persuade her that your kit is safe.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Perhaps your mom is thinking that home brewing is like home canning, where a mistake can have disastrous results like growing botulism toxin. A little research into that problem shows that one of the common precautions in home canning is to add citrus juice or vinegar to the mixture of food being processed, and that it isn't required for tomato-based recipes such as stewed tomatoes or pasta sauce. Why does this help? Because there are no known pathogens that can live in acidic solutions, and citrus, vinegar and tomatoes all have relatively low pH. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And this is why home brewing is a safe pastime: wort is naturally too acidic to support pathogen growth. Any microorganisms that grow in wort are safe to consume. Most of them will affect the flavor of the beer, and that is why we do our best to control them, but none of them can harm you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Let me see if I can answer your questions. I have years of experience with making beer, wine and mead...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;No, leave the apples alone until fermentation is done.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;No, the alcohol will stop any rotting. Your mead might be spoiled from another source of contamination (remember good sanitation) but as long as there is alcohol the apples won't rot.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;It is advisable to move the mead from the fermentation vessel to a second one for aging. Mead is more like wine than beer and will benefit from some aging and clarification in a second vessel. This would involve leaving the fruit behind.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;While it's not 100% necessary to add sulfites (campden tablets) to you mead, it will preserve and protect it from oxidation. Like wine they should be added when you move it to the second vessel for aging.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The only concern I'd see right away would be making sure you don't lose your deposit if you have a blow out during fermentation and beer sprays all around.  I've not done it in an apartment, but I just use my stove and a wort chiller that attaches to my sink, so there isn't anything in that process that would be a problem in an apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I suppose if you want to use a big propane burner for boiling the wort you might need to check if such things are permitted at your property.  If they don't allow BBQs you probably couldn't use that type of burner.  If you've got the time you should be able to do it on most stove tops though.  And more time to brew means more time to enjoy previously brewed after all!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For the fermentation, ideally you'll want a dark place that's reasonably temperature controlled, but if your apartment has its temps in a reasonable range you could probably make it work without a special fermentation chamber--which you could also likely buy or make if you care enough to.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Can you brew in an apartment?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The short answer is &lt;strong&gt;yes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is a nice read. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;I brewed my first batch of beer in my tiny Syracuse apartment while the snow piled up outside. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Some people are turned off by the idea of small-batch brewing (one to two gallon batches) because they like to produce beer in larger volumes (five to ten gallon batches), and that’s okay—I like beer as much as the next guy, and having a large supply of it is (almost) never a bad thing. There's also a lot of comfort in that many of the homebrewing recipes and kits available cater to the familiar 5-gallon scale. However, there are a number of distinct advantages to small-batch brewing—especially for people living in small spaces—that I’ve come to realize over the years. In this post, I’ll share a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ol&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Your Significant Other Won't Lose a Closet&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;A 5-gallon batch of beer will fill about 50 12-ounce bottles. That’s a lot of beer to store in your living space—even if you are drinking a few a day. And don't forget the pair of 5-gallon buckets you'll need to stash somewhere. At the 1-gallon scale, a single batch of home brew can fit in your fridge (easy access!), and your equipment can sit right on your countertop. Sourcing and storing ingredients is a breeze as well, as most 1-gallon recipes use between 2 and 3 pounds of grain, significantly less than their 5-gallon counterparts. Trust me, your significant other will thank you for the extra space!&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WgYrQ.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WgYrQ.jpg" alt="Brew storage in a closet"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Brew storage in a closet&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ol start="2"&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;The Cost to Produce Won't Break the Bank&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Of course, there’s something to be said for the economies of scale you can experience when buying ingredients in bulk. But as mentioned above, urban dwellers don’t always have the luxury of extra space. And when making only one to two gallon batches, picking up everything you need at the homebrewing supply store won’t break the bank. If you have a favorite recipe, you can scale it down proportionately.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ol start="3"&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;You'll Avoid Some of the Risk&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;For any homebrewer who’s learned a lesson in sanitation the hard way or woke up in the middle of the night to a symphony of bottle bombs exploding, you know it’s a total bummer. But as you scale down the cost of your brew, a bad batch poses less risk to your bottom line. This can be especially beneficial if you’re brewing with some expensive ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ol start="4"&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;You'll Brew More Often and Learn Faster&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;For most homebrewers, it doesn’t always make sense to brew a five or ten gallon batch every two weeks, especially when a brew can consume the better part of a day. But with small batch brewing if you've got the funds, it's pretty easy to routinely pump out a gallon or two at a time. A shorter process means you're likely to brew more often. Home brewing is so much of a learning-by-doing hobby, that this type of iterative process can elevate your skills at a much faster rate. Testing out variations on the same recipe between small batches is a great way to perfect your beer!&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ol start="5"&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;A Hot Plate Could Provide the Heat You Need&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Brewing a five or ten gallon batch requires a lot of water and considerable heat to achieve the right boil. This is why you might have seen some "homebrewing porn" pictures with an awesome garage setup that includes propane burners. We love those, but that's not practical in a small apartment, especially if you're limited to an "apartment-sized" appliance. With small batch brewing, you can brew quickly and easily with as little as a hot plate.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ol start="6"&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;You Can Clock a Brew In Two Hours Or Less&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Just about anyone who's brewed a 5+ gallon batch of beer has spent a long night patiently waiting for water to boil, and after brewing, waiting for the beer to cool to the proper temperature. Although those can be among the most rewarding nights for some, a quicker process is a great bonus for most small-batch brewers, and helps us squeeze in an evening of brewing beer even during a busy week. With a brewing process which can clock in at under two hours from start to finish, brewing small has convenience on its side. You'll need little more than a stirring spoon and your arm to craft a tasty batch of beer. In contrast, the logistical "bigness" of a 10-gallon batch can be a big turnoff for some—lugging hefty pots of water and grain hither and yon is a daunting task. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ol start="7"&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;It's a Perfect Recipe For Experimentation&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The size of your batch does not have to limit the amount of creativity you put into each one. However, the frequency, cost and required storage can absolutely be limiting factors. Brewing small means you're free to experiment with a variety of styles and recipes without going "all-in." With such a quick turnover between batches, you can always keep your fridge stocked with new and interesting choices. Suddenly you can lager your beer without a dedicated fridge, or test out some new and different ingredients you've had your eye on. Oyster stout, anyone?&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ol start="8"&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Cleaning Up Is a Cinch&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;With larger batch brewing, you can easily generate 15 to 30 pounds of wet grain. Managing that waste is a challenge for home brewers living in a city apartment--especially when taking out the trash is already a hassle. Wouldn't you rather deal with 3-5 pounds of waste instead? Better yet, with even a little culinary flair, you can turn your spent grain into all manner of delectable treats!&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ol start="9"&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;You're Less Likely to Burn Something&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Not that you hear about too many homebrewing-related house fires or injuries, it's worth mentioning that brewing in smaller batches gives you a bit more control over what's happening. Coupled with the fact that it's a shorter process, better control more often than not results in a safer brew. Handling big volumes of heated water can result in burns, and over time, large 5-gallon glass carboys can weaken and be quite dangerous when they shatter—not to mention the loss of an entire batch of beer. - &lt;a href="https://www.boxbrewkits.com/blogs/news/25580484-9-reasons-urban-dwellers-should-consider-small-batch-brewing" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;9 Reasons Urban Dwellers Should Consider Small-Batch Brewing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;An acquaintance of mine who did time claimed he used &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Alive" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Five Alive&lt;/a&gt; to make &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;jail brew&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. But then what can you believe from inmates! Prison brew generally does not taste all that great.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is one way to make &lt;strong&gt;Jailhouse Brew&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Pruno is a type of easy homemade fruit wine that’s often made by inmates in prison. Because pruno is typically made with makeshift ingredients, it doesn’t always taste very good. Making pruno is quite simple, but some recipes create the perfect environment for Clostridium botulinum. This is a bacterium that causes botulism, a form of food poisoning that can be fatal. Because of this, you must be very careful when you're making this homemade wine.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artisan Pruno&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ul&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;10 oranges, peeled and roughly chopped&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;10 apples, roughly chopped&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 cup (225 g) plus one tablespoon (14 g) sugar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2¼ teaspoons (one 7-gram package) yeast&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;3 cups (711 ml) water&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 cup (227 g) fruit cocktail&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1½ ounces (43 g) raisins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

					  &lt;ul&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;10 oranges, peeled&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 cup (227 grams) fruit cocktail&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

					  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making Artisan Pruno&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Avmwn.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Avmwn.jpg" alt="Method 1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;1 &lt;strong&gt;Gather your supplies&lt;/strong&gt;. Traditional pruno made by inmates is made with few supplies and the ingredients that are available in prison. But at home, you can also make your own version of pruno using all the convenient equipment and ingredients available in a modern kitchen. To make artisan pruno at home, you'll need: &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Immersion blender&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Wooden spoon&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Large saucepan&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Small bowl&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•One-gallon (3.8-L) sealable plastic bag&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Clean bath towel&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Heating pad&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Strainer&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Cheesecloth&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Large bowl&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Funnel&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Large sterile bottle or jar with lid&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;2 &lt;strong&gt;Puree the fruit&lt;/strong&gt;. Combine the apple and orange chunks, plus the fruit cocktail and raisins, in a large saucepan. Use the immersion blender to puree the fruit until it’s juicy and pulpy, but still has some bite-sized chunks in it. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Make sure to move the immersion blender around in the bowl as you blend, to ensure the fruit is pureed evenly.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;3 Boil the fruit, sugar, and water. When the fruit is ready, add the 1 cup (225 g) of sugar and 2 cups (474 ml) of the water and stir to combine. Put on the lid, transfer the fruit mixture to the stove, and bring it to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently to prevent burning. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Once the fruit comes to a boil, let it simmer for 30 minutes to kill any bacteria that may be present. Continue stirring the mixture regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;4 &lt;strong&gt;Cool the fruit&lt;/strong&gt;. After the fruit boils for 30 minutes, remove it from the heat and let it cool. You don’t want it completely cold, but slightly above room temperature to help the yeast flourish. As the fruit cools, continue stirring from time to time so it cools evenly.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•The cooling process will take about 30 minutes to an hour&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;5 &lt;strong&gt;Activate the yeast&lt;/strong&gt;. Combine the yeast, the 1 cup of warm water, and the 3 teaspoons of sugar in a bowl. Set the bowl aside for five to 10 minutes to let it activate.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•As the yeast comes to life, it will begin to froth and bubble in the bowl.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;6 &lt;strong&gt;Add the yeast and transfer the mixture to the bag&lt;/strong&gt;. Pour the yeast mixture over the fruit and stir to fully combine. Transfer the mixture to the plastic bag. Press out as much air as you can, then seal the bag.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•It’s important to warm the fruit mixture because the yeast will die if it gets too cold.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;7 &lt;strong&gt;Store the mixture somewhere warm and dark&lt;/strong&gt;. Wrap the fruit mixture in a clean bath towel to help keep in the heat. Then place the towel on top of an electric heating pad turned to low temperature. Transfer the fruit, towel, and heating pad to a dark place, such as a closet. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•If you don’t have an electric heating pad, fill a hot water bottle with warm water. Be sure to check on the water ever six to 12 hours, and add fresh warm water as necessary when the bottle starts to get cold.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•The reason you have to keep the fruit mixture warm is so the yeast will stay alive to ferment the fruit and turn it to alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;8 &lt;strong&gt;Burp the bag daily&lt;/strong&gt;. As the yeast converts the sugars in the bag to alcohol and carbon dioxide, the bag will slowly fill up with gas. To prevent it from bursting, remove the bag from the towel once or twice a day and open the bag to release the gas and pressure. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Reseal the bag, wrap it back in the towel, and return it to its dark spot on the heating pad.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•When the mixture stops bloating, it means the yeast has converted all the sugar to alcohol and carbon dioxide, meaning the pruno is ready. This will take about five days.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;9 &lt;strong&gt;Strain the pruno&lt;/strong&gt;. When the mixture has stopped bloating, it’s ready to strain. Place a cheesecloth-lined strainer over a bowl. Pour the fruit mixture into the strainer and let the juice drain down into the bowl.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•To get the most juice out, wring out the cheesecloth with the fruit still inside&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;10 &lt;strong&gt;Transfer to a bottle and chill before serving&lt;/strong&gt;. Place the funnel inside the neck of a sterile glass jar or bottle. Pour the pruno into the bottle. Transfer the bottle to the fridge and allow it to chill for several hours or overnight. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•A large mason jar will work to store your pruno, or a large two-liter pop bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Any fruit juice that will ferment. Apple, grape, orange, peach or whatever sugary concoction you can get your hands on. Raisins are especially good. Prunes. Tomatoes. Fruit Cocktail. Packets of sugar. Maple syrup. Even bread that has been turned into mush will ferment again. The hard part is fermenting it without being caught. Any plastic bucket will do. Ziploc bags. Even the toilet in your cell is good enough. Don't worry about yeast. If you can get a piece of fresh fruit like an apple it will have enough yeast to do the dirty work. Then just like our ancient ancestors, drink it when it's done fermenting. Who cares if it's cloudy or full of chunks, you have one goal and that's to get a buzz...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Friends of mine worked for Aramco in Saudi Arabia. Of course there was not alcohol allowed, but the Americans lived in a separate community and the Saudi police turned a blind eye as long as they didn't catch you drunk in public. People got very creative about brewing up stuff from the grocery store. Apple juice and grape juice were easy to get. Baker's yeast and a large bucket and voila, you had apple cider. Then stick it in the freezer until frozen solid and then drain out the alcohol, then you have something about 30% alcohol. Yum!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I will try to answer your questions to the best of my ability.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your description of your earlier wine makes me question you: 
					Have you used a hydrometer to calculate the alcohol percentage of your earlier wines? &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If your wine tasted sweet after fermentation, it means your wine wasn't finished fermenting. If you bottle the wine and let it stay in room temperature with unfermented wine, then you may create bottle bombs.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparison between wild yeast and adding wine yeast:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration of Fermentation:&lt;/strong&gt; Naturally occurring wild yeast will use longer time than wine yeast. Adding Wine yeast is a lot faster, and will substantially reduce the fermentation time.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taste:&lt;/strong&gt; The taste is subjective, where wine yeast may create a safer and cleaner taste, meanwhile wild yeast and other bacteria may produce 'unwanted flavors' or 'wanted flavors'. Everything depends on what you want. I don't know enough about the specific tastes to tell you here.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol percentage:&lt;/strong&gt; I recommend using a hydrometer before and after fermentation to calculate the alcohol percentage of your wine. Adding wine yeast will eat up all the sugar in your wine very fast. 1-2 weeks, while wild yeast may use several months. Everything depends on how much yeast is present in the fermentation, temperature and how much sugar is in the unfermented wine.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wild yeast takes time to grow into a culture which can eat up all the sugar, where wine yeast usually already has ~1 billion cells in the package. &lt;/p&gt;
