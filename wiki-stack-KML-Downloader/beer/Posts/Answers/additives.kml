					&lt;p&gt;Electrolytes are just dissolved salts, where the ions can help transmit an electrical charge through the liquid.  So adding some table salt to your beer would be a way to add electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/16/why-do-i-seem-to-pee-out-more-beer-than-i-drink"&gt;drinking alcohol will dehydrate you&lt;/a&gt;, so added electrolytes might not actually help.  If you are feeling thirsty after your run, it would be best to drink water (with or without added elecrolytes) rather than replacing water with beer.  Save the beer until after you've rehydrated.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer already contains electrolytes, which are disassociated metal salts (the compound splits into positive and negatively-charged ions.) &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In beer, Calcium (Ca), Pootassium (K), Magnesium (Mg), Iron (F) and Sodium (Na) ions are found in quite high levels &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mineral content in a 25 cl glass of lager or light beer, average values.
					+------------+----+------+----+----+----+----+------+-------+-------+-----+
					|  1 glass   | Ca |  Fe  | Mg | F  | K  | Na |  Zn  |  Cu   |  Mn   | Se  |
					+------------+----+------+----+----+----+----+------+-------+-------+-----+
					|            | mg | mg   | mg | mg | mg | mg | mg   | mg    | mg    | mcg |
					| Lager      | 18 | 0,10 | 21 | 43 | 89 | 18 | 0,07 | 0,032 | 0,043 | 4,3 |
					| Light beer | 18 | 0,14 | 18 | 42 | 64 | 11 | 0,11 | 0,085 | 0,057 | 4,2 |
					+------------+----+------+----+----+----+----+------+-------+-------+-----+
					&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.bierengezondheid.be/index.php/articles/en/cid=14/aid=127/"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to increase the electrolyte level, you could experiment with adding small amounts (e.g. 1/8tsp) of these salts, since they also have an effect on the taste of the beer (so makes for an interesting taste experiment!):&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Calcium Chloride (CaCl) - rounds out and softens the beer emphasizing the malt&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Calcium Sulphate (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) - makes the hop bitterness crisper &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, eating some commonly available &lt;a href="http://www.fitbie.com/slideshow/5-foods-help-replenish-electrolytes"&gt;foods&lt;/a&gt; is even more effective at replenishing electrolyte levels, simply because they contain so many, and is better for you than the typical sports drink that contains a lot of sugar to cover the taste of the salts. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also keep in mind, that beer is a diuretic, so you should drink water prior to and after drinking beer to avoid further dehydration after your exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ginger beer is not just water, sugar, crushed ginger and  yeast. I make it with some spices boilled in water to flavour it, some of it to kill off the yeast if I want it to. KIlling off the yeast makes it an ale ; and cider must have apples or apple juice in it.  That's my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The term "cider" is generally reserved for apples.  There are 'pear ciders' such as Woodchuck that use the name, but as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cider"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; points out, "A similar product made from pears is called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry"&gt;perry&lt;/a&gt; but sometimes (incorrectly) called Pear Cider in the marketing of some producers' products".  I personally can forgive this, since pears are closely related to apples, and the result is quite tasty.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The "beer" part of ginger beer is due to the fermentation process involved in its creation.  In this way, it is more similar to "root beer", since ginger is a root, like the sassafras root used in root beer and birch roots used in birch beer.  The website todayifoundout.com has a well referenced article for &lt;a href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/07/why-root-beer-is-called-that/"&gt;Why Root Beer is Called That&lt;/a&gt; covering the naming of root beer.  If the ginger based version isn't fermented, but is instead ginger flavouring added to carbonated water, it would be "ginger ale"; I have no idea why, since an India Pale Ale is certainly fermented.  Even with ginger products, the differentiation is not really all that terribly strict, as noted by this &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/20/ginger-ale-vs-ginger-beer_n_1438420.html"&gt;Huffington Post article&lt;/a&gt;.  Initially, ginger beer, root beer, birch beer, etc, were frequently alcoholic, but Prohibition ruined that for the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a bit of a side note, the alcoholic versions are making a wonderful comeback (in my personal opinion) with &lt;a href="https://www.sprecherbrewery.com/hrb.php"&gt;Sprecher's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://smalltownbrewery.com/?page_id=11"&gt;Small Town Brewery&lt;/a&gt; for root beer.  I personally have not seen as much alcoholic ginger beer, but &lt;a href="http://www.crabbiesgingerbeer.co.uk/"&gt;Crabbies&lt;/a&gt; from the U.K. is quite good.  Although I personally do not like &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/697/24751/"&gt;Kuchi's ginger beer&lt;/a&gt;, I have several friends who absolutely love it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no way to determine if a particular flavored vodka has added sugar or glycerin!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Unless one can find a particular website of a certain vodka, which states that there is no added sugar or glycerin the chances are that you will have to taste the product yourself in order to know.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The following information is from &lt;a href="http://drinkskool.com/lesson-four-white-spirits/chapter-one-vodka/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Drink Skool:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;If youâre confused, donât be angry. Clearly the U.S. government is struggling with the issue as much as you are. Todayâs science is capable of measuring imperfections in a spirit. So rather than insisting that 190 proof is an adequate minimum to guarantee quality in vodka, other metrics might have been considered in the TTBâs rule-making. For instance, some successful brands add sugar or glycerin to their vodkas to âsmoothâ them out. Never mind that these spirits throw any standard cocktail recipe completely out of balance. The larger question is: why do they need to add these softeners? What are they covering up? If they focused upon good raw ingredients and clean distillation they could achieve the same result. But perhaps thatâs asking too much; it always comes back to economics.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Other countries are demanding that producers note upon the label any additions such as sugar or glycerin; the TTB hasnât wised up yet. &lt;strong&gt;It will probably be a while before those additives are visible on the vodka labels, but until then, taste the stuff yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; If it tastes sweet, it probably is, and you may want to alter any cocktail recipes that youâre working from.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.absolut.com/en/products/absolut-raspberri/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Absolut Raspberri&lt;/a&gt; is just one example of a flavoured vodka that does not contain added sugar!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Absolut Raspberri is made exclusively from natural ingredients, and unlike some other flavored vodkas, it doesnât contain any added sugar. Itâs rich and intense with the fresh and fruity character of ripened raspberries.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;
