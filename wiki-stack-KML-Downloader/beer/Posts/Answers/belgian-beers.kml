					&lt;p&gt;Grimbergen Cuvee Blanche is in the style of a Belgian Witbeer aka "White Beer". There are are countless similar beers that are widely available.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The archetype for the style is named Hoegaarden. The creator of Hoegaarden, Peter Celis, created another beer in the same style named Celis White. In the U.S., the most widely available example of this style is Blue Moon Belgian Wheat.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Belgian Wit / Belgian Wheat style of beer has gained a lot of popularity in recent years and is an exceptionally easy style to find at any well-stocked bottle shop or craft beer bar in the US. Simply ask for that style and something similar to Grimbergen Blanche should be available. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hoegaarden is indeed the typical white beer. They now have a "Speciale" and limited "Grand Cru" which is very nice. May be hard to find depending on your location.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I really like the Grimbergen Blanche and find it quite similar to the "Blanche de Namur", one of my favourite white beer. So I suggest you to try this one ! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If You do enjoy &lt;em&gt;Grimbergen Blanche&lt;/em&gt; You should definitely try out some &lt;strong&gt;Blanc 1664&lt;/strong&gt;. It is light white beer - cold one is best choice at hot summer! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for me, the one in the bottle is better (like all of the beers).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The taste of this beer is not suitable for everyone, some of my friends argues  with "how could you drink this ?". I really do love the rich fruit taste and the lightness of the beer itself. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommending to try.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Abt is abbot in Dutch. You can hear a couple people pronounce it on &lt;a href="http://forvo.com/word/abt/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Forvo&lt;/a&gt;, but in the States I'd just say abbot. The top two examples are German. If you scroll down there is one Dutch speaker. For anyone unfamiliar with St. Bernardus or how a monk relates to a beer, it's an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_in_Belgium#Abbey_beers" rel="nofollow"&gt;abbey beer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the 12 in the name seems to refer to the beers gravity. In the &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=6eRbBAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA302&amp;amp;lpg=PA302&amp;amp;dq=the%20beer%20bible%20the%20essential%20beer%20lovers%20guide%20st%20bernardus&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=FckY1o01Lh&amp;amp;sig=pFad3idMreC46j76f1OTZp6dXMY&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwio2K-I89vPAhVD5mMKHagbCMYQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false" rel="nofollow"&gt;Belgian degree system&lt;/a&gt;, specific gravity is converted to degrees by subtracting 1 from the number and multiplying by 100 (there's a little history on St. Bernardus if you scroll down to pg. 305). So if the final gravity is &lt;a href="http://www.candisyrup.com/uploads/6/0/3/5/6035776/st._bernardus_abt_12_clone_-_041.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;1.012&lt;/a&gt; (PDF for clone recipe), crunch the numbers and you end up with 12 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not knowing much about the beer but the 30 second Google search - I will try to give insight as to why this may happen.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've noticed this was a Trappist beer. As such, there is probably as much yeast in there as homebrew beers that have had sugar added to carbonize the beer during the bottling process. When too much sugar is added at this step, the homebrewing community refers to the disaster that happens next as "painting the ceiling." This comes from the present yeast having too much sugar to eat and over-pressurize the beer. The first time this happened to me I thought someone was shooting either in or right beside my house. I know that the Trappist Monks have been doing things a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; longer than homebrewers; but, the situation is still plausible. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is also a chance for glass defects. Or perhaps, the bottle was knocked over and created a stress fracture that over time gave way with your slight nudge. You could always reach out to Westvleteren XII Gurus and ask what is the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; way to store the beer so this doesn't happen again. Sorry for your loss! :(&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've been homebrewing and winemaking for almost 25 years and there are 3 reasons why a bottle might explode.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Too much sugar for the secondary fermentation in the bottle. Homebrewers do this ALL THE TIME. Turns your beer into little hand-grenades. Sometimes fermentation is not complete and with the normal addition of sugar at bottling can cause problems. This happens frequently in high gravity beers.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Infection - by this I mean something other than yeast was in the beer and started eating the sugar to make the carbonation in the beer. It could be a wide variety of agents from yeast to bacteria to fungus. They convert sugar to CO2 at different rates than yeast. Many times they produce more CO2 causing gushing beers and sometimes broken bottles.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Defective bottle. 99.99% of the time bottles are built to spec, but occasionally one slips through with a defect and many times that can lead to a bottle failing. Also, bottles are sometimes dropped or banged around causing a crack.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Any beverage that is "bottle conditioned," with active yeast, has the possibility of this happening.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In most cases, the yeast will be limited by either -&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Fermentable sugars already being depleted (not all sugars are readily fermentable to brewing yeasts)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Alcohol levels (this is the waste product of yeast) reaching levels that are toxic to the strain of yeast, and they either die or go dormant&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your typical home brew will go through fermentations so case #1 applies, and then they add just a bit of corn sugar and bottle so just a bit more fermentation occurs to carbonate the beverage in the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Other bottle conditioned brews might do an estimate of how much sugars have been used and how much remain, by measuring the specific gravity of the beer (more dense with sugars, less dense with less sugar and alcohol instead).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If their calculations were off, and there was still more sugars that could ferment, then pressure would build beyond what was needed just to carbonate.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I had a batch of stout where the yeast culture I used was pretty old, so it was less active than usual.  The time when I thought it was done fermenting was actually not accurate because of the less lively activity, and my bottles of stout all started exploding in my basement, and I had to dump the rest of the batch out to save the bottles.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I also had a fruit punch recipe that my uncle used for a wedding beverage, using just fruit juice, wine and champagne.  He used a much better champagne than the recipe called for, so there was live yeast.  When he put the leftovers back into the wine jugs and put them in the fridge, they got very "lively", with carbonation, more alcohol content, a bit drier, and one jug shattering from the additional fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's ok to drink. Belgian beer usually has a lot of sediment to begin with. I've aged Belgian beers for several years. Some taste quite good with that amount of age.  It's up to you if you want the sediment or not. I am a decanting guy but not everyone is. All you can do is pop it in the fridge and try it out!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sediment and cloudiness are common characteristics of many beers from that area, they aren't a sign of whether it is gone off or not. It may be okay to drink or it may not, it depends how it's been stored. If it's gone bad it's not going to be poison or anything, just unpleasant to taste, so there's no harm in trying it. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally I'm in the decant crowd, I usually find the sediment unpleasant, however that's all your personal taste. Treat it as if you'd just bought it. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Don't worry about the sediment, most of it will be yeast and if the beer was preserved properly it will still be alive. It's up to your personal taste to add it or leave it in the bottle. When I sample old bottles I listen to the sound the beer makes when I lift the cap, if it's quiet silent the beer goes down the drain.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't age La Chouffe Blonde myself, it's a beer that get's most of it's character from subtle hoppy notes and those are lost once the beer gets older.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can do this just like a bottle of sparkling wine. It should keep the beer for a couple of days, but not forever. Sometimes the corks don't work great, so I would buy a &lt;a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00IFGJL0G" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Champagne bottle stopper&lt;/a&gt; like the one below 
					Don't get the one that hold onto the ridge under the bottle opening. They work great for Champagne bottles but not so good on Belgian beer bottles.

					&lt;p&gt;We've tried doing this years ago, so as for any corked drinks, it doesn't pop out or randomly pop out, but in case you're wondering how it would taste like, there's two diversions of the taste, either the taste would randomly contribute to the corkage of the wine to make it taste better.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;After opening the bottle the beer will begin to oxidize and degrade in quality, so flavor will begin to suffer shortly after opening.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Pressure will not continue to build in the bottle from fermentation, the yeast have consumed what residual sugar is present for bottle carbonation. That being said, the dissolved CO2 will remain in solution at cooler temperatures but escape rapidly as it warms, so capping while the bottle is cool and keeping the bottle cool will preserve more CO2 in solution after opening.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A recorked bottle will be most likely to drive out the cork if allowed to warm, or agitated physically.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A recorked bottle will be less likely to drive out the cork, if recorked warm, and then placed gently into cold storage.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Lastly, volumes of CO2 in Belgian beers can range wildly, but their level of CO2 is generally higher than domestic US beer, however much lower than champagne. Pressure in the bottle will react as such.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If I want to find a beer, I use the Untappd app. Link to the beer is here: &lt;a href="https://untappd.com/b/abbaye-de-leffe-leffe-brune-bruin/5941" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://untappd.com/b/abbaye-de-leffe-leffe-brune-bruin/5941&lt;/a&gt; 
					If you load it up in the App (certainly on Android), you can 'Find It'. This will search for recent check ins close to you. That should certainly point you in the right direction anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
