					&lt;p&gt;Yes.  Taste is really smell, and different glasses can capture aromas differently.  Furthermore, different aromas may be more or less present dependent upon temperature, and a glass may be crafted to be held a particular way (gathering more or less heat from your hand).  The same is true for wine glasses.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, how much of a difference it makes &lt;em&gt;to you&lt;/em&gt; is what's important.  Going back to the wine comparison, I can sometimes tell the difference between different glasses, but not consistently.  So it's not the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; important thing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Now that &lt;em&gt;that's&lt;/em&gt; said, there has been some informal, perhaps less than perfectly scientific studies, including a &lt;a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2012/06/beer-glasses-best-glass-for-craft-beer-taste-test.html"&gt;blind test&lt;/a&gt;.  Beer advocate provides some more &lt;a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/101/glassware/"&gt;detailed information&lt;/a&gt;.  Some of my local bars carry stemware for specific European beers, and I know of one stateside brewery, Black Shirt Brewing in Denver, which really wants you to &lt;a href="http://www.fermentedlychallenged.com/2012/06/black-shirt-brewing-to-feature-offero.html"&gt;stick your nose up in it&lt;/a&gt; (to good effect, in my experience).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I don't think that there is a commonly accepted glassware for saisons in general.  &lt;a href="http://fermentationriot.com/beerglasses.php?beerglass=Saison%20/%20Farmhouse%20Ale" rel="nofollow"&gt;Different&lt;/a&gt; sources &lt;a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/101/glassware/" rel="nofollow"&gt;point&lt;/a&gt; to 3 different types: the pint, the tupic, and the oversized wine (goblet?).  A prticular saison may be better suited to one of those three, depending on whether it was crafted to have more or less aromatic, or just a beer for simple drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Function&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer glassware serves a few primary purposes:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;it is part of the branding of the beer (for beers with their own glass)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;it presents the beer (beauty is in the eye of the beer holder) showcasing the beer's color, clarity and/or carbonation.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;it influences how quickly volatiles (aromatics) are released&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;it influences how much beer can be consumed per sip (e.g. compare champagne flute vs. beer mug)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;it can promote head retention (through the shape, plus small etchings in the base of the glass)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Some examples&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Pilsner glass is a long tall V-shaped glass. It emphasizes the
					color, clarity and effervescence of the Pilsner. It's similar in
					principle to the fluted champagne glass, but having larger rim,
					affords larger sips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The traditional mug is a robust glass, primarly aimed at "chinking"
					glasses together and allowing large swallows of beer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challace/goblet can be beautiful pieces of work, designed to
					showcase the beer, and also promote and maintain a large head. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tulip glass captures volatiles (in the narrow part of the glass)
					while the large opening at the top supports a large head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sniffer, typically used for cognac/brandy, but also for very
					strong ales, has a large base that curves up to a small opening to
					capture the aromatics, and to allow for swirling to encourage more
					aromatics to be released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Stange, a long tall glass, amplifies the malt and hop
					characteristics by concentrating them in a smaller area, while also
					providing a simple elegant presentation of the beer. Often used with
					delicate beers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Weizen glass is similar to the pilsner glass, but larger
					(typically 0.5l minimum) with plenty of room for the large head
					typical of a wheat beer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For more details and images, see &lt;a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/101/glassware/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Glassware for Beer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If your dishwasher uses a rinsing/drying agent (Finish/Jet Dry type product), these products contain surfactants, which serve to reduce surface tension and "flatten" the water molecules for faster drying.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would imagine that any residual surfactants on the glass reduce the surface tension of the carbon dioxide bubbles and cause them to pop, reducing the amount of head on the beer.  Since these products tend to brag that they remain on the dishes after washing to give them a "sheen" I imagine there is quite a bit of residue.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Washing your glasses by hand is probably the best approach to avoid this.  While most dishwashing liquids also contain a lot of surfactants, they are designed to be rinsed away easily.  I suppose you could empty your dishwasher of rinse aid, but I don't know how other dishes would come out.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="http://www.dishwashingexpert.com/dishwashing-basics/dishwashing-science"&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; for some of the details.  I think it's run by one of the manufacturers of the rinse aid products, so take it with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another problem could be that dishwasher procedures could permanently change physical properties of the glass surface. The changes could be:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;mineral deposits&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;etching and corrosion&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;devitrification (crystallization of the amorphous glass)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dishwasher#Hazing_of_glassware"&gt;hazing of glassware&lt;/a&gt; on Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The physically changed surface would usually create &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleation"&gt;nucleation&lt;/a&gt; points for collecting of the released carbon dioxide to form bubbles. See also &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget_%28beer%29#Beer_glass_widget"&gt;beer glass widget&lt;/a&gt;. This could cause faster release of carbon dioxide from the beer and a subsequent change of the taste of the beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would like to point out that taste is not the only important criterion when drinking beer. What you want is a good &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt;, and the taste is only a part (albeit a major part) of that.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Having different glasses for different types of beers can affect your drinking experience in a number of different ways. First off, having an unusual or unique glass can often be very fun, because it's probably not something you're used to. The first time I ever drank beer from a litre mug was a very fun experience for me, and not because it made the beer taste differently. Secondly, I find that different types of glasses encourage me to enjoy the beer in different ways. I find that glasses with stems, which are often used for stronger beers, encourage me to drink the beer more slowly and savor it a bit more than a glass without a stem. I think these effects on experience are one of the big reasons for the wide variations in beer glassware. As a beer manufacturer, if I could make a unique glass that will better help people remember my beer, I would consider that a worthwhile investment.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm not trying to say that the effects of glassware on taste don't exist or are unimportant; I think they are important. But they're only part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When cleaning a beer glass your goal is to remove everything you can from the surface.  As the other answers mention, washing with dish detergent tends to leave an unpleasant film.  It's not hard to keep your glassware clean:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't use beer glasses for other drinks&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly drinks with fat (like milk) since glassware cleaner isn't designed to remove it.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always rinse your glasses immediately&lt;/strong&gt;: your job's much harder if the lacing and sediment dries caked on the glass.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hand wash your glassware&lt;/strong&gt;, not only because of the detergent, but also because the best glasses are made of the thinnest glass, so they're quite delicate.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use a beer-specific cleaning agent&lt;/strong&gt;, a percarbonate cleaner like PBW, One-Step or B-Brite.  These are formulated specifically to deal with the compounds that beer leaves in a glass.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you only ever drink beer out of your beer glasses and always rinse them soon after, you'll find that you can wash with a pretty weak cleaning solution.  I almost never need more than about 1/2 ounce of PBW in a gallon of hot water.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also see &lt;a href="http://www.howtobrew.com/section1/chapter2-2-1.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;How to Brew&lt;/a&gt;'s section on cleaning products.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I think drinking carbonated (with CO2 at least) beer from pewter is asking for trouble if you do it regularly.  The tang you feel is dissolved metal and a component of that, depending on the pewter, may be lead (or could be copper, tin, bismuth, antimony, etc).  A major factor in that is acidity, and both hops and carbonation contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Acidic solutions react with metals to produce hydrogen gas and dissolved metal salts.  So carbonic acid from carbonated beer will react with the tin to produce hydrogen and tin carbonate, and the same basic process with other metals.  The specific metal that reacts will depend on the pewter.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are some ways around this.  You could, for example, coat the inside of the vessel with bees wax.  This can then be washed by hand with hot tap water and soap (and is a common method in making drinking horns).  This has the pro/con (depending on your taste) of imparting a slight honey taste to everything you drink out of the vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You're right to have identified a peculiar flavor coming from pewter.  There are two parts to this: the leaching of the metals as mentioned by @Chris as well as the oxidation of lipids in your mouth.  In my opinion neither of these is particularly pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That being said, when pewter was phased out in favor of glass, there were many who held on to their pewter tankards for drinking porter.  Ron Pattinson shares &lt;a href="http://barclayperkins.blogspot.com/2010/01/porter-and-pewter.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;an anecdote&lt;/a&gt; about an Irish MP who would hide his pewter mug under the table to avoid the critical eye of others in the pub.  Today you might get a similar reaction from craft beer drinkers appalled at your treatment of the beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I found a &lt;a href="http://zythophile.wordpress.com/2012/01/06/caught-on-the-horns-of-a-yard-of-ale/" rel="nofollow"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; where the author has (most thoroughly, in my opinion) gone in search of some primary source of evidence for the origins of the yard glass. Unfortunately, they seem to have turned up nothing definitive.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;On one point, the post is quite consistent: there isn't any real evidence to suggest that the story of the stagecoach or mailcoach driver drinking from the yard-glass is true. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It mentions sources on the history of glassmakers:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The same absence of evidence occurs in specialist books on drinking glasses. The history  of the Worshipful Company of Glass Sellers, published in 1898, has a drawing of the Eton  “long glass”, but no coach drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And also the history of coaches:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Specialist books on coach travel also fail to supply references to coach drivers and ale-yards.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The coach explanation appears to be wholly made-up:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The earliest reference to the coach driver legend I have found is from 1952&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And, inferring from previous evidence provided by the author, this is almost a century after coach travel has been superseded by steam trains.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The author also makes an interesting point; a coach driver was almost certainly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; handed a yard of ale from the alehouse window, because the risk of breaking the glass (which would have been expensive) was too great!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most of the evidence of the post tends to suggest that the yard of ale was originally intended as a bit of a joke, and attempting to drink the whole thing without spilling a drop was a fun game to play.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;When air reaches the bulb it displaces the liquor with a splash, startling the toper, and compelling him involuntarily to withdraw his mouth by the rush of the cold liquid over his face and dress.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To summarise, in one final quote from the most-excellent article:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;But with all that, I hope you’ll agree, we have found no evidence that
					  the yard of ale was originally “designed to meet the needs of
					  stagecoach drivers” in a hurry. In fact, there is no evidence that the
					  yard of ale was ever used to refresh coach drivers at all (and if it
					  had been, it certainly wouldn’t have been handed up to the driver
					  through an inn window, which would be an excellent way to either spill
					  the ale or smash the glass). Instead, I think, it seems clear that the
					  yard of ale was (1) produced as something of a show-off, for the
					  glassmaker and the owner, and (2) primarily or almost solely supplied
					  and bought as a “forfeit glass”, for use in drinking games and
					  contests of skill, just as it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The 'stage-coach driver' explanation seems to be an &lt;em&gt;ex post facto&lt;/em&gt; explanation, almost certainly affected by the fact that a post-horn (sounded by mail-coach drivers to warn tollkeepers to open the gate so as not to delay the mails) was frequently (and genuinely) called a 'yard of tin'. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"The habit of calling the coach-horn the "yard of tin " arose from the fact that it really was a yard, or thirty-six inches, of tin, many of the old horns on the inferior coaches being made of tin, and not of copper or brass."

					&lt;p&gt;First, yes, this is quite typical.  Snifters are widely used for beer and generally for two reasons, in my experience.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;As you suspect, the bowl shaped glass helps to concentrate the aroma.  However, this isn't unique to the snifter as many types of beer glasses incorporate a narrowing throat to provide this effect. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Quantity.  With a glass of beer that has a particularly high alcohol content, or particularly strong flavor, you'll often get much less than a standard 12-16 oz. pour.  The beer you refer to for instance, the Big Bad Baptist, has an alcohol content of 11.8% ABV, which closer to wine than beer, (and wine has a standard 5oz serving size per glass, or thereabouts) so it calls for a smaller serving size.  However, a 5oz or 6oz serving would look rather silly in a pint glass, so a snifter is more appropriate in proportion. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;According to Stella Artois  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;In order to perfectly enjoy the unique taste and beauty of Stella Artois, we created the Chalice, instead of merely a glass. The Chalice is designed so that every curve serves a discrete purpose to how Stella Artois should be enjoyed. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The authentic shape of the body encourages the perfect balance of C02 and liquid, enhancing head retention and flavor. The angles at the bottom cause a wave that works in harmony with the liquid alchemy. The stem provides a means to hold the chalice so that the Stella Artois stays cold longer and it's embellished with a star to honor our history.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;All of these details, however small, make a big impact on the flavor and experience, giving everyone the opportunity to taste a proper Stella Artois.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The first, and primary reason any beer comes in branded glassware is this:  Marketing.  Brewers, like any other businesses, like for the general public to know that the anonymous tapped beer you're drinking is theirs.  That is why they provide branded glasses to bars, and request (or require) that their beer be served in their glasses.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Is there a benefit to the mildly curved shape of this glass for this type of beer?&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In my observations, yes, there is.  While the throat may not narrow as severely as a brandy snifter, the effect of concentrating the aroma is still achieved. Eyeballing it, I'd say that the curvature is somewhere in between that of my champagne flutes and my red wines glasses, which are presumed to have the same general effect.  More generally I'd say that a glass with a narrowing or restricted throat does concentrate the aroma, and the degree of restriction doesn't seem to matter significantly, to my nose.  (Assuming it isn't &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; great, that is.  Beer in a bottle or can, for instance, is definitely at a disadvantage.) &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'd like to also look at a few of the reasons they state in their marketing material as well.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The authentic shape of the body encourages the perfect balance of C02 and liquid, enhancing head retention and flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I don't have any evidence to back this up, but I suspect that this is probably the most legitimate of the claims.  This would have a significant effect on the experience of drinking the beer, it is going to be specific to their recipe, and it's a reason that's often given for custom beer glassware.  (Boston Beer Company laser etches the bottom of their Sam Adams Boston Lager glass to enhance cavitation, for instance.) &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The angles at the bottom cause a wave that works in harmony with the liquid alchemy. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what this means.  Alchemy is the term for pre-chemistry, and primarily deals with trying to turn ordinary substances into gold.  I assume they're trying to insinuate that the glass magically turns Stella into better beer. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The stem provides a means to hold the chalice so that the Stella Artois stays cold longer &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is plausible, and perhaps unfortunate.  This is why you are supposed to hold red wine glasses by the bowl (to warm the wine) and white wine glasses by the stem (to keep it cool.)   However, with wine, a serving is generally five ounces or so, compared to twelve or more of lager.   The effect certainly won't be the same given the significantly higher mass.   The unfortunate bit is that colder is not generally what you want when you're talking about good beer.  Colder is the realm of the cheap macro-brews like Coors Light.   Cold subdues flavor compounds, which is useful when the flavor of the beer is nasty, and not so useful when it's pleasant.  This certainly isn't a a requirement or general best practice for lagers as you won't find stemmed glassware used for Boston Beer's Samuel Adams Lager glass: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DMcwF.jpg" alt="Samuel Adams Boston Lager Glass"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;or my classic Spiegelau Lager glass: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wn6wv.png" alt="Speieglau lager glass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;or any of the glasses you'll see used for the many fine Lagers of Germany.  So, I have to suppose one of the following two reasons.  First, they may simply be pandering to the general belief that colder beer is better.  Second, it would be unfortunate if they were trying to hide a lack of quality by trying to ensure the beer was too cold to taste properly.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finally, and I've left this to last, because it's purely my opinion...I think they've chosen the chalice glass specifically because it's fancy, and that's the image they want to portray for their beer.  When people see the Stella glass, they don't want their beer to be lumped in with the pint-glass styles, they want it to stand out as sophisticated, and the chalice specifically gives it that cachet.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, my top line and bottom line are down to marketing, with a bit of truth and a bit of fiction to all the bits in between. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some brewers design glasses to enhance the experience of the beer in various ways.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;IPAs in general benefit from a large opening to release as much aroma as possible, but there are other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I know Guinness in particular has designed a very special glass for their beer. The &lt;a href="http://www.drinkstuff.com/products/product.asp?ID=6480#.VBxccvldXPs" rel="nofollow"&gt;special glass&lt;/a&gt; features their golden harp, which you are supposed to aim for when pouring. This and the special curvatures of the glass help give the beer a good head and keep it until you're done with the beer. Stouts especially benefit from a silky, creamy head, so Guinness designed a glass around that.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've never had Kwak, but from the looks of the glass it seems to be more of a branding effort than anything else. I can't imagine any potential benefits from a glass that shape.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_glassware#Belgian_and_Dutch_styles" rel="nofollow"&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; article is a good read. It tells you what beer goes in what glass and why.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Actually, the glass does serve a purpose. &lt;a href="http://gloriousfoodandwinebelgianbeer.blogspot.com/2005/10/belgian-beer-no3-kwak-and-interesting.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;This site&lt;/a&gt; says the glass was invented for coachmen who weren't able to leave the horses and have some beer. The glass's peculiar shape allows it to be hung on the side of the coach for easy drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It depends on the beer style. Craft beers in general were not designed to be served at a near freezing (for water) temperature. Drink an IPA at 35 degrees and 45 degrees and you'll probably find the hop notes more pronounced at the higher temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is a general guideline:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Very Cold: 35-40 degrees
					•American Adjunct Lagers (“Macros”)
					•Malt Liquors
					•Light or low alcohol beers&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Cold: 40-45 degrees
					•Pilsner
					•Light-bodied lagers
					•Kolsch
					•Belgian Wit
					•Hefeweizen
					•Berliner weisse
					•American Wheat&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Cool: 45-50 degrees
					•American Pale Ales
					•Medium-bodied lagers
					•India Pale Ale (IPA)
					•Porters
					•Alt
					•Irish Stouts
					•Sweet Stout&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Cellar Temp: 50-55 degrees
					•Sour Ales
					•Lambic/Gueuze
					•English Bitter
					•Strong Ales
					•Baltic Porters
					•Bocks
					•Scotch Ales
					•Belgian Ales
					•Trappist Ales&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Warm: 55-60 degrees
					•Imperial Stouts
					•Belgian Quads
					•Belgian Strong Ales
					•Barley Wines
					•Old Ales
					•Dopplebock
					•Eisbock&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I grew up in Belgium, near the town of Leuven where Stella was originally brewed. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The classic Belgian beers all have their characteristic glass shapes, which are a part of the experience of the beer.  Duvel, Kwak, Mort Subite and the rest come in glasses of various shapes and sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The traditional Stella Artois glass was a straight, narrow-ish glass, much like that of other basic lager-style beers like Jupiler or Maes Pils.  They usually have a set of ridges towards the bottom for improved grip and to reduce heat transfer.  The lager brand glasses are all very similar, reflecting their status as "ordinary, everyday" beers.  Only the expensive specialty beers have really distinctive glasses.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The glasses are usually small for Belgian lager (about 275ml), so the beer would still taste cold and fresh at the bottom.  Larger half-litres are sold, but older Belgians would always drink a small beer as larger beers go "off".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In my view the Chalice is pure marketing bullshit.  Taking an ordinary beer and dressing it up as something more expensive and more special than it is.  It makes me as angry as the UK positioning of the brand as French, when it is brewed in the very Flemish town of Leuven.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Freezing pint glasses is like using subwoofers in your Mini. It's too much of a good thing that drowns out the subtlety that is supposed to sell the product over and over. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Just because some beers taste better cold, such as lagers compared to ales, doesn't mean they taste better when they are nearly frozen at +1C. Our perception of flavour diminishes as something is cooled, and so beer tastes less sweet and wines taste more acidic as they get colder.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Breweries know this and they spend significant dollars to invent a beverage that has the maximum taste profile for the least amount of ingredient spend. Bringing that product out of its intended temperature zone and into numbness makes a Coors or Bud have almost no character at all.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I can also imagine that bars are going to be reluctant to cool their pint glasses and spend a lot of money on electricity when it makes the beers taste little better than ordinary ice water. The end result is a disappointing "freezie"-like experience that reduces the likelihood of someone ordering multiples of those over the course of an evening out, which is the ultimate benchmark for most bars.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You are creating an atmosphere where the liquid inside the glass is warmer than the glass itself = condensation = watered down, affecting the beer no matter what style you drink (Certified Sommelier)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The etching provides a nucleation point. To quote a couple paces:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;A nucleation point on a beer glass refers to an etched mark or pattern on the bottom of the inside of a beer glass.  The etching is called a nucleation point (or a widget in the UK) and helps the release of carbonation and can create a steady stream of bubble emanating from the etched portion of the glass. This works by CO2 releasing (dissolving into gas) when it comes in contact with the rough surface of the nucleation points.  This is not a mere marketing ploy and a nucleation point does increase the amount of bubbles released when compared side by side with a &lt;a href="http://www.truebeer.com/Nucleation-Points_c_163.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;non- nucleated beer glass.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;A laser etched nucleation site within the glass maintains flavor release during the drinking experience. &lt;a href="https://www.samueladams.com/media/press-releases/2007/march/samuel-adams-unveils-the-samuel-adams-boston-lager-pint-glass" rel="nofollow"&gt;Samuel Adams Unveils the Samuel Adams Boston Lager Pint Glass&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Glass vs bottle or can will be a pretty noticeable difference with most styles of beer simply due to the size of the opening.  When you pour from the storage vessel to the glass you disturb the beer a lot which drives CO2 gas out, and that takes a lot of aromatics with it so the aroma you get from the beer in a glass is WAY stronger and more complex than what you'd sniff from the bottle or can.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also smell is a pretty huge part of tasting something and when you drink from a glass you're putting your nose right into the thick of all that, so the flavor will be more intense as well.  Bottles and cans sort of keep that toned down since you don't smell the beer as much.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There used to be a prejudice against cans because the liquid and the aluminum would react and oxidize, but they started coating the insides with a food safe epoxy resin decades ago and it's completely sealed now.  As far as taste goes there's no difference between the two, but cans actually store a bit better because they let in no light and no air while bottles will eventually let through enough to affect the beer.  Brewers like cans as well since they're more portable, don't shatter, chill faster, and are often cheaper to fill.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You need to pour carefully as normally you have quite thick tankage and/or parts of kvass (sometimes bread pieces and crumbs if it`s homemade one) can float in it. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My ancestors (and still my relatives) use limestone cellar to keep temperature-sensitive goods (including kvass) and the cellar`s floor is 3 meters below their ground level. At summer it's chilling cold down there and the Internet says the temperatures there fall into range of 5-10 degrees celsius (pretty much the temperature in a fridge). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Kvass is one of the best beverages for hot summer and if brewed good it`s as tasty as beer and contains almost no alcohol so you can continue doing any type of work you've been doing prior to drinking it (beer does not really have this wonderful feature). However the best one is hand-made at home as kvass sold in supermarkets is not good and sometimes it differs drastically (imagine a difference between a home-made lemonade from a restaurant and any bottle of one from a supermarket).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Actually you have nice words to ask in Spain for a shooter beer, but I can add somes:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;big quantity (1L or more)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mini
					cachi
					&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;regular size (200cl-500cl)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;tubo

					&lt;p&gt;little quantities:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cañita  
					corto
					chato  (used for beer but usually of wine)
					zurito (basque country and andalucia but extendind all over Spain)
					&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;but we have also words to name beer bottles depending the size:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;20cl bottle: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;botellin

					&lt;p&gt;I would add that beer that tends to last longer in a can because of way it's sealed.  No bottle cap for leaking oxygen and light can't penetrate so it's not going to be ruined as fast when it's sitting in the store fridge under the fluorescent lights&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think kvas tastes best when it is cold. In Moscow, say, when you are walking around in the summer, you see many stands with cooled containers where you can buy it. This type of kvas is not bad, but the best kvas is often made by some monastery &lt;a href="http://www.stsl.ru/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;like the one in Sergiev Posad&lt;/a&gt; - see the photo. The difference to standard types is huge.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There really isn't any reason why a modern pewter tankard would be harmful to drink from.  Lead has been illegal in pewter drinkware in the USA and western europe (at least) for decades now.  The FDA is widely considered VERY risk-averse and they are fine with pewter when it doesn't contain lead greater than a trace amount (see &lt;a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/GuidanceRegulation/UCM188545.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;FDA regulation 4-101.13(B)&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The other metals in pewter - mostly tin, with some copper and (usually) antimony - are very unlikely to cause a problem because they won't be absorbed into the beer in any material quantity, and because they are generally not harmful  if they were absorbed (see this page about &lt;a href="http://www.craftedcupcompany.com/about-pewter/" rel="nofollow"&gt;pewter tankards&lt;/a&gt;).  Remember tin's role as a coating for the inside of food containers?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;:  older pewter may well contain lead, and this is soluble in beer, and this is not safe.  The lead dissolving is what causes 'pitting' on the inside of older pewter tankards.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As to whether it's more enjoyable to drink out of glass or pewter, really comes down to personal taste.  I enjoy both.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Having the right shaped drinkware can improve the taste of beer.  For example, there's very specific reasons for the shape of a weizen vase, or a pilsner.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, more often than not unusual shaped glasses are about branding and nothing more.  In &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosteels_Brewery" rel="nofollow"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; wikipedia article it is claimed that the fancy Kwak beer glasses (which I like incidentally) were not launched until the 1980s.  IF that is true, their claim that it was designed for couchmen  unable to leave their horses rings a bit hollow...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I do think that although the flavor of your beer is paramount, there's a lot more to how you enjoy your beer than 'just' flavor.  Company, environment, and a beautiful glass or mug all contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most people would say yes, it does make a difference. Take a read of this article for some thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2014/07/11/can-this-glass-actually-make-beer-taste-better/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2014/07/11/can-this-glass-actually-make-beer-taste-better/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The type of glass can effect not only the aromas imparted to your nose but also how quickly the beer warms up and also the visual appeal too. I tell people you first taste things with your eyes, then your nose, then your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_glassware" rel="nofollow"&gt;Beer glasses&lt;/a&gt; are mainly a product of the region in which the beer was originated and therefore tied to a specific beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Belgian beers - Normally served in &lt;a href="http://www.ohio.com/polopoly_fs/1.457872!/image/image.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_500/hullabaloo.png" rel="nofollow"&gt;goblets&lt;/a&gt; because the beers have very complex aromas and the shape of the glass can help present and concentrate them for consumption.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;British beers - Normally served in the "&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=images&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwisj7zvsZTKAhUU5mMKHQIIAIgQjRwIAw&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAuthentic-British-Imperial-nonic-Etched%2Fdp%2FB007A0OZFE&amp;amp;psig=AFQjCNEv-ePikHEN5cnuMubUwDuS70vW7g&amp;amp;ust=1452142330583350" rel="nofollow"&gt;nonic&lt;/a&gt;" glass.  Simply a glass that is easier to hold in the hand whilst standing around the pub. Normally associated with most British ales.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Pilsner - High sided &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=images&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjb2qXFspTKAhUW7mMKHQyeCAsQjRwIAw&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FKitchen-Tall-Beer-Glasses-14-4oz-410ml%2Fdp%2FB00BMGWVBC&amp;amp;psig=AFQjCNEgUeJUiOw0x1O2jGuwy-cLwqvEUg&amp;amp;ust=1452142510579203" rel="nofollow"&gt;flute&lt;/a&gt; to concentrate the hop aroma and show off the high carbonation of Pilsners.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weissbeir - German wheat beers are usually served in &lt;a href="http://transatlanticbrews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Craft-beer-glasses-at-Joes-Wine-Cellar.jpg" rel="nofollow"&gt;tall glasses&lt;/a&gt; to show off the cloudy beer and also the creamy tall head of foam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scottish Ale - a &lt;a href="http://www.homebrewtalk.com/gallery/data/1/thistleor.jpg" rel="nofollow"&gt;Thistle glass&lt;/a&gt; designed to evoke the image of the national flower of Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stout - Popularized by Guinness, a &lt;a href="http://www.bettycrocker.com/~/media/Images/Flex-Article/January2013/Beer-for-Dessert/StoutBeer.jpg" rel="nofollow"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; designed to show off the nitrogen bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It might sound snobbish to be peckish about the type of glass but the glass does influence the taste of the beer. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some things are:
					 - the thickness of the glass. A thin glass invites to a more delicate way of drinking, a really thick glass would let you expect a sturdier beer.
					 - the surface compared to the volume of beer. A big surface gives a change to let of more aroma's but I would think you also need a little more foam.
					 - the capacity to keep the aroma's. As pointed out by Rube. Think of a cognac glass versus a &lt;a href="http://www.bierwoordenboek.com/getfile.aspx?file=Glazen%2FAmsterdammer.gif" rel="nofollow"&gt;vase&lt;/a&gt;. Some glasses also take in you nose deeper than others.
					 - the way the beer flows. The shape of the glass how quickly you can drink it without spilling. Think of &lt;a href="http://www.potjebier.nl/bier_glazen.asp?f=show&amp;amp;id=14" rel="nofollow"&gt;kwak&lt;/a&gt;, you HAVE to drink the last very carefully.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So to answer your question: there are many factors how the glass influences how you taste a beer. What's best is very subjective. You could at first stick to the opinion of the brewer, what he finds the best glass for it. If you like the taste with an other glass better, use that. I would not approach this as a hard science. Brewers might choose a specific glass to "stand out".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a Belgian I am always told by bartenders and brewers that for special (heavy) Belgian beers a Tulip glass is a good choice, except for Belgian Lambics (nl:Lambieken) for which one should use a flute glass. These glasses are sometimes  scratched at the bottom to better accommodate the bubbling (for example: Duvel Glasses)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown a correlation between a foods presentation and the perceived goodness of the taste.  So even excepting the usual reasons for matching a beer style to a glass style (head retention, aroma dispersal, etc.), presenting a beer in a good looking vessel will enhance its taste.&lt;/p&gt;

					  &lt;p&gt;While the names might differ, this is the key principle: there’s a
					  name for a large (425ml) and small (285ml) size in every state. Most
					  (but not all states) use schooner for the larger size, but the options
					  for the smaller one vary considerably:&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;there is no reason that I can find to why they have different measures but i have found a really good source of information to help understand what size beer to order &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Generally, washing and rinsing properly first time should mean this problem doesn't happen.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If it does, vinegar is an excellent residue remover. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Rinse the glass fully in clean water (no soap).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Rub the glass with a small sponge soaked in vinegar&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Rinse again&lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In short, it's because of taxation. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=wkUlAQAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA74633#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Commonwealth of Australia's Parliamentary Debates of 1904&lt;/a&gt; (p.8534),  The Honourable Chris Watson (who went on to become the 3rd Prime Minister) made a statement about the brewers of Sydney strongly objecting to a proposal for an excise duty on beer. The sentiment amongst Sydney's brewers was that the additional cost would be difficult to pass on to the consumer, and in fact they had thus far failed to do so. In response The Honourable Alexander Poynton, said that the tax had successfully been passed from brewers to consumers in South Australia by making the glasses smaller.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For the record, The Honourable Chris Watson expressed sadness at the notion of smaller glasses.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Pieces of lime are slightly denser than a mixture of water and alcohol, and so they will naturally sink at first. However, they also encourage carbon dioxide gas to come out of solution and form bubbles by making the liquid around the fruit more acidic (and thereby reduce the amount of dissolved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that it can hold). Unlike bubbles that form on the side of a glass and then detach, these bubbles will stick to the fruit and cause it to float to the surface. When sufficient bubbles have burst, the fruit sinks to the bottom again, and the cycle is repeated until no more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will come out of solution.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I believe the type of glass you are looking for is called an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Fashioned_glass" rel="noreferrer"&gt;"Old Fashioned glass"&lt;/a&gt; named for the cocktail typically served in it. Depending on the size of the drink you may possibly want request your drink in a "Double Old Fashioned glass". I would hope that simply requesting your martini be served in an Old Fashioned glass would suffice.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The widget is for aesthetic purposes only. it looks better with a head. But it flattens larger.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I refuse these glasses in pubs as I like a lively larger.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Test it your self. Test two largers in two glasses. One with a widget and one without. Taste the difference at the end of the pint.  The widget flattens the larger by removing CO2.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;See the Wikipedia article on it of course: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growler_(jug)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Growler (jug)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;A growler is a glass, ceramic, or stainless steel jug used to transport draft beer in the United States, Canada, Australia, Brazil and other countries....The significant growth of craft breweries and the growing popularity of home brewing has also led to an emerging market for the sale of collectible growlers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Plastic will melt really quickly. Glass might even shatter if it's not the proper type. You need something made out of Pyrex (or similar type glass). I couldn't find Pyrex shot glasses, but they do make &lt;a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B003TV9LQG" rel="noreferrer"&gt;100ml beakers&lt;/a&gt; that might serve your purpose!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is the usual great stuff relating to 'Toasting'. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toast_(honor)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;From wikipedia - which is normally correct.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I then had a quick look at snopes.com, they proclaim the following to be false:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Q: Why do people clink their glasses before drinking a toast?
					  A: It used to be common for someone to try to kill an enemy by offering him a poisoned drink. To prove to a guest that a drink was safe, it became customary for a guest to pour a small amount of his drink into the glass of the host. Both men would drink it simultaneously. When a guest trusted his host, he would then just touch or clink the host’s glass with his own.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;ORIGINS:   Many explanations have been advanced to explain our custom of clinking glasses when participating in toasts. One is that early Europeans felt the sound helped to drive off evil spirits. Another holds that by clanking the glasses into one another, wine could be sloshed from glass to glass, thereby serving as a&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wine glasses&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;proof the beverages had not been poisoned. Yet another claim asserts that the “clink” served as a
					symbolic acknowledgment of trust among imbibers who did not feel the need to sample each others’ drinks to prove them unadulterated.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Each of those explanations is false. While making a racket for the purpose of scaring off evil spirits underpins other customs that carry over to this day (e.g., the tolling of church bells at weddings, and the loud shouts and noisemaking at the stroke of twelve on New Year’s Eve), the “clink” is a relatively new aspect of toasting and, as such, came along well after folks had relinquished the notion that demons both lurked in every corner of typical day-to-day existence and could be sped on their way by a bit of noise. As for sloshing wine from one glass to another, drinking vessels would need to be filled to the brim to effect that, and if they were, such practice would waste valuable potables (because some would be sure to land on the floor) and likely douse the toasters too. And while the poisoning of enemies has long been part of the ordinary mayhem of the world, the practice of touching of one’s filled glass to those of others when participating in a toast is unrelated to suspicion of the wine’s having been tampered with; such killings were not so common at any nebulous point in the past that a signal to one’s host indicating he was clear of suspicion of attempted murder needed to be enshrined in the canon of social gestures.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To get at the real reason for the clink of glass on glass, we have to first look at why and how we toast, and where the practice originated.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The custom of sealing with booze expressions of good wishes for the health of others dates back so far that its origins are now lost to us, yet in numerous cultures&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;such acts of camaraderie often involved shared drinking vessels. The clinking of individual cups or glasses as a proof of trust wouldn’t have meant much when
					everyone drank from the same bowl. Indeed, in those cultures where shared drinking containers was the norm, to produce one’s own vessel in such company was to communicate an unmistakable message of hostility and distrust; it would have been regarded as akin to bringing along a food taster to sample the repast.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;“Toasting,” our term for the pronouncement of benedictions followed by a swallowing of alcohol, is believed to have taken its name from a practice involving a shared drinking vessel. Floated in the “loving cup” passed among celebrants in Britain was a piece of (spiced) cooked bread that the host would consume along with the last few drops of liquid after the cup had made one round of the company. In modern times toasting has become a matter of imbibing from individual drinking vessels rather than from one shared flagon, so to compensate for the sense of unity lost in doing away with the sharing of the same cup we have evolved the practice of simultaneously drinking each from our own glass when a toast is made, thereby maintaining a communal connection to the kind words being spoken.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The clinking of glasses has been added to the practice of offering toasts for a few reasons, none having anything to do with poison. Prior to such augmentation, toasts pleased only four of the five senses; by adding the “clink,” a pleasant sound was made part of the experience, and wine glasses have come to be prized not only for their appearance but also for the tones they produce when struck. Yet beyond mere aural pleasure, the act of touching your glass to that of others is a way of emphasizing that you are part of the good wishes being expressed, that you are making a physical connection to the toast. The practice also serves another purpose, that of uniting the individuals taking part in the benediction into a cohesive group: as the wine glasses are brought together, so symbolically are the people holding them. On a deeper level, the wine is also being recommuned with itself — that which had been one (when it had been in its own bottle) but was separated (when it was poured into a variety of glasses) is brought back into contact with the whole of itself, if only for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Etiquette mavens say one need not clink glasses with everyone present when participating in toasts among large assemblies. Rather than reach across vast expanses of wide tables (thereby risking losing your balance and ending up in the guacamole), simply raise your glass and make eye contact with the group.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;MY OWN THOUGHTS ON THE SUBJECT&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, with all this in mind, my own thought is that in times gone by as 'rivals' drank each others health, they would drink from the other person's cup (to avoid poisoning - however all one would have to do would be to poison one's own cup - surely that would have worked?!), as the cups were held to the other person's lips they would inadvertantly 'clink' together.  As time moved on and we attempted not to kill everyone in our paths the clinking just wort of became symbolic.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I spent many years in Germany  and other European countries drinking many different types of beer...I can tell you, for me, a Pilsner is best served in tall thin glasses, export beer in mugs, preferentially stein type and wheat beers in flute style glasses....taste, aroma and the expereince is all different with these glasses...oh and for general knowledge, fruits and other flavors only ruin beer....&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While "Wayne in Yak" pretty much covers ideal serving temperatures, I would like to add some sensory information.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When you drink or eat very cold foods &amp;amp; beverages, the low temperature inhibits the operation of your taste buds and other olfactory tasting parts of your body.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here's a quick experiment: taste a room-temperature soda/soft-drink Vs a refrigerated soft drink.  The warm version tastes much sweeter.  The sweetness of the beverage is calibrated for consumption at a low temperature.  It's too sweet drinking it warm.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sometimes on hot summer days, a cold &amp;amp; frosty beer is great.  I wont disagree there.  But the point is - if the beverage is &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; cold, you physically can't taste it very well.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is why many establishments do not freeze their glasses.  Just like steaks, soup and ice-cream, there's a specific temperature range at which the producer thinks the product is best.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In places where the ambient temperature is over 30C / 86F, then it makes sense to cool the glasses.  But here the idea here is that when the beverage at temperature-X is combined with a heavy glass at temperature-Y, the final resultant temperature should be in that ideal serving range.&lt;/p&gt;
