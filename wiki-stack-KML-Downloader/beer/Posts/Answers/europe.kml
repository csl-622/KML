					&lt;p&gt;The question is very broad - A lot of the answer would depend on a more specific geographical location and/or a narrower time-window.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For example in France, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavern" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Taverns&lt;/a&gt; and inns (not restaurants) were the only places for common people to eat-out all of the way up until the late 18th century, according to the wiki. This would seem to make them THE hot-spot in that region throughout that time...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's certainly popular in medieval arts to make an omage to taverns and inns in creative works:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;1.) &lt;a href="http://www.larsdatter.com/taverns.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Paintings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;2.) Many poems of the time: &lt;a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Archpoet" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Archpoet&lt;/a&gt; wishes to die in a tavern in his "Confession". See also: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trouble_at_a_Tavern" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Trafferth mewn Tafarn&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://archive.org/stream/dafyddapgwilympo00dafyuoft/dafyddapgwilympo00dafyuoft_djvu.txt" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Dafydd ap Gwilym&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;3.) There are likely more &lt;a href="http://www.medievalists.net/2014/11/medieval-drinking-song/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;drinking songs&lt;/a&gt; from the Middle Ages than one could ever hope to discover and research in a lifetime...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Given the popularity of alcohol in general, all of this would suggest that drinking establishments have been happening places before, during, and after the Middle Ages... Prob in Europe, and everywhere else... ;P&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I don't know for certain but movies set in that time period and region seem to indicate mead was fairly popular and its ABV could be more than 20% according to wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Stronger beverages like Absinthe, Gin and Vodka do not seem to have been invented by then.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="http://www.alexreisner.com/misc/distilled-spirits" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;History and Taxonomy of Distilled Spirits&lt;/a&gt; There is ample evidence that distilled spirits were available during the time period you mentioned in a variety of places. We know that that Greek Alchemists developed the distillation processes about 1 AD and that a true distillation process was developed in Italy in the 1200s at the School of Salerno and Fractional Distillation was developed in the 1300s in Italy again. (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distilled_beverage" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Distilled Beverages Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;) In 1313 there is evidence that &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/origin-of-brandy/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Brandy&lt;/a&gt; had been made, although not widespread. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Then it seems in the 1400s, the doors open wide across Europe for distilled spirits.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Claims upon the origin of specific beverages are controversial, often
					  invoking national pride, but they are plausible after the 12th century
					  AD, when Irish whiskey and German brandy became available. These
					  spirits would have had a much lower alcohol content (about 40% ABV)
					  than the alchemists' pure distillations, and they were likely first
					  thought of as medicinal elixirs. Consumption of distilled beverages
					  rose dramatically in Europe in and after the mid-14th century, when
					  distilled liquors were commonly used as remedies for the Black Death.
					  Around 1400, methods to distill spirits from wheat, barley, and rye
					  beers, a cheaper option than grapes, were discovered. Thus began the
					  "national" drinks of Europe: jenever (Belgium and the Netherlands),
					  gin (England), Schnaps (Germany), grappa (Italy), borovička
					  (Slovakia), horilka (Ukraine), akvavit/snaps (Scandinavia), vodka
					  (Poland and Russia), ouzo (Greece), rakia (the Balkans), and poitín
					  (Ireland). The actual names emerged only in the 16th century, but the
					  drinks were well known prior to then. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, from about 500AD to 1300 AD, it was possible you could find distilled spirits, they were not widely available. Then in the 1300s distilled spirits spread across Europe and became widely available by the 1500s. Which one was actually the strongest? We'll never know but 90+% ABV was probably achievable with 1500s technology. &lt;/p&gt;
