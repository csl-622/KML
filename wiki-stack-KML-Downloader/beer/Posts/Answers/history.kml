					&lt;p&gt;There are a few theories out there, and their veracity, like that of most historical "facts", is hotly debated.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One theory begins in 1722 when Ralph Harwood, a London brewer, created a beer called &lt;em&gt;Entire&lt;/em&gt;.  For some time, working folk had been drinking a blend of beer, ale, and strong beer, which pubs would mix to balance out their stocks and maintain acceptable flavor.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entire&lt;/em&gt; was a pre-mixed version, brewed by Hardwood then sold and delivered to pubs.  Prior to this point, each pub had mixed their own.  In addition to economies of scale, Harwood's method allowed for aging of the finished product.  Historians theorize that the name &lt;em&gt;porter&lt;/em&gt; came about because of the porters who worked at the markets and delivered the final product to the pubs.  A variation of this theory suggests that &lt;em&gt;porter&lt;/em&gt; simply refers to the working class occupations of those who drank the concoction.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another theory suggests that &lt;em&gt;porter&lt;/em&gt; comes from the Netherlands, where a beer called &lt;em&gt;poorter&lt;/em&gt; was being made as early as the 1300s.  The Dutch were prolific traders, and cultural transfer could easily have occurred.  The term &lt;em&gt;poorter&lt;/em&gt; originally concerned inhabitants of walled cities and may also have been related to social station.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure about when the first beer was &lt;em&gt;made&lt;/em&gt;, but the oldest existing brewery is &lt;a href="http://www.totalbeveragesolution.com/weihenstephan/"&gt;Weihenstephan&lt;/a&gt;, which dates back to 1040 AD, a good 26 years before the battle of Hastings. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.livescience.com/32424-when-was-beer-invented.html"&gt;LiveScience&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;beer dates back to the dawn of cereal agriculture, loosely pinpointed
					  at 10,000 B.C.E. in ancient Mesopotamia, the region of southwest Asia
					  currently occupied by Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I also recall watching a documentary a few years back (unfortunately can't remember the name to properly cite it) which claimed that humans started settling and agriculture because they accidentally consumed some sort of primitive beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I don't think there's really a good answer to this question. Beer is an ancient beverage, whose formulations and methods of manufacture have changed over the centuries. The oldest continually operating brewery is claimed to be the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weihenstephan_Abbey" rel="nofollow"&gt;Weihenstephan Abbey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;More than a millenia ago, there were few standardized recipies for herbs to add during the beer brewing process.  "Gruit" referred to the herbal mixtures used to flavor and preserve beer.  Gruit was usually sold under papal license exclusive to certain areas at various monasteries and therefore represented a monopoly in Christian areas of the Catholic Church.  Traditionally it included plants such as yarrow, mugwort, henbane, sweet gale, bog rosemary, juniper, and more.  Some of these survive in gin recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Why gruit has largely been replaced by hops is a fascinating and divisive historical question.  There may however have been a number of factors including the possibility (largely untested) that hops beers kept longer and the rising concern by Protestant (and even Catholic) nobles of the power of the economic power that this gave Catholic institutions.  What is known is that a campaign was waged against gruit and the purported (and likely actual) mind altering properties of it.  The use of gruit was more or less entirely supplanted by hops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;More recently some breweries have been experimenting with gruit beers for national pride and/or historical reasons.  These include Fraoch and Alba from the Williams Brothers in Scotland, and a few other examples. They are not common however and are certainly specialty beers today.  Additionally the gruits used in commercial beers are pretty tame by historical standards.  I haven't found any including herbs like henbane (which was one of the historical staples of brewing, used even more prevalently than hops is today).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As Slyboty notes correctly, beer is a very ancient drink predating the oldest written records (and likely any archeological discoveries.) For millennia though beer was made only from fermented malt with various add-ons.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The major change that gave origin to modern beers though is the &lt;strong&gt;addition of hops&lt;/strong&gt;, for the first time creating a beer closely resembling modern lagers. The first documented use of hops in beer is dated 822 A.D.&lt;a href="http://www.aperfectpint.net/Hops.pdf"&gt; [source]&lt;/a&gt; although records of hops cultivation dates back to 736 &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hops#cite_note-6"&gt;[source]&lt;/a&gt; which suggests use of hops in brewing predates written records by a considerable margin.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The simple answer is "nobody knows."  I must apologize for being a bit of a history nut here and this may tell you far more than you ever wanted to know...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Fermentation of grain is universal, as is fermentation of fruit and honey. You find it in the new world with drinks like chicha (an Andean drink where saliva provides the amylase to break down corn starch into sugars for fermentation), among Native Americans in North America as well, in early Europe, in early China, and early Japan as well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Grain fermenting is a remarkably complex process because yeast can't digest starch so you have to have some way of turning starches into sugars.  These break down into more or less three strategies:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;malting (roasting sprouted grains).  Interestingly doesn't work for rice.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;helper cultures, like they use to make sake.  Add a fungus that breaks down starch and then a yeast to eat the sugar.  Indonesian "Tape" (rice or cassava "beer" or paste) is done this way as is Chinese rice beer and wine.  As a bonus this also works on other starches, like yams (used in Malaysia).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Chewing the grains to mix with saliva and then spitting in a bowl as with the Andean Chicha drink.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;South America has all three methods represented, as does early Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The fact that different strategies are employed around the world suggests to my mind that brewing did not start somewhere and spread but was independently reinvented in different places.  It is probably for this reason extremely old, far older than we have direct evidence for.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for beer, the question becomes what you mean.  If you mean fermented grains, we have no idea.  It's very very old and might go back to neolithic times if not even earlier (though I suspect that the organized grain agriculture of neolithic times was an absolute prerequisite to grain fermentation).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you mean malt, yeast, and hops, we still don't know.  We have evidence that hops was cultivated for beer in Augustine's time, and Old Norse distinguishes between beer and ale by the use of hops but Old English "beor" means something different (probably very strong mead with herbs?), suggesting perhaps that the hops distinction post-dated the split of Old Norse (and thus 8th century), but that doesn't get you very far.  What is pretty clear is that it certainly predates our earliest records of the practice.  By how much and when did it become a separate drink?  I don't think we will ever know.  At any rate the early prevalence of hops as one herb used in brewing among many in early England and Scandinavia suggests (though does not prove) that hops were adopted (again as one herb among any) for beer brewing by the Germanic tribes, some time before we have written records.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Now as for lager, these are far more recent.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finally as a note, until maybe a hundred years ago, before modern capping and beer cans, most beer would have been sold uncarbonated, but speciality beers were carbonated much like champagne is today.  My own home brewing experiments (I even brew as a history nut) with non-carbonated beers suggest that they are of an altogether different character than carbonated ones (owing to the carbonic acid in carbonated drinks).  The flavors are lighter, sweeter, brighter, and more distinct, and entirely different than "flat" beer.  This is because dissolved carbon dioxide imparts extra acidity to beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;:  It also occurs to me that controlled fermentation is one of the most common ways of preserving foods in the pre-industrial ages.  This includes lactic fermentation (that gives us shelf-stable cheese, salami, sauerkraut, etc), but also alcoholic fermentation must be included there too.  There's no reason to think that the first fermented grains were fermented by accident.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, there are currently beers that are served warm, particularly very dark ones.  So part of it has to do with the character of beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are two important factors I see, looking at this as a history nut but not knowing of any sources on this topic.  The first, as you say, is widespread refrigeration.  But this was not the major factor in cold beverages generally since ice was often preserved into the summer for cooling beverages (and has been since ancient times).  But refrigeration makes this easier and thus cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The second is actually the modern bottlecap which is a product of industrialization.  Before the bottlecap most beers were served uncarbonated.  They might be chilled or not, but they would have been entirely uncarbonated, shipped in wooden barrels, etc. and had an altogether different flavor and character than our modern beers.  My experience playing with these concepts as a homebrewer suggests that such beers were better suited to being served warm than comparably dark carbonated beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To understand why, I think you have to look at carbonation and how temperature affects that.  Carbon dioxide is more soluble in cold water than warm water, so the warmer the beer is, the faster it goes flat, and the more it fizzes when opened.  So you have two ways carbonation affects the picture.  First it impacts the taste and serving conditions differently at different temperatures, and secondly it imparts a distinctive off-tang when the beer goes flat.  Temperature helps offset the latter to a mild extent but at the expense of the former.  I think this also helps explain why richer beers are more often served warm than lighter beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hops#Other_uses"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, hops can be used in other beverages.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The only major commercial use for hops is in beer, although hops are also an ingredient in Julmust, a carbonated beverage similar to soda that is popular in Sweden during December, as well as Malta, a Latin American soft drink. Hops are sometimes added to some varieties of kvass. They are also used for flavor in some tisanes.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hops are also used medicinally. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Hops are also used in herbal medicine in a way similar to valerian, as a treatment for anxiety, restlessness, and insomnia.  &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Hops are of interest for hormone replacement therapy, and are used in preparations for relief of menstruation-related problems.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In answer to part of your question, there are probably no other reasons for large-scale cultivation of hops in the 8th century other than for brewing.  While hops were used in medicine, the major national herbals of Anglo-Saxon England don't mention them.  That we have strong references in early 8th century England (see "Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink" by Ann Hagen) to comparatively large-scale cultivation of hops strongly suggests they were used in brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hops are used in medicine as well, but the amounts used there are very small in comparison to those used for brewing, and the two major Anglo-Saxon national herbals, Bald's Leechbook and The Lacnunga don't mention them (I think the Old English Herbarium does, but it is a translation into Old English of a continental Latin work).  Keep in mind most of my work with these has been in translation (Pollington's) and translating plants from the descriptions often poses interesting issues.  I could probably find standarized editions in Old English if needed however.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting connections here is that two of the most important early brewing herbs, hops and henbane, both had strong connections to female medical concerns (this is also interesting because historically brewing was women's work, hence the obsolete term "alewife" not referring to a fish--- the woman's place in keeping a tavern was privileged but brewing was sort of like cooking, something every woman was supposed to know).  Hops to heavy periods, and henbane was used to address pain in childbirth.  Both of these may contribute to Bald's warning that pregnant women may drink ale safely but not beer, for beer would cause a risk of miscarriage.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In general for hops to be grown to an extent noteworthy, one is almost certainly talking about brewing, whether grains or honey, and whether alone or with other herbs.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer was commonly drunk in the middle ages (and renaissance), but what they drank is different from the beer we're used to today.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer and ale, being grain-based, were important dietary staples -- it's said that beer is liquid bread, and that's not far off.  For the common man (not nobility), in particular, grain made up a substantial part of the diet, with meat being fairly rare.  (Will try to update later with a friend's research on amount of grain/household consumed in medieval England, but it's substantial.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Common beer was not aged for months or years like some beers today; rather, a batch might be produced in as little as half a week.  These are "small beers" (or "small ales", for the unhopped variety), which are mildly alcoholic but drinkable in volume without unfortunate effects.  These small beers/ales were produced in the home/manor; it was just one more task for the cooks.  (See, for example, Markham's &lt;em&gt;The English Housewife&lt;/em&gt;, 1615 -- so that's rnnaissance not medieval, but is consistent with earlier cooking sources I've seen.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm not aware of exceptions being made for pregnant women and small children.  Arguing from absence of evidence is risky, but I've worked with a variety of medieval and renaissance cookbooks and the occasional medicinal source, and I haven't seen anything along the lines of "drinks for the pregnant and young".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I do not know much  but I know there is a published book about that. &lt;strong&gt;Beer in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Richard W. Unger&lt;/em&gt;. Some lines from the excerpt of the book:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Modern beer, however, has little in common with the drink that carried that name through the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Looking at a time when beer was often a nutritional necessity, was sometimes used as medicine, could be flavored with everything from the bark of fir trees to thyme and fresh eggs, &lt;strong&gt;and was consumed by men, women, and children alike&lt;/strong&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was the beverage of choice of urban populations that lacked access to secure sources of potable water&lt;/strong&gt;; a commodity of economic as well as social importance; &lt;strong&gt;a safe drink for daily consumption that was less expensive than wine&lt;/strong&gt;; and a major source of tax revenue for the state. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Unger describes the transformation of the industry &lt;strong&gt;from small-scale production that was a basic part of housewifery&lt;/strong&gt; to a highly regulated commercial enterprise dominated by the wealthy and overseen by government authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These are some part I crop from the excerpt. Probably book have more but since I do not own it, I can not help you more.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;update: There is a big excerpt in &lt;a href="http://books.google.com.tr/books?id=7eYLjJp0y7UC"&gt;Google Books&lt;/a&gt;. It contains first a few tens of pages with some removed pages but I guess it will give you more ingormation about that.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There appears to be no consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;After scanning hundreds of Google results for &lt;code&gt;polewka piwna&lt;/code&gt; (and &lt;code&gt;polewka beer&lt;/code&gt;) using Google Translate to read pages in Polish, I found, as you did, most recipes refer generically to "beer (not dark)."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I found several pages getting as specific as "Lager."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I found a single blog post whose author used a blueberry-flavored ale.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Therefore I'd conclude it's a matter of taste—maybe not a matter at all, but if so, up to experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Let me start off by saying that I am an Italian-American, not a drop of Polish blood in me; so I'm not really in sync with Polish traditions.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With that said, most of the recipes I'm seeing make it clear that you want to use a light beer, so obviously you're not gonna want to use a stout or porter here (though I'd be curious how it tastes; my friend swears by Guinness in his beef stew). With that said, most lagers or pilsners (a type of lager) should be fine for your purposes (of course I would avoid macro-lagers like Bud, Coors, and Miller because they are awful). &lt;a href="http://www.anchorbrewing.com/beer/anchor_steam" rel="nofollow"&gt;Anchor Steam Beer&lt;/a&gt; might be interesting in the soup as it packs a lot of flavor for a lager type beer in my opinion. For authenticity, you're likely gonna want to use a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilsner" rel="nofollow"&gt;pilsner&lt;/a&gt;. You have to realize, as the Wikipedia article points out, that until the 1840's or so, most beer from the area was top-fermented (like ales; modern pilsners and lagers are bottom-fermented) and the taste varied widely, so I'm not sure how a beer 300-500 years ago would have tasted. The closest you'll likely be able to go back is the 1840's; in which case I'd give Pilsner Urquell a shot as it's the first pilsner beer in the world. Victory makes a mean pilsner (&lt;a href="http://www.victorybeer.com/beers/braumeister-pils/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Braumeister Pils&lt;/a&gt;) too. Unfortunately it's draft only, so if you have a growler handy you can use it; otherwise best look elsewhere. Of course you can probably get away with most &lt;a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/style/40/?start=50" rel="nofollow"&gt;Czech pilsners&lt;/a&gt;. I can't figure out why Beer Advocate doesn't have a sorting option so that you can sort based upon the rating, but I digress. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You have to remember that beer was much different 300-500 years ago. Yes, there are some breweries such as  Dogfish Head who recreate ancient ales. Yards has also recreated three brews based upon George Washington's, Thomas Jefferson's, and Ben Franklin's (my favorite of the three) original recipes. But for the most part, beer has evolved in the last 300-500 years; even in the case of the Dogfish Head and Yards brews I mentioned since they have to be pasteurized and must meet the (stupid) FDA standards here in the US. If you've ever tried raw milk, you know how much pasteurization changes the flavor; same goes for juice and beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With that said, lets go back to the whole top-fermenting thing. You might want to give a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%A4tzer" rel="nofollow"&gt;grätzer&lt;/a&gt; a try as well. It's an ancient Polish beer which has been recently making a comeback. There's a &lt;a href="http://sfbrewersguild.org/blog/historic-gratzer-beer-recreated-by-team-of-san-francisco-brewers" rel="nofollow"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; going on right now to recreate the brew. However, since the brew is so (recently) new, I'm not sure how available it is; you'll likely have to make a trip to San Francisco to get some. There are others too, such as those offered by &lt;a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/24134/81644/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Westbrook Brewing Co.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/piwo-grodziskie--gratzer-ale/157564/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Schlossbrauerei Au&lt;/a&gt;. But I'm not sure how readily available these are either. You're probably better off brewing this once yourself until this beer is pulled off the "endangered beers" list. &lt;a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/08/beer-styles-grodziski-gratzer-polish-smoked-wheat-beer-history.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Yards has also experimented&lt;/a&gt; with this style, but again, it's not readily available (see &lt;a href="http://www.yardsbrewing.com/retired." rel="nofollow"&gt;Tadeusz Kosciuszko Smoked Pol&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.europeanbeerguide.net/polbrew.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;This website&lt;/a&gt; may also be of use to you; it outlines a history of Polish beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The answer is complex, to be honest.  In the Middle Ages?  Where?  When?  These are important questions.  Lumping around a thousand years and very different cultural eras (ranging from the Vendell-era Norse to the Byzantine Empire) into the same label is problematic at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The answer I think to the question as stated has to be "no" insofar as there were times and places in the Middle Ages where beer was a clear luxury (early medieval Iceland comes to mind).  Similarly, it isn't always clear that beer was universally consumed by the lower classes in much of the Middle Ages (though certainly towards the end it became more common).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 1:  Anglo-Saxon England&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This being said, beer was an important dietary staple in much (though not all!) of medieval Europe at least among monks, merchants, and the upper classes.  Heavier beers were used as bread substitutes.  For the common man in Anglo-Saxon England, though, even bread was a luxury  and most grains were cooked into gruel, porridge, either with or without fracturing (think of bulgur wheat).  This would then be supplemented with vegetables, eggs, dairy, and sometimes meat (even for the serfs, at least in Anglo-Saxon England, meat was not out of the question).  Well water was the primary source of hydration in this era (again see Hagen, below), and laws were passed to ensure that drinking water directly from someone else's well was protected, legal activity (in other words, a well owner could restrict what people could take away from the well, but not what they could drink on the spot).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If we separate out the lower classes and the areas where beer was not commonly available (Iceland, for example) the picture changes dramatically.  Beer was very common, but not at all a homogeneous beverage.  Bald's Leechbook (10th Century, Anglo-Saxon) contains the warning that while "&lt;em&gt;ealu&lt;/em&gt;" (-&gt; ale) may be consumed by pregnant women, "&lt;em&gt;beor&lt;/em&gt;" (-&gt; beer) causes miscarriage.  Identifying these beverages is problematic. Ann Hagen ("Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink") suggests that "beor" must have been a strong mead instead of a malt liquor based on descriptions of specific gravity (she calculates a minimum alcohol content of around 20%).  If it was a strong mead, it may have been further supplemented by herbs like mugwort, henbane, and hops, and therefore even more problematic than a strong mead might be.  In this case, it would have been fermented grains would have been certainly consumed by children and pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Interestingly the traditional fermented rice and cassava dishes here in Indonesia are acceptable to serve to children too.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources on history&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Hagen, Ann.  "&lt;em&gt;Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Pollington, Stephen.  "&lt;em&gt;Leechcraft&lt;/em&gt;" (for an edition of Bald's Leechbook with facing page translation).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 2:  Medieval Iceland&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The early Icelandic settlers tried to grow barley for beer with only very limited success.  Alcoholic beverages were thus very much a luxury item, and usually if someone was going to have it (going mostly by medieval saga evidence as ethnography), it was going to be someone who had gone viking and returned with a fair bit of wealth.  A second point though is that Icelandic society recognized about three levels of society (&lt;em&gt;godhi&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;bondi&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;thrall&lt;/em&gt;) based on relationship to certain kinds of property:  a &lt;em&gt;godhi&lt;/em&gt; (priest-attorney-legislator-jurist) owned a &lt;em&gt;godhord&lt;/em&gt; (the office was property and could be sold, loaned, or even put into partnership property).  A &lt;em&gt;bondi&lt;/em&gt; (free juryman) owned land.  And a &lt;em&gt;thrall&lt;/em&gt; was owned (though the actual requirements would have been more like early serfdom than slavery due to a lack of central administration and enforcement).  In addition to successful bondi-turned-vikings, you would have had the fact that a godhi had sufficient economic benefits from office to likely be able to afford alcoholic beverages at least sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In Iceland, drinking was usually a social action and as far as the existing evidence goes would have been a specifically male activity limited to the sorts of ritualized drinking portrayed in Beowulf (such ritualized drinking is portrayed in the Volsung Saga, Egill's Saga, Njall's Saga, and many many others).  Drunkenness was warned against in the literature, and there are very interesting questions of what else was put in the beverages, since poisoning was a pretty clear concern in the literature (Eddic poems such as Havamal and Sigdrifumal speak to both these concerns).  From archaeological evidence from "continental" Scandinavia, we may surmise henbane was common, and this may to some extent play into the references to military drinking in Hrolf Kraki's Saga.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In short, in Iceland, as far as we can tell, beer and mead would have been limited to far more ritualized roles (reinforcing social obligations, certain forms of oaths, etc).  Literature on women and alcohol is very sparse.  It's probable that the bride drank at the wedding as part of making the wedding official.  There's a lot of uncertainty beyond this however in terms of attitudes towards pregnancy and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Further reading:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;the various sagas referenced above.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Poetic Edda&lt;/em&gt; (I usually recommend the Hollander translation if you are going to work in translation because he tends to be transparent about which emendations he is using).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Byock, Jesse:  &lt;em&gt;Viking-Age Iceland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Byock, Jesse:  &lt;em&gt;Medieval Iceland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Roesdahl, Else: &lt;em&gt;The Vikings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Pollington, Stephen: &lt;em&gt;Leechcraft&lt;/em&gt; (for some archaeological discussions of Scandinavian forts and brewing).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is no production of alcohol without yeast. Bevore the "discovery" (better: selection and cultivation) of the Yeasts we know and use today, humans had to rely on luck.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Its a wild fermentation, many different microbes and fungi are competing for their nutrition (sugar). 
					The problem here is: Many yeasts produces fusel alcohol, i.e. methyl alcohol (which can cause blindness).
					Other bacteria could cause the fermentation to vinegar.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So the resulting product seldom was good, mostly it was not drinkable for us today ;)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Since the cultivation of special yeasts it's possible to control the fermentation, while adding a big amount of the yeast. So this yeast has a big advantage over others. Further the produced alcohol and carbondioxyde protects the beverage from other organisms.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are many plants where yeast grows in symbiotic mutuality. Take fresh dark grapes - the slight white "sediment" on the surface is natural yeast, and you won't find grapes without it. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another such plant is barley. Normally, the yeast only appears on the seeds, in relatively small amounts. Malting creates optimal environment for the yeast growth though, making the whole volume of the seed (as opposed to just the surface) nutritious for the yeast, and as it grows, it produces alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sure there is always a risk that a different culture of fungi or bacteria takes over, killing off the yeast (and e.g. producing vinegar instead of alcohol) but if brewing is performed in relative cleanliness, with little contaminants that could disrupt the process, the natural yeast will take over and dominate it, killing off all competing cultures.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Currently, cultured yeast provide a kick-start to the process, simply leaving no time for different cultures to dominate the batch, and radically shortening the process that would normally take a long time until natural yeast reaches concentrations you create by just adding cultured yeast, but it's not essential to the process - it's just a strong push in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Before brewers discovered the importance of yeast in the brewing process they had to rely on the local wild yeasts for fermentation.  Louis Pasteur discovered the importance of yeast to brewing in 1857.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ancient brewers still used the same process of mashing the grains to extract sugars for fermentation and adding hops for bittering and preservation.  As a side note, prior to the use of hops in brewing brewers used a mix of herbs called "gruit" which provided flavoring but no preservation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Certain areas of the world are known to have wild yeasts better suited to brewing and still produce beers of this style today, such as Belgian lambics.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You don't need to know what something is to use it effectively.  Though yeast was only identified as a microorganism recently, it has been known as the cause of fermentation for many centuries.  It's easy to underestimate how sophisticated people throughout history were.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Before yeast was monocultured in labs it was actively cultured by brewers.  They would transfer the yeast cake from a batch that's finishing into a recently-brewed batch.  This cake contained a whole ecosystem of yeasts and bacterias, but a few strains were usually dominant.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;By applying artificial selection brewers developed different strains of yeast in different areas.  The yeast culture was &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; make-or-break characteristic of a brewery, and defined the styles of beer that could be produced more than any other factor (other than water in Burton).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Evidence of this process comes from the history of lager: bottom-fermenting yeast (Saccharomyces carlsbergensis) emerged in the fifteenth century as a direct result of the cold storage regime of northern brewers such as Carlsberg.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They may not have known it was a microorganism, but middle ages brewers most certainly knew that yeast was the cause of fermentation.  That's why they called it "Godisgood".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Vikings used to brew beer (some of us still do!). They did this without the specific knowledge of yeast. Each family owned a stock of wood that belonged to the family brewery which was used to stir the wort prior to fermentation. This inoculated the wort and provided the yeast needed for fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Although they didn't know why it happened, they did know that unless they used the stirring stock, they wouldn't get beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Part of the answer has to do with how the beverages survived prohibition.  Winemakers were allowed to continue producing various grape products like grape juice, and even sold home wine kits with explicit instructions on how to avoid making wine from them.  Very tongue-in-cheek.  A lot of liquor distillers managed to survive somewhat on their liquors being considered "medicinal".  Beer, however, basically got demolished.  Especially considering their suffering during World War 1, which had just ended when prohibition began.  Any businesses that survived prohibition that used to be breweries either became producers of other products like ice cream or made barely alcoholic barley-based beverages.  Brewing in the US was at a huge disadvantage coming out of prohibition, and the few surviving large companies managed to successfully lobby to have the new distribution laws written to benefit them.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, as I mentioned wine and liquor sort of continued to be produced during Prohibition.  This led to their presence in the speakeasies, and their inclusion in the invention of many new cocktails.  People being used to them over the past few years, and the allure of being what was drank in speakeasies, acted as built in marketing.  Which beer lacked.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finally, beer was much less transportable than wine or liquor, especially liquor.  While localized wineries managed to survive, most people's local brewery had folded.  Liquor and wine became go-to drinks, and the only beer being promoted was from a few larger companies that needed to ramp up to reach everyone.  They were basically able to write their own ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;We're sort of in the opposite place now where consumer demand is for beer instead of liquor and wine, and the demand is for beer that's coming from smaller and more regional breweries, which I imagine is how wine was back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am not an historian, some of this is inference from known fact rather than referenced fact, but I think it makes sense and hopefully it helps you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h1&gt;Part of it is philosophical&lt;/h1&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Why are airplane pilots regulated differently from car drivers?  Because it's much easier to do damage with one vs the other.  Likewise, it's a lot easier to get so drunk that you do something stupid (or just get alcohol poisoning) on liquor than beer.  As such, they're treated differently.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h1&gt;Part of it is political&lt;/h1&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The companies that make beer are not generally the same ones that make liquor.  Those two groups of companies also have different groups of lobbyists, who have pushed for laws at different times in different political climates.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h1&gt;Part of it is practical&lt;/h1&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Liquor and beer production face different logistical needs.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Beer has much higher shipping costs per dollar worth of product, so shipping rules might need to be different.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Breweries have a need to keep their product cold at the point of sale, so it might make sense to have them sold in stores that already have coolers (like gas stations), whereas liquor companies wouldn't push as hard for that availability.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Liquor has no equivalent of the brewpub, so they don't really care much about sales at their production facility.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Beer has less consumer utility per unit of volume than liquor (ie, you need more of it to have the same amount of fun), so people generally need it closer to their houses.  Since you don't need to buy liquor as often as you buy beer, it's more feasible to have centralized liquor stores&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;h1&gt;Part of it is "moral"&lt;/h1&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Especially on the US East coast, there are a lot of laws around booze with their origins in religious morality and the puritan aversion to alcohol.  Beer, being seen as a "lesser evil", tends to have less opposition to laws that would increase its availability.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think it has something to do with the thinking of Whiskey Rebellion, -- a tax was on spirts but not wine or beer.  Whiskey was considered a luxury tax - yet it turns out a LOT of people were making and drinking Whiskey at the time&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In addition to the ground covered in other answers, some of it undoubtedly is historical in nature due to the fact that wine, beer, and other ales historically were consumed for hydration and energy.  &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/quora/2013/05/21/medieval_europe_why_was_water_the_most_popular_drink.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;This slate article&lt;/a&gt; covers some of this; while it was probably a myth that people drank ales as a source of clean water, they did hydrate and gain energy from them.  As such, beer and ale were associated with 'normal' consumption, much like soda would be today, and thus is treated somewhat differently from 'spirits', which have no real purpose other than getting one drunk, and even from wine, which was primarily associated with the nobility.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Guinness licenses their brand and recipe to many breweries which is why they are so prolific everywhere. An example is the fact that Labatt's brews most Guinness sold in North America. So, their widespread popularity is simply a combination of marketing and smart distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's complicated.  I think you have to look at these laws as an intersection of the practical and the cultural.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Let's look at two different distinctions you make.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home Production&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the US, you can usually make your own beer, mead, or wine, but cannot make hard liquor without a license from BATF, state licenses, tax payments, etc.  Exact laws of course vary state by state, but the US tax code contains exemptions for home brewers and wine makers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason here is historical.  Liquor is a major tax source, and black market liquor hasn't always been very safe.  We hear stories about wood alcohol making people go blind, but the real problems were either accidental heavy metal poisoning or deliberate adulteration with relatively nasty chemicals.  In practice methyl alcohol was not a major problem, particularly accidental inclusion of it, as in most concentrations primarily makes the hangover significantly worse (btw, red wine is known for harsh hangovers as are some fruit brandies because of methyl alcohol content).  The adulterants have included (and do include in some parts of the world) things like battery acid, caustic soda, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A second problem of course is safety.  In the distilling process, you are dealing the combination, usually, of heating elements or open flames and a liquid that is roughly as flammable as gasolene.  While it is quite possible to distil safely, there are generally acknowledged gains health and safety-wise to pushing for a formal economy here.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wine Tastings vs Beer Tastings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here laws vary considerably between states.  For example, the one part of the liquor code that is explicitly applied to home brewers is an exemption for home brewing competitions.  So you can take your beer to a competition without losing the home brewing exemption.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wine tastings have almost always had some acceptance on the theory that making fine wine has a level of cultural refinement and aesthetic nuance that beer does not (we may find this false but it an attitude --- if you don't believe me, compare reading a wine review with a beer review).  The wine culture is different from the beer culture and so they make a different case.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Again laws here vary state by state.  However, the argument, I think, is that wine tasting is essential to the sales process, while beer drinkers are less picky on average.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In essence these laws have a practical component particularly where hard liquor is concerned, and a cultural component.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Reliability is a good factor.  Guinness is nearly always at least drinkable, no matter where you are.  It's my standby whenever I'm in a strange pub or bar and the 'beer' on tap is disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Historically small beer is believed to be between 2 and 3.5% ABV, based on notes from Belgian monasteries which produced small beer from the 3rd runnings of the mash and original French Saison recipes.  Those numbers are probably accurate for brewing between the middle ages and about the 1500s.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Small beer got a little stronger a few hundred years later when it came to America.  George Washington's famous 1757 Small Beer has been estimated as a little stronger, around 4-4.5% ABV by recreations.  Another famous historic small beer recipe from 1820 has been estimated around 3.8% and included lemon peel, clove, ginger, and cream of tartar for acidity in addition to hops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Basically it runs the same gamut as session beer does today, maybe staying a bit towards the lower end of what we'd consider session.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I found a &lt;a href="http://zythophile.wordpress.com/2012/01/06/caught-on-the-horns-of-a-yard-of-ale/" rel="nofollow"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; where the author has (most thoroughly, in my opinion) gone in search of some primary source of evidence for the origins of the yard glass. Unfortunately, they seem to have turned up nothing definitive.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;On one point, the post is quite consistent: there isn't any real evidence to suggest that the story of the stagecoach or mailcoach driver drinking from the yard-glass is true. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It mentions sources on the history of glassmakers:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The same absence of evidence occurs in specialist books on drinking glasses. The history  of the Worshipful Company of Glass Sellers, published in 1898, has a drawing of the Eton  “long glass”, but no coach drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And also the history of coaches:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Specialist books on coach travel also fail to supply references to coach drivers and ale-yards.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The coach explanation appears to be wholly made-up:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The earliest reference to the coach driver legend I have found is from 1952&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And, inferring from previous evidence provided by the author, this is almost a century after coach travel has been superseded by steam trains.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The author also makes an interesting point; a coach driver was almost certainly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; handed a yard of ale from the alehouse window, because the risk of breaking the glass (which would have been expensive) was too great!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most of the evidence of the post tends to suggest that the yard of ale was originally intended as a bit of a joke, and attempting to drink the whole thing without spilling a drop was a fun game to play.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;When air reaches the bulb it displaces the liquor with a splash, startling the toper, and compelling him involuntarily to withdraw his mouth by the rush of the cold liquid over his face and dress.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To summarise, in one final quote from the most-excellent article:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;But with all that, I hope you’ll agree, we have found no evidence that
					  the yard of ale was originally “designed to meet the needs of
					  stagecoach drivers” in a hurry. In fact, there is no evidence that the
					  yard of ale was ever used to refresh coach drivers at all (and if it
					  had been, it certainly wouldn’t have been handed up to the driver
					  through an inn window, which would be an excellent way to either spill
					  the ale or smash the glass). Instead, I think, it seems clear that the
					  yard of ale was (1) produced as something of a show-off, for the
					  glassmaker and the owner, and (2) primarily or almost solely supplied
					  and bought as a “forfeit glass”, for use in drinking games and
					  contests of skill, just as it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The 'stage-coach driver' explanation seems to be an &lt;em&gt;ex post facto&lt;/em&gt; explanation, almost certainly affected by the fact that a post-horn (sounded by mail-coach drivers to warn tollkeepers to open the gate so as not to delay the mails) was frequently (and genuinely) called a 'yard of tin'. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"The habit of calling the coach-horn the "yard of tin " arose from the fact that it really was a yard, or thirty-six inches, of tin, many of the old horns on the inferior coaches being made of tin, and not of copper or brass."

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/110/what-is-the-highest-alcohol-content-achievable-through-brewing?rq=1"&gt;This might be a duplicate question&lt;/a&gt;, but since as far as I know beer uses fermentation and no distillation, I expect the maximum alcohol level to be around the same maximum as for wine, which I believe is &lt;a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090518144252AA2xvY1" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;somewhere around the 13% to 15% level (by volume) as this is the level around which micro organisms seem to die&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I know some beers in the 10% to 12% range, like the Dutch &lt;a href="http://www.biernet.nl/bier/merken/grolsch-kanon" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;het Kanon ("the canon") by Grolsch&lt;/a&gt; at 11.6% and &lt;a href="http://www.biernet.nl/bier/merken/hertog-jan-grand-prestige" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Grand Prestige by Hertog Jan&lt;/a&gt; at 10%, both of which I like. They have a bit of a sweet caramel-like flavour, but I'm not sure if that related to the amount of alcohol in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There has been a bit of a battle recently, with Brewdog and Schorschbräu constantly topping each other's efforts: &lt;a href="http://www.brewdog.com/blog-article/the-battle-to-brew-the-worlds-strongest-ever-beer" rel="nofollow"&gt;BrewDog Blog.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Currently it's a &lt;strong&gt;Schorschbräu Schorschbock 57% finis coronat opus, which comes in at 57.7%&lt;/strong&gt;, beating Brewdog's latest effort: &lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/schorschbrau-schorschbock-57-finis-coronat-opus/154245/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Schorschbräu Schorschbock 57% finis coronat opus.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'd say the strongest commercially viable option &lt;em&gt;(these 50% beers only ever have a few bottles in the batch and cost a silly amount)&lt;/em&gt; in the UK anyway, is &lt;strong&gt;Watt Dickie&lt;/strong&gt;, also by Brewdog, which comes in at &lt;strong&gt;35.0%&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.brewdog.com/product/watt-dickie" rel="nofollow"&gt;BrewDog UK.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;EDIT:&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Oops, I didn't know about &lt;strong&gt;Snake Venom, 67.5%&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.brewmeister.co.uk/#/snake-venom/4580369643" rel="nofollow"&gt;Brewmeister Beer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I suppose it depends on how one defines beer. Following the German Reinheitsgebot, beer may contain only 4 ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Water&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Yeast&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Hops&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Barly malt&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beverages which do not adhere to these restrictions may not be labeled as beer in Germany, and several other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To my knowlege, the strongest beer of kind is &lt;a href="http://www.benz-weltweit.de/derbraeuvomberch/index2.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Schorschbock 57&lt;/a&gt;, an ice-distilled doppelbock with 57,5% alcohol content.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It depends on your definition, commercially available is Kwak, around the same as wine, if you go to the Grand Place it comes in those horse &amp;amp; cart designed bulbous glasses (like a mini yard of ale). Once you go above that the others are all pretty specialist.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From what I understand, Shandies as we see them now are more similar to the German Radler.  Radler means cyclist in German.  The way I understand the story is that a small pub owner was besieged one day by a slew of thirsty cyclists and knew that his beer supply wouldn't hold out, so he cut it by mixing it with some sort of lemon drink he had on hand.  As far as I know this origin story isn't confirmed and Radler likely grew out of folk attempts to "sessionize" and extend the supply of leftover lager through the summer when lower alcohol and more refreshing drinks were wanted.  According to wikipedia the first printed mention of Radler as a drink was in 1912: &lt;a href="http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/4594/20" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Lena Christ: Erinnerungen einer Überflüssigen - Kapitel 20&lt;/a&gt;. I believe contemporary Radlers use a lemon-soda sort of drink that's more like a carbonated lemonade than what we'd think of as soda.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Shandy itself is short for Shandygaff which is a British English term from the mid-1800s referring to beer cut with ginger beer or ginger ale. In fact, the OED still defines it as such while Mariam-Webster has loosened it up and allows for any non-alcoholic drink to be used in place of ginger.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As to their reputation, if you'll forgive me a little supposition, most commercial shandies are very pale duplications of mixing lemonade (or lemon soda) with a beer yourself.  The first commercial example I saw was Lienenkugel's and it was abusively sweet.  Sam Adams and The Traveler have fared a little better, but I think a major problem is that to commercially produce a shandy you need to heavily filter and pasteurize the beer and lemonade  to make sure the sugar doesn't ferment or use a non-fermentable sugar, which would change the taste from fresh beer and fresh lemonade.  At the scale a lot of breweries operate at, it possible some of them aren't even using real lemonade regardless of sugar type.  Also, while continuously popular in Europe, beer cocktails never caught on or were lost in America and we tend to think of them now as marketing gimmicks by macro-brewers (Bud Light Lime, Bud Chelada, Miller Chill), though as they become more visible, I think they'll become more accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, fresh shandy is incredible, I like using wheat beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trappist_beer"&gt;Trappist beer&lt;/a&gt; is a designation of the origin of the beer, rather than a designation for the style.  That is, it must come from one of the ten Trappist monasteries &lt;a href="http://www.trappist.be/en/pages/trappist-beers"&gt;recognised by the International Trappist Association&lt;/a&gt;.  There are similarities between the styles produced by these monasteries, but if one decided to make something in a completely different style it could presumably still be called a Trappist beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the term &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_in_Belgium#Abbey_beers"&gt;abbey beer&lt;/a&gt; is used to refer to any beers produced in the style of the Trappist monasteries.  It isn't necessarily produced by a monastery, and some beers produced by major breweries could be described as abbey beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is kind of like the difference between "Champagne" and "sparkling white wine".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ginger beer is not just water, sugar, crushed ginger and  yeast. I make it with some spices boilled in water to flavour it, some of it to kill off the yeast if I want it to. KIlling off the yeast makes it an ale ; and cider must have apples or apple juice in it.  That's my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There's a good explanation of the 'X' as it pertains to whiskey over at &lt;a href="http://www.moonshineheritage.com/blog/what-does-the-xxx-on-moonshine-jugs-mean/" rel="nofollow"&gt;MoonshineHeritage&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, the number of X's indicates the number of times the whiskey was run through the still back when very simple pot stills were commonly used. The correlation to quality is probably based on the notion that the purer the alcohol the better the quality of the whiskey.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;X's and K's actually derive from turn of the last century British brewing practices where the letters and how often they were repeated denoted the basic style and relative strength of the beer.  See more &lt;a href="http://barclayperkins.blogspot.com/2009/01/beer-code.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The more in depth answer is that back then malting and kilning practices weren't as good so you generally just ended up with "Malt", which was kindof brownish but varied wildly.  So you just sort of made "Beer" out of it.  X Ales were table beer, made to be consumed relatively fresh, and K Ales were keeping beer made to be kept.  Hopping rates likely differed as well as starting strength.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think at some point later X came to denote "mild" ale, which referred to a lower hopping rate and K/AK/etc came to refer to "bitter", but the blogger I linked to above knows more about that progression than I ever will so I may be totally wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;IMHO, I would classify ciders, perrys, and meads to be more like wine than beer -- they are made by fermenting fruit or honey without substantial change to the base ingredients. Beer is made from malted grain, which must first be mashed to convert starch into fermentable sugars. Beer must contain 4 essential ingredients: Malt extract (from the grain), hops, water and yeast. It may contain others as well, but if any of these four are missing it is not beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think that your premise of "that alcoholic drinks are essentially either Beers Wines or Spirits." is wrong because it oversimplifies and excludes some beverages. Besides mead and cider, there are also malt-based alcho-pop beverages (Mike's Hard Lemon, Twisted Tea, etc.) that I would not call beer either - they contain 3 of the four ingredients, but lack hops. There are other local indigenous alcoholic beverages around the world that don't fit any of these categories, like Japanese sake.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are many styles of beer -- so the word "beer" refers to all of them, and there is no style that is called just "beer". Here is a link that describes many styles of beer, mead and cider. Note that this is not a comprehensive list; brewers keep developing new styles all the time to create desirable products. For example, Black IPAs came into vogue a couple of years ago, now I am seeing White IPAs.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is quite simple.
					Beer is made off starch (read: the alcohol)
					and Wines are made from fruit's sugar (fructose and glucose).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think the main difference is that beer is brewed - you have to steep the grain in water. You don't do this for meads or wines. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer generally refers to the fermented product of malted grains, yeast, water, and hops. An incredible variety of beers are derived from only these key ingredients, though many brewers do add additional ingredients called adjuncts (fruit, spices, herbs, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Mead is the product of fermented honey, sometimes called "honey wine", and is more comparable to the wine family (including cider and fruit wines) than beer in terms of body, alcohol, bitterness, base sugars, and typically effervescence.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The term "cider" is generally reserved for apples.  There are 'pear ciders' such as Woodchuck that use the name, but as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cider"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; points out, "A similar product made from pears is called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry"&gt;perry&lt;/a&gt; but sometimes (incorrectly) called Pear Cider in the marketing of some producers' products".  I personally can forgive this, since pears are closely related to apples, and the result is quite tasty.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The "beer" part of ginger beer is due to the fermentation process involved in its creation.  In this way, it is more similar to "root beer", since ginger is a root, like the sassafras root used in root beer and birch roots used in birch beer.  The website todayifoundout.com has a well referenced article for &lt;a href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/07/why-root-beer-is-called-that/"&gt;Why Root Beer is Called That&lt;/a&gt; covering the naming of root beer.  If the ginger based version isn't fermented, but is instead ginger flavouring added to carbonated water, it would be "ginger ale"; I have no idea why, since an India Pale Ale is certainly fermented.  Even with ginger products, the differentiation is not really all that terribly strict, as noted by this &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/20/ginger-ale-vs-ginger-beer_n_1438420.html"&gt;Huffington Post article&lt;/a&gt;.  Initially, ginger beer, root beer, birch beer, etc, were frequently alcoholic, but Prohibition ruined that for the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a bit of a side note, the alcoholic versions are making a wonderful comeback (in my personal opinion) with &lt;a href="https://www.sprecherbrewery.com/hrb.php"&gt;Sprecher's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://smalltownbrewery.com/?page_id=11"&gt;Small Town Brewery&lt;/a&gt; for root beer.  I personally have not seen as much alcoholic ginger beer, but &lt;a href="http://www.crabbiesgingerbeer.co.uk/"&gt;Crabbies&lt;/a&gt; from the U.K. is quite good.  Although I personally do not like &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/697/24751/"&gt;Kuchi's ginger beer&lt;/a&gt;, I have several friends who absolutely love it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Actually, there are still people who brew the same way people did before the discovery of yeast, so we have a pretty good idea how it worked. There are also data from early 20-th century ethnological surveys where brewers describe their methods. Some of the equipment used for yeast transfer is still in use, or in ethnological museums.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;People usually didn't brew that often, so they couldn't transfer the yeast cake itself. Instead, they would collect yeast from the previous brew and either keep it in a jar that they kept cool, for example in a well, or by drying it on a wooden log, piece of linen, straw ring, etc etc etc. There were lots of methods, but they basically boil down to either keeping wet or dry yeast. Odd Nordland's 1969 book is the only detailed source of information on this that I know; unfortunately it's near-impossible to get hold of.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, this type of yeast and yeast use only survives in two places: the Lithuanian province of Aukstatija, and western Norway (specfically, Hardanger, Voss, and Sunnmøre).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've written &lt;a href="http://www.garshol.priv.no/blog/264.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;a summary of what's known of Norwegian practices&lt;/a&gt;, and earlier this year I was able to brew with a brewer who still uses his family's ancestral yeast strain. I've published &lt;a href="http://www.garshol.priv.no/blog/291.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;an account of that brewing session&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I hope people will forgive me for linking to my own stuff here. I don't know of any other detailed sources of information on the web anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As your link indicates there is evidence of beer going back to around 5000 BC, however, this is only the first time that it is known to have been recorded. Alcoholic drinks made by naturally fermenting fruit are drunk by monkeys and elephants and probably long pre-date the evolution of humans. Evidence of breads, which could result in a type of beer if allowed to ferment in the same way as the fruits if the mixture was left with yeast in too long, exists from 30,000 years and pre-dates the advent writing ( &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bread"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bread&lt;/a&gt; ). It is likely therefore that beers existed tens of thousands of years ago through accident at first and eventually design and were likely to be similar to traditional African beers such as the Kenyan busaa, which by coincidence is still made by my girlfriend's grandmother for the elder men of her tribe. I.e. these beers would be a form of thick, alcoholic liquid bread. In other words we cannot know who "invented" beer as &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;it probably pre-dates written language and&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;it wasn't "invented" by anyone really it was made serendipitously at first.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;the date was probably some time over 20,000 years ago but that is unknowable for the same reasons.
					Interestingly, as it is a drink made from a cheap foodstuff that was widely consumed by the people rather than by nobility who could record such things, it is not known who invented lager either. It is likely that Lambics were the precursors of Lagers though.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As MD-Tech mentioned, beer wasn't exactly invented. However, the answer of when seems to be that it followed the production of wine. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here's a clip from a paper I had written a while back.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Based on available evidence, it is likely that S. cerevisiae was first used in the production of wine. DNA evidence dates winemaking to 3150 BC, and the earliest molecular evidence available indicates winemaking having taken place at least as early as 7000 BC in China. (Fay J. C. and Benavides J. A. 2005)&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One issue with production of alcohol is that it takes away precious food supplies and so is a lot easier to produce when agriculture is in place than when it is not.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The bulk of what they drank would have been small beer: very low alcohol content beer. It was often unfiltered. This was more or less consumed daily instead of water, since there was no sanitation at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also bear in mind that beers back then were made out of lots of ingredients that we'd think of as odd.  Cock ale was obviously a thing, which was beer that was fermented (or boiled) with a rooster in it.  Lots of beers would also have been strained through spruce post-boil which would've given them some wood or pine quality.  Lots of other flowers were often involved.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Check out George Washington's small beer recipe &lt;a href="http://www.beerhistory.com/library/holdings/washingtonrecipe.shtml" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Though this is a poor transcription and a lot of folks agree that it should read "Bran, Hops to taste", it's still clear that the grain is sort of a "for taste, whatever you can spare" thing while the molasses is the star of the show.  A lot of early drinks were like that, involving some sort of concentrated or burnt sugar in addition to grains, which generally weren't barley at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, in the most ideal case where you had access to the best beer you could find...it would be some form of brown ale or lighter porter.  Maybe an amber ale if you could find one that wasn't very hoppy.  The stable kilning process that enabled people to make pale malt wasn't really invented until the mid-1600's and wasn't very popular until the 1700s, so brewers in the 1600s would've used a sort of generic-y brown malt that might taste slightly burnt and premium beers may have been able to include some lighter malt that was much harder to make and find.  And it'd probably still have some molasses in it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer was commonly drunk in the Elizabethan period in Europe, but what they drank is different from the beer we're used to today.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer and ale, being grain-based, were important dietary staples -- it's said that beer is liquid bread, and that's not far off.  For the common man (not nobility), in particular, grain made up a substantial part of the diet, with meat being fairly rare.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Common beer was not aged for months or years like some beers today; rather, a batch might be produced in as little as half a week.  These are "small beers" (or "small ales", for the unhopped variety), which are mildly alcoholic but drinkable in volume without unfortunate effects.  These small beers/ales were produced in the home/manor; it was just one more task for the cooks.  See, for example, Markham's &lt;em&gt;The English Housewife&lt;/em&gt;, 1615. (I don't know of an online copy, sorry.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Note that this means that the pilgrims wouldn't have brought beer from Europe; it'd be consumed, or probably go bad, before they reached the new world. So they probably didn't have beer in their &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; year because they'd need to wait for a grain harvest.  After that, if they brought hops with them then they could have made small beers like from the old country; if they didn't bring hops, they probably made ales instead.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Turkey would have been new to their palates (it's a new-world bird), but beer was commonly drunk with meals where they came from, and those meals sometimes included other fowl.  So, probably it pairs fine.  However, they probably didn't care as much about the proper pairing as we might today, the same as we might not care about pairing the proper cola with the turkey sandwich we have for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer is fermented typically (but not exclusively) via yeast.  When live beer yeast, actually a fungus, is present, it creates a hostile environment for (potentially harmful) bacteria reducing their prevalence.  Therefore, fresh beer could be considered a safer alternative to say, river water.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's true. There's been big debates over to what degree they were aware that water caused diseases while beer did not, but a big factor was that beer was seen as nourishing (which it is) while water was not. In an age where getting enough to eat was a recurring challenge, this contributed to making people prefer beer/wine. In practice it seems people preferred alcoholic drinks for both reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Generally, people would drink small beer as an everyday drink against thirst (and that's what children got, too), and beer proper for celebrations. That's actually a Finnish saying: "small beer for work, beer for celebration" ("Kaljalla työt tehdään, oluella pidot pidetään").&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Small beer was generally made together with beer. That is, they'd do a mash, and the first wort that's run off has the most sugar. As you keep pouring water through, obviously more and more sugar is washed out of the malts, and the wort keeps getting waterier. Eventually they'd stop, and make beer from the wort. Then they'd continue, and run off a much weaker wort from the remaining sugar in the malts. This was the small beer. Many places they would even do a third beer, which was so weak it would barely ferment. There were also other grain-based drinks, made from flour or bread, and typically sour and just barely alcoholic. Kvass is the best-known example, but there were many others.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Weak beer as an every-day drink continued for much longer than you might think. It was the introduction of tea/coffee that first started displacing it. Then, later, higher availability of milk, then juices and soft drinks continued the process. On Gotland, off the coast of Sweden, children were drinking weak beer as late as the 1960s. I lack data for exactly when this ended elsewhere, but it was long, long after the Middle Ages.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Trappist Monks sold beer to support the monasteries. There is no order for the monks to abstain from alcoholso they use the money raised to support the monks and the abbey in which they live. People really liked the unique flavors of the Belgium Trappist Monk's beer and it became its own style.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most of the time you will see home-brewers air-lock their fermentors so wild yeast cannot spoil the beer. The strains of yeast that have been cultivated for centuries inside the abbey walls have given the Belgian beers their unique flavors.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Brewing in monasteries did a lot to keep brewing more of a passion thing than big business. The monks of the Trappist monasteries were largely concerned with just keeping afloat and contributing to charitable works than expanding and making huge piles of cash so their brews don't need to worry about using using malts that are too expensive or things like that. It stopped adjunct malts from showing up in the brews and watering them down.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;By the time worldwide distribution became a thing their own styles had been engrained for so long that high quality beer had become a tradition that nobody was willing to leave behind. Sure there are some crappy beers like Stella Artois, but the vast majority of Belgian beer is awesome stuff like Chimay, Corsendonk or Rochefort now.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There's also a pretty big culture there of pairing beer with food and even cooking with beer. Its just deeply engrained in every day life for them, not just as a way to get drunk and be merry but of simply enjoying your breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A couple other things contribute to the Belgian beer culture:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;They didn't have to follow the (pointlessly restrictive) Reinheitsgebot, thus allowing the use of fruit, spices, Belgian 'candi' sugar (and probably other things).&lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When one speaks of "Belgian brewing", one must distinguish between two major styles of beer: the famous abbey ales produced by Trappist orders in Belgium (and now one in America), and the the saisons and bières de garde produced as inexpensive nutritional supplements and dietary staples for farm life. An interest in the history and production of these beers is best served by Phil Markowski's &lt;em&gt;Farmhouse Ales&lt;/em&gt; and Stan Hieronymus' &lt;em&gt;Brew Like a Monk&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To touch on a few of your questions:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As previously alluded, beer served a utilitarian purpose as a dietary staple and nutritional supplement for an agrarian society. Beer was frequently brewed in large batches at regular intervals in support of farm life, and the result were table beers and saisons for work during the harvest and &lt;em&gt;bières de garde&lt;/em&gt; (loosely translated: "beers for keeping") to survive the winters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abbey ales are not as varied as they initially appear. Much of the variation in beers brewed in Trappist style come from fermenting different "runnings" of the same batches of wort (unfermented beer); to summarize &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; briefly, the strength is dependent upon the sugar content which is dependent on how many times the mashed malt has been "rinsed". See Wikipedia's page on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lautering" rel="nofollow"&gt;lautering&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belgian and English brewing are actually &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; very dissimilar from a historical perspective, and there was quite a bit of overlap in technique between English, Belgian, and Flandrian brewers. The differences in style we perceive now (e.g. IPAs vs Flemish sours) evolved by regional taste preferences from common roots: malt-forward beers (which were originally quite sour) using the low alpha acid noble hops which thrived on the continent. Consider the similarities in taste and composition between an ESB and a dubbel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In addition to the above referenced works, a quick read through the history section of Jeff Sparrow's &lt;em&gt;Wild Brews&lt;/em&gt; should answer any remaining questions you might have about the history of Franco-Belgian beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Vielle Bon Secours ale I think.  It's a Belgian beer brewed by Caulier.  I saw the bottle in London 6 years ago, and it'll cost you around US$1,165.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;as mentioned above but with more details: the most expensive beer is a 12 liter bottle of Vieille Bon Secours which was stocked in a London restaurant for over 10 years. So it's the age and uniqueness of this one bottle that make it worth around 700£ / 832€.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think it would be right to say that lagers were discovered rather than invented. Lager yeast is apparently the result of an unlikely mating of ale yeast and a wild yeast from South America. It's ability to ferment at lower temperatures probably led to its establishment in some brewery in some cold part of Bohemia centuries ago.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;According to Wikipedia, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lager"&gt;lagering&lt;/a&gt; became more commercially viable with the appearance of refrigeration systems. But &lt;a href="http://www.brewerspublications.com/books/yeast-the-practical-guide-to-beer-fermentation/"&gt;White &amp;amp; Zainasheff&lt;/a&gt; describe why this was desired. After Pasteur showed that yeast are responsible for fermentation, the Carlsberg brewery isolated &lt;em&gt;S. carlsbergensis&lt;/em&gt;, now known as &lt;em&gt;S. pastorianus&lt;/em&gt;, for commercial use. This is a lager yeast, and since many ales were brewed with mixed (&lt;em&gt;S cerevisiae&lt;/em&gt; plus wild yeasts, bacteria) cultures, it created the perception was that lager, as a style, was cleaner than ale, and the improved shelf life made it a more attractive product to produce. And so, lagers took over the beer world after that, despite so many small breweries that make high quality ales. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a few. You can definitely start with the wikipedia and BeerAdvocate articles suggested by other posters, but for books, I'd recommend the following.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Beer: A Global History by Gavin Smith gives a good overview and world perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;-A Brewer's Tale: A History of the World According to Beer by William Bostwick focuses more on the effect beer has had on civilization, rather than the other way around&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;-The Audacity of Hops: The History of America's Craft Beer Revolution by Tom Acitelli is a great prohibition-to-now perspective on American beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The answer is probably the dawn of human civilization.  Beer was probably one of the first consumables ever commercialized.  We can find commercial receipts for the sale of beer dating back over 4,000 years (Alulu beer receipt, 2050 BC) and advertisements for beer from even further back (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebla_tablets" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ebla Tablets, 2500-2250 BC&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hammurabi's Code from ~1750 BC has several sections detailing punishments for bartenders who try to short-change their customers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Realistically, beer has probably been a commercial product for longer than it hasn't.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A saison would be the closest if you want "authenticity". This soup was usually a breakfast dish made with very weak farmhouse style ale often served to farm workers. The beers were locally brewed often by the farmers themselves. It only had about 3-4% abv so even today's commercial saisons have a bit more (5-8% abv). Sometimes kvas was used. Kvas is a light brew made from fermenting stale/dried bread (1-3% abv).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's sort of tough to chase down the origins of this stuff.  It likely grew out of wine competition judging, which itself may have been based on the internal QA process of breweries and wineries.  But that's conjecture, I can't find anything concrete.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The best information I've got is that the websites like BA and RateBeer use the criteria set down by the American Homebrewers' Association and the Beer Judge Certification Program (AHA/BJCP).  The BJCP was formed in 1985, but their style descriptions were likely based on Michael Jackson's famous book: The World Guide To Beer, published in 1977.  But realistically it just sort of makes sense...describe how it looks, how it smells, how it tastes, how fizzy/thick/thin it feels, and then any ephemeral qualities it has to give an impression of the beer.  Pretty much covers all the bases.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In 1821, the four Rodenbach brothers (Pedro, Alexander, Ferdinand and Constantijn) invested in a small brewery in Roeselare, in the West Flanders province of Belgium. The brothers agreed to a partnership for 15 years. At the end of this period, Pedro and his wife, Regina Wauters, bought the brewery from the others and Regina ran the business while Pedro served in the military. Their son Edward later took over the brewery (1864) and, it was during his directorship that the brewery saw great growth.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Edward's son, Eugene, took over in 1878 and, in preparation for this position, travelled to England where he learned how to ripen beer in oak barrels and then mix old and young beers. It was this that became the method of producing beer that Rodenbach became famous for. As Eugene produced no male offspring, a public limited liability corporation was created and most shares remained in the hands of descendants of the Rodenbachs until 1998 when the brewery was sold to Palm Brewery.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are 4 different types of Rodenbach beers:
					 1. Rodenbach Original (5,2% ABV) blended from aged and young ale (25%/75%);
					 2. Rodenbach Grand Cru, a rich winey beer (6% ABV) which, although blended, contains less young ale (67%/33%) (in the past this beer was unblended aged beer from a single cask selected for its qualities by a tasting panel. This type of beer has now been renamed Rodenbach Vintage beer and is available in limited quantities);
					 3. Vin de Céréale, an aged beer that is 10% ABV.
					 4. In commemoration of the brewery 150th year of activity, it produced Rodenbach Alexander (5,2% ABV). It was a variant of the Original one with a cherry taste. It is name comes from the brewery founder Alexander Rodenbach.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;After the take-over, Palm quickly stopped the production of Rodenbach's Alexander beer, a cherry-flavoured beer.&lt;a href="http://www.realbeer.com/news/articles/news-000720.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="Palm Explains Plans for Rodenbach Beers"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; When Palm Brewery bought Rodenbach, another brewery it owned already made a cherry beer. At that time Alexander Rodenbach had to be ceased for contractual non-compete sorts of reasons. However, in recent years, Palm/Rodenbach has produced and distributed, first, Rodenbach foederbier, which is served only from cask, and is unfiltered and unblended. It comes straight from an oak riping barrel and is not processed further.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think the bartender told you to drink your Rodenbach with a shot of cherry liquor, so that you can taste the original Rodenbach Alexander (the cherry-flavoured beer, Rodenbach's erstwhile cherry beer which produced before the brewery was sold to Palm). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure about the German market for craft, but American craft can almost certainly be traced back to Frederick Maytag's purchase of San Francisco's Anchor Brewing in 1965. Since then, 'craft' or 'microbrew' grew slowly through the years.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A lengthy but interesting report called &lt;a href="http://www.angelfire.com/al4/tato/subsite/images/Market%20for%20Craft%20and%20Specialty%20Beer%2097.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;THE MARKET FOR CRAFT AND SPECIALTY BEER, A Market Intelligence Report, March 1997&lt;/a&gt; has an impressive description of why craft in particular was able to keep growing, and why it wasn't labeled a 'fad':&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"There is also a floor under the craft/specialty segment. This is not
					  a fad segment like packaged draft, dry, ice, clear, or perhaps even
					  red. While growth in the craft segment will slow, it will not peak
					  quickly and then lose share, as the fad beers have. The
					  craft/specialty segment has firm underpinnings from homebrewers and
					  other beer aficionados. Many of the homebrewers prefer to brew their
					  own beer (done right, it’s even better than the best of the craft
					  brews), but they often sample commercial brews to try unfamiliar or
					  difficult-to-brew styles, and of course they’re top prospects for
					  drinking craft brews when they are at a restaurant or brewpub."&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That explains a lot through the 90's, but why the quicker increase in growth patterns in the last 10 years?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.brewersassociation.org/news/ba-insider-growth-craft-beer-segment-sky-limit/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Brewers Association&lt;/a&gt; (a US-based trade group): &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"Between 2011 and 2013, 80% of craft growth came from new craft
					  appreciators, the majority of which were in the 21 to 29 age group,
					  and their impact is still muted. Lester Jones of the National Beer
					  Wholesalers Association (NBWA) sees Millennials as not fully
					  economically activated yet due to the impact of the economic recession
					  and their struggle to transition into aging Baby Boomer jobs. This
					  means as the economy improves we should feel the impact of the
					  Millennials even more. The message here is the fastest growing and
					  most influential demographic is also moving the fastest toward craft."&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Pair this with the increased ideals behind "Trade-ups and premiumization", and you have people willing to spend a little more to gain an perceived increase in value and quality.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/craft-beer-production.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;IBISWorld&lt;/a&gt; shares that craft beer has enjoyed a 19% growth in the past 5 years. I don't know about you, but that's incredible considering the economic woes of developed nations. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It appears to boil down to a long, slow pattern of growth that has reached a massive generational shift in consumption which has caused a spike in sales volume, which in turn is pushing every store from New Jersey to Frankfurt to attempt to capitalize on one of the few growth industries.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You are correct that in countries like France and Italy, beer consumption is replaced by much higher wine consumption.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Why?  Because they can.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's a cultural difference that has been developed and ingrained over many centuries, back to when trade was more limited and more difficult, and Northern Europe was colder than it is today.   For much of that time, the climate in Southern Europe was ideal for growing grapes and producing wine, while it was simply too cold further north. So, Southern Europe produced and drank wine, Northern Europe produced and drank beer, thus creating regional preferences that persist even to this day.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer is not always bitter, but the bitterness (usually from the hops) is there to counter the sweetness of the malt.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some beers, like the Belgian Strong Ales, tend to be malty &amp;amp; sweet, with just enough bitterness to but the sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beers become sweeter with age, as the hops (and the bitterness) drop out, leaving only the malty sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Gruit (beers made without hops) use different herbs to give bitterness to the beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is rather hard to say what should be in beer making as much of beer making is just a exercise in the personals taste of the brewer but yes a certain level of bitterness is required to counter act the sugars that need to be present for fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is curious to note that much to the chagrin of the Lowlanders some of the earliest beer history dates from the Roman empire. These types of beers did not use hops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The hop beers dated from 8th century and was first developed in Germany. It was not long before the new technology in brewing spread to Neighboring Belgium and a little while there after it jumped the channel to the British island. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is was evident from a early stage in the history of brewing that these hops where only made in a handful of places in the old world and the beer culture centered around these places.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Goldbach Valley in western Bohemia, near the town of Saaz, and the Mittelfrüh subregion of the Hallertau being the most famous.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That being said northern Italy is busy with a nice beer renascence &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So I'm going to assume you mean historically...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_beer" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; has a ton of good info but basically, beer was originally a very sweet beverage due to the wild yeast and under modified malt that was used in the brewing process.  To combat the sweetness, brewers would use &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruit" rel="nofollow"&gt;Gruit&lt;/a&gt; which is an herb mixture to bitter the beer. &lt;a href="http://www.beerscenemag.com/2010/04/the-short-and-bitter-history-of-hops/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Hops were also used as a bittering agent&lt;/a&gt;, but not to the same extent as gruit.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In 1842, the first &lt;a href="http://braukaiser.com/wiki/index.php?title=German_Brewing_between_1850_and_1900_:_Malting_and_Wort_Production" rel="nofollow"&gt;Pilsner&lt;/a&gt; was brewed, a style which showcases hops and is very pale in color which was revolutionary at the time.  This style took Europe by storm and the &lt;a href="http://www.craftbeer.com/the-beverage/history-of-beer/the-american-story" rel="nofollow"&gt;migrating Germans&lt;/a&gt; to the US brought this taste for hoppy pilsners with them to the US.  There were many competing styles that were popular in the US up until Prohibition.
					 After prohibition, the breweries that were still in business chose to produce the beers that appeal to the widest consumer base, I.E. Pilsner drinkers. This is the raison d'etre for the very large breweries.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for the bitterness in beer, the most common factor is &lt;a href="http://www.craftbeer.com/craft-beer-muses/birth-of-a-hop" rel="nofollow"&gt;Hops&lt;/a&gt;.  Hops contain different acids (&lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/cep/HopVarieties.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alpha, Beta, Myrcente, etc)&lt;/a&gt; that bitter beer in different ways.  The type, quantity and usage of hops in the brewing process can affect the bitterness of beer.
					That being said, some styles don't use a lot of hops if at all.  Scottish/Irish ales, for instance, don't have much hop flavor due to the lack of &lt;a href="http://www.realbeer.com/library/authors/tierney-jones-a/scottishales.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;availability of hops in the region&lt;/a&gt;.  Other styles originate from locations that have &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicha" rel="nofollow"&gt;never seen hops&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps.  Never be afraid to try new things.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the case of France it is more or less how is says in the accepted answer. In the case of Italy they consume in general little alcohol for European standards:
					&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption_per_capita" rel="nofollow"&gt;List of countries by alcohol consumption per capita (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This can also be observed when there (which I am a lot). Cafes are popular which do in general also serve alcohol, but in the evening it usually remains at one drink often an Aperitif (Aperol Spritz for example) or a single beer or a glass of wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First off, I don't know if this story is in fact true, but I can shed some light on the subject which would indicate that it is certainly plausible.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hops were first used to flavor beer around 1000 A.D., starting in Germany.  Until this time beer was flavored with a mix of herbs and spices called "gruit" which was taxed (generally by either the government or the Roman Catholic Church) and in many cases required by law, so when hops did appear, they appears in regions where the church had less control.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hops didn't make their way to England until around 1500 A.D., and weren't universally used until around the year 1600.   Since Henry VIII reigned from 1509 until 1547, it would have been early in the introduction of hops to the region, and it is certainly within the realm of possibility that he may have outlawed them as a threat to the tax revenue stream provided by the sale of gruit.   Eventually though, demand for hops won out, and Henry's own wars with the Catholic Church may have weakened the ability to gruit rights-holders to continue to monopolize the market, and as I mentioned, by fifty years after Henry's death, hops ultimately won the war.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the beginning most in Western Europe drank beer,the Romans however started converting to wine. It wasn't long before the idea spread that wine was somehow more sophisticated, contrary to beer, which was only drunk by Barbarians. After Caesars conquest of Gaul. The Gauls were quickly romanized. It is clear that the romanized parts drink less beer and more wine, and the Germanic area produces more  beer (+ the Belgian region which were there was a lot of germanic immigration). The reason Spain produces a lot of beer is probably because the relative dryness and infertile grounds make it not ideal to grow wine (largest area of wineyards, only third in production).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Trappist designation is monitored by the International Trappist Association. Here are the criteria set forth by them for an abbey to maintain their Trappist label:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beer must be brewed within the walls of a Trappist monastery, either by the monks themselves or under their supervision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brewery must be of secondary importance within the monastery and it should witness to the business practices proper to a monastic way of life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brewery is not intended to be a profit-making venture. The income covers the living expenses of the monks and the maintenance of the buildings and grounds. Whatever remains is donated to charity for social work and to help persons in need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Trappist breweries are constantly monitored to assure the irreproachable quality of their beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It seems like it just is like that without a very specific reason. Trappists are often Belgian-style (Tripels and Dubbels) beers and Belgium has a very rich beer culture. Most of Trappist monasteries are in Belgium France and Spain and those countries do not really have a long-lasting beer tradition. There are also numerous monasteries in US but the beer tradition/culture there is not extremely old. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;note&lt;/em&gt; I don't want to judge on different beer regions and I am just speaking of the  history and not present times, but I think it is fair to say that some regions beer culture is not as old as others.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trappists"&gt;Trappists&lt;/a&gt; are members of a Roman Catholic religious order. Trappists follow a rule of St. Benedict stating that they should "live by the work of their hands", which means many Trappist monasteries sell goods for income. The order has no particular prohibition against alcohol, so producing beer is an entirely reasonable profession for the monks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The order is centuries old, and originated in France. However, many of the French breweries were destroyed during the French revolution (and later, the world wars). Fortunately for us today, the monasteries in the beer-loving Belgium survived (or in cases like that of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochefort_Abbey"&gt;Rochefort Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, were restored).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Today, the "Authentic Trappist Product" logo, which defines a "real" Trappist beer, is owned by the International Trappist Association, an organization founded in 1997. The founding members include six abbeys from Belgium, one from the Netherlands, and one from Germany (which doesn't produce beer). It is only in very recent years that the ITA has expanded to recognize breweries aside from the original 7, the first "new" one being Stift Engelszell from Austria in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As the craft beer revolution pushes forward, I'd say we're likely to see more monasteries start their own beer production and apply for the logo. But right now, it's still mostly the original Belgians.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The explication to your question is multi-faceted and not so easy to understand if one is neither Roman Catholic nor understanding of the nuances of religious life (Trappist). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trappists" rel="nofollow"&gt;Trappists&lt;/a&gt; were founded in 1664 as a branch of the Benedictine Order at the La Trappe Abbey. The abbot of La Trappe has a greater authority of jurisdiction than the other trappist abbots. Under canon law this is permitted because La Trappe is the motherhouse of the Trappist Order. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The history of the Trappist Foundation in 1997 is of a totally different perspective. Originally only La Trappe Abbey could grant the title of the label to those &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trappist_beer" rel="nofollow"&gt;Trappist breweries&lt;/a&gt; which could safeguard the integrity of the Order. All other monasteries which could not or would not abide to the conditions to be met, would not be granted the Trappist Label. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Since 2012, four other Trappist monasteries have been added to the list, including St. Joseph's Abbey in Massachusetts, United States.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The three basic rules for granting the label are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The beer must be brewed within the monastery, by the monks or at least under the supervision of the monks.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The making of ales should be of a secondary importance to the monastery and should be seen as a witness of monastic life.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Any profits from the brewery are to be use to help sustain the monks in their life of prayer. Any extra income is to be given to some sort of charity.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There seems to be no other Trappist Abbeys that were producing beer at the time the label was founded. Since abbeys are independent of one another, sources of revenue are not limited to the brewing of ales. Some abbeys made vestments, while other distilled products such as kirsch, as was the case at Fontgombault Abbey from 1849-1905. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontgombault_Abbey" rel="nofollow"&gt;Fontgombault Abbey (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That's a very broad question, and hard to answer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Very early on, hops weren't well known, and beer was made without hops; this likely would have caused the beer to be sweeter than it is today. Hops were known and added to beer relatively early in the Middle Ages, though.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Today, in my opinion, the key differences are variety and technology. Not only do we have a greater variety in styles, but we have more varieties of hops, malts, and different yeasts. These create wildly different flavor profiles unheard of centuries ago. Technology has allowed us to create more consistency in beers, as well as increasing variety indirectly through different techniques used in brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here's a pretty nice article on the history of beer: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_beer" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_beer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And if you want to try some beers brewed in traditional styles, they are out there. Here's a good list of some of the best: &lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beerstyles/traditional-ale/59/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.ratebeer.com/beerstyles/traditional-ale/59/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not only has variety improved, but so has the technology and agronomy of brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Malt variety, yield, and efficiency&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Crop science has increased the size of barley kernels and the amount of starches available to convert to sugar.  The common grain at the time was 6-row malt, today the most &lt;a href="http://www.homebrewersassociation.org/zymurgy/zymurgy-extra-2-row-vs-6-row-barley/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;common brewing barley is 2-row&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Understanding of the malting process has drastically improved. Today we understand how to &lt;a href="http://www.brewery.org/brewery/library/Malt.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;get perfectly malted barley&lt;/a&gt;. Historically the malt would have been over or under modified.  Under modified would have lots of unconverted starch which would leave a hazy beer that tasted rather bready. Over modified malt would would have no starch, but less sugar than possible so the resulting beer may lack body.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Kiln dryers allow for greater variety of malt. By controlling the heat cycle, the same variety of &lt;a href="http://hbd.org/brewery/library/Malt_AK0996.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;barley can make different malt&lt;/a&gt;.  Drying the grain in medieval times consisted of heating it over a fire.  Fire dried grains would have a smokey flavor that would be present in the beer.  The traditional Scottish Ale uses malt that has been dried over a fire where the fuel is peat, which is a very distinct smoke flavor.  The fire also was not nearly as exact or even as a modern kiln so some kernels would be burnt and other may be under cooked, so to speak. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Water&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Needless to say, but water purity is drastcally better today than in the 6th-15th centuries.  Because the brewing process boils the water, the beer was safer to drink than the water. Hence the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_of_Soissons" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;patron saint of brewers&lt;/a&gt; said "Drink beer, not water."&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Dissolved mineral content of water and pH control.  Medieval brewers had the water that they had.  Today, a brewer can start with distilled water and add whatever minerals they desire to change the flavor profile and pH of the mash.  The water pH can effect the mash efficiency and fermentation profile of the beer.  This lack of water control lead to specific styles coming from specific areas. I.E. Burton upon Trent is known for pale ales, Pilsen for golden pilsners, Munich for malty lagers.&lt;a href="http://howtobrew.com/book/section-3/understanding-the-mash-ph/balancing-the-malts-and-minerals" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Some water source mineral content.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Hops&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Ancient beers were not hoppy. Hops were not used extensively in beer until about the 12th century and were not cultivated en mass until about the &lt;a href="http://www.britishhops.org.uk/history-of-hops/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;13th century&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/a/4643/4637"&gt;Most beers older than that were bittered with Gruit.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The hops that were used were not high in bittering acids.  The oldest common hop varieties are the &lt;a href="http://beersmith.com/blog/2012/02/05/noble-hops-for-european-beer-styles/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Noble hops&lt;/a&gt;.  Just like today, costs of ingredients was a major factor in brewing.  Making a really hoppy beer was prohibitively expensive.  Just compare an English IPA brewed from old recipes vs. an American IPA.   &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Yeast and Microbiology&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;This is where modern technology really helps out.  Louis Pasteur discovered yeast in 1857. Up until that time, the changing of sugar into alcohol was considered magic or an act of god.  It was understood that the foam on top of a fermenting wort could be passed around to other vats of wort to start the process (&lt;a href="http://www.homebrewersassociation.org/how-to-brew/exploring-the-german-technique-of-krausening/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Krausening&lt;/a&gt;). Others would transfer &lt;a href="http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000103.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Magic Sticks&lt;/a&gt; from batch to batch to start fermentation.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;There are other microorganisms that can inhabit beer. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brettanomyces_bruxellensis" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Brettanomyces&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediococcus" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Pediococcus&lt;/a&gt; to name a few.  These can cause a sour, acidic flavor in beer.  Some ancient breweries would just let the cold night air in through an open window in order to cool the freshly boiled wort, exposing the warm sugar solution to whatever might land on it.  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Technology&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Thermometers - The temperature of the mash can affect the fermentabilty of the wort. The temperature of the malting and drying affect the sugar content of malted barley.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Chemical cleaners - All of the brewing equipment is sanitary. Modern living through chemistry.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Food storage/availability - I can get whatever ingredients I want, whenever I need them.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Refrigeration - I can cool the wort in controlled conditions. Beer can travel farther. I can ferment at optimal yeast temperature.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;More than can possibly be named...&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;h1&gt;The Result?&lt;/h1&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Ancient beers would be sweeter and thicker than today's thanks to less fermentable sugars in the wort due to inconsistencies in the brewing process, and inconsistencies in the malting process and poor yeast/microorganism control.  The alcohol content would be lower as well.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Ancient beers would not be hoppy.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Ancient beers would have to be drunk quickly before they spoiled.  The other bugs in the beer would turn the beer bad after a few weeks.  This also prevented the beer from traveling very from from the brewery.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Ancient beers could vary greatly, batch to batch.  The brewers of the times were very skilled with what they could work with, but they were constrained by what ingredients they could use, whether by law or availability.  Flavor can be affected by fermentation temperature, so a hot day in December could ruin my beer.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Ancient beers were dependent on the season. When was the grain harvested? When is it cool enough to ferment?&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Probably more information than you need, but hopefully it helps.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"Green" refers to the flavor of the beer. Under-matured beer can have a green apple aroma called Acetaldehyde. IT is reduced by yeast in the maturation phase. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The short answer is No.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ian Horney in "A History of Beer and Brewing" makes this claim[0].  But it is not backed up by evidence.  Henry VIII's beer brewer John Pope was given special dispensation to hire more than four foreign workers for the household brewery[1].  So at least Henry VIII's court brewed their own beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The various laws are being used to differentiate between Ale and Beer.  Ale being made with a selection of herbs known as a "gruit" - that must not contain hops.  Whereas beer was flavoured with hops (and possibly other herbs).  The generic use of hops was never banned[2], but the use of hops &lt;em&gt;in ale&lt;/em&gt; was controlled.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When you joined the army the final part of recruitment was to be paid a shilling.  When the recruiters came to a village they would go to the local bar to try to persuade young men to join.  One way to do this was to put a shilling in the tankard.  I'm not sure if that is the reason for glass bottom tankards though, anyone rich enough to own one would probably be to old to fight.  Another story is the glass bottom was so you could see a punch coming when you had the tankard raised.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally I think it is just so you can see if the beer is cloudy.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The origins of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_shilling" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;King's Shilling&lt;/a&gt; seems to have appeared about the time of the &lt;a href="http://www.warof1812.ca/recruit.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;War of 1812&lt;/a&gt;, because of the need for recruitment was so necessary due to the fact that the English were already at war with France.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Recruiting parties scoured the countryside and city streets for able-bodied soldiers. In his arsenal of weapons, the recruiting Sergeant offered any perspective recruit a bounty of over two month’s worth of wages to enlist. Some were offered the option to enlist for limited time of service, usually a 7-year term, and receive a smaller bounty, but most chose the other option: service for life. Calculating one’s options in life must have been difficult for the recruit in a noisy, smoke-filled Ale House after consuming a number of gills of rum, happily provided by a member of the recruiting party. While the recruiting prospect drank endless rounds from the punch bowl, his ears were filled with stories of an easy life as a soldier, quick promotion and how women to could not help but be drawn to a man in a red coat. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The members of a recruiting party were all quite motivated in convincing say a young weaver or labourer to join as each was paid handsomely for each recruit they brought before the army surgeon for inspection and got attested by a Justice of the Peace. If the potential recruit hesitated to enlisted, deception was applied. A recruiting sergeant recounted:&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;…your last recourse was to get him drunk, and then slip a shilling in his pocket, get him home to your billet, and next morning swear he enlisted, bring all your party to prove it, get him persuaded to pass the doctor. Should he pass, you must try every means in your power to get him to drink, blow him up with a fine story, get him inveigled to the magistrates, in some shape or other, and get him attested; but by no means let him out of your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Why the expression &lt;a href="http://www.royalscotsgrenadiers.com/kingsshilling.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;To Take The King's Shilling:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The expression 'to take the king's shilling', meant to sign up to join the army. Rather like with the 'prest' money for the 'impressed' man, a bonus payment of a shilling was offered to tempt lowly paid workers to leave their trade (an average daily wage during the Napoleonic period was 2p (at 12p to a shilling, this represented six days wages in one go). Once the shilling had been accepted, it was almost impossible to leave the army.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Since the army was not seen as an attractive career, recruiting sergeants often had to use less than honest methods to secure their 'prey', such as getting the recruitee drunk, slipping the shilling into his pocket and then hauling him before the magistrate the following morning (still hungover) to get him to accept the fact that he was now in the army. Sometimes the 'King's shilling' was hidden in the bottom of a pewter tankard (having drunk his pint, the unfortunate drinker found that he had unwittingly accepted the King's offer). As a result, some tankards were made with glass bottoms. Other recruits came from the courts, where a criminal's sentence could be commuted to service in the army - still the case (apparently) with the Blackwatch Regiment.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;In fact the bounty for joining the army was much larger than a shilling. New recruits received £23.17s.6d, but out of this they were obliged to buy their uniform - a not inconsiderable expence.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is a picture of the &lt;a href="https://shop.nmrn.org.uk/products/kings-shilling-tankard" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;King's Shilling Tankard&lt;/a&gt; in question:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of different factors that provide the alcohols percentage,&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;It's not really the liquid burning. It's the vapors that catch fire.
					  Higher proof equals more vapor, depending on temperature. &lt;a href="http://gizmodo.com/5935493/five-scientifically-surprising-facts-about-booze" rel="nofollow"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So burning alcohol is not a guaranteed way of finding out the percentage as whilst cooking wine will 'flame on' despite being low percentage and this is all to do with the vapor of the alcohol. Sure a High proof alcohol will catch fire easier but that will only tell you that it is a high proof alcohol not the percentage in it. A low proof vodka can ignite if a flame is held to it as the change in temperature will make it produce more vapor and it will ignite&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;(Please don't try and set fire to alcohol if you don't need to it can course spillage that will then cause an out of control fire and we don't want any of you guys to start burning up on us now )&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You don't define "burn" and I don't find a reference.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Is burn distill or literally burn.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Fire requires heat, oxygen, and fuel.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Flash point is the temp it will burn with an external ignition source. The flash point is a function of temp. Not much effected by humidity.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;The flash points of ethanol wt % concentrations[102]
					wt %    Temperature
					10%     49 °C (120 °F)
					20%     36 °C (97 °F)
					30%     29 °C (84 °F)
					40%     26 °C (79 °F)
					50%     24 °C (75 °F)
					60%     22 °C (72 °F)
					70%     21 °C (70 °F)
					80%     20 °C (68 °F)
					90%     17 °C (63 °F)
					96%     17 °C (63 °F)
					&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Even at the flash point it will not generate enough heat to continue burning once the external ignition source is removed.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Burn off would be hard to gauge and I don't think any alcohol (for human consumption) would burn 1/2 off at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Give 1/2 is the threshold it is more like they just boiled the alcohol off in a pot. The boiling point of alcohol is 173 F. Just stop when the temp get to 173F. 50% would be 100 proof. Yes some water boils off even at 173 and some alcohol is left behind. But it is about a wash.  I would say the margin of error would be like 5%. If you did a true batch distillation would be within 1%.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In Germany there is a famous comic book beer called &lt;strong&gt;Bölkstoff&lt;/strong&gt;.
					They also began producing it but nowadays it's rare, but you can get it online.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100912/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;films&lt;/a&gt; about Werner where he drinks this specific beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Rötger Feldmann is the author of these comic books and films. You can find info &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B6tger_Feldmann" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B6tger_Feldmann" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; much more on the German wikipedia page. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When I tended bar, I had several regulars who would drink club soda with a couple splashes of bitters to calm an upset stomach.  But it never did anything for me personally.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I don't know if it's purely a psychological effect or a your-mileage-may-vary situation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have episodes of heartburn, usually from eating beef or potatoes and I find it very soothing to drink a splash of bitters in club soda.  I make homemade bitters with ginger, grapefruit, gentian root, and several spices that seem to be the most effective. Bitter herbal liqueurs are popular in Europe for before or after a meal to stimulate the appetite or aid digestion.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Gentian root is one of the most common bitter agents. While I don't know of any clinical studies, gentian root has been used in herbal medicine for centuries to treat digestive issues. It makes sense from an evolutionary perspective because bitter compounds are mostly found in plants and are often more or less poisonous. If the body produces more digestive enzymes in response to bitter flavors, the extra enzymes can neutralize the poison or extract more nutrition from the plant material. It's certainly not totally effective, salivary enzymes won't save you from hemlock poisoning, but it could reduce the ill effects of mild poisons. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Angostura bitters and club soda is a regular drink in my house. I find that it calms my stomach and just generally makes me feel better. I like to use a heavy dose of bitters--usually like 8-10 dashes--per 8 oz of soda.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Fernet is also a real godsend for digestive ailments, but be warned that it's very, very bitter. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When I have a nasty cough or a cold I drink Jägermeister to soothe the sore throat and to keep me from coughing every five seconds. I find it cools my throat and makes it less itchy. This works really well for me, a lot better than actual cough medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Commonly known amongst bartenders, a remedy for curing the hiccups is to eat a &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/31/style/a-bitter-medicine-cures-the-hiccups.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;lemon wedge doused with bitters&lt;/a&gt;. (In case anyone is wondering... don't eat the rind. Bleh.) Traditionally Angostura bitters are used, although it's possible that Angostura's use is due to availability, for a long time it was the only type of bitters most bars carried. A caveat though, the lemon trick is only recognized for curing hiccups induced by drinking alcohol. I say it's still worth a try, no matter the cause of the hiccups. If the flavor sounds unappealing you can put granulated sugar on the lemon in addition to the bitters. Sugar has a hidden benefit too, it's a known hiccup remedy when taken by itself... and not just the ethanol induced ones.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In short, it's because of taxation. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=wkUlAQAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA74633#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Commonwealth of Australia's Parliamentary Debates of 1904&lt;/a&gt; (p.8534),  The Honourable Chris Watson (who went on to become the 3rd Prime Minister) made a statement about the brewers of Sydney strongly objecting to a proposal for an excise duty on beer. The sentiment amongst Sydney's brewers was that the additional cost would be difficult to pass on to the consumer, and in fact they had thus far failed to do so. In response The Honourable Alexander Poynton, said that the tax had successfully been passed from brewers to consumers in South Australia by making the glasses smaller.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For the record, The Honourable Chris Watson expressed sadness at the notion of smaller glasses.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The answer is no; drinking traditionally prepared absinthe causes no more brain-damge or insanity than any other alcoholic beverage...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;...absinthe languished in exile for nearly a century, a casualty of bad publicity, special-interest lobbies and mythology. That allowed absinthe to become something of an urban legend, something to talk about in whispers, with wide eyes. Much is said about absinthe; very little of that is true.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;So let’s clear up a few misconceptions. Absinthe does not make you hallucinate. It is not wildly addictive. It will not cause you to lop off your ear, unless (possibly, on the off-chance) you are a deeply disturbed painter racked by poverty, heartbreak and mental illness. Rather, absinthe is a good drink.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Degas’ famous 1876 painting, L’Absinthe, is a portrait of overindulgence and isolation: a woman slumped over her cafe table in front of an absinthe glass, face gone slack. In 1890, the book “Wormwood: A Drama of Paris” vilified absinthe, portraying the downward spiral that inevitably follows a drink. (Think “Reefer Madness” for fin-de-siècle Paris.) In 1905, a disturbed Swiss man, drunk on absinthe, murdered his entire family. Absinthe didn’t make him do it — any more than a bipolar who hacks up his neighbor after drinking Jamesons has been deranged by Irish whiskey.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Environmental chemist T.A. Breaux, who has studied absinthe for 14 years, explains what led to the drink’s decline. “As absinthe became immensely popular, there was a drive to make it cheaper,” he says. “In urban areas, where they didn’t have a lot of space for distillation equipment, people made absinthes from cheap industrial alcohol, using chemicals that would induce the green color. There were people who had an interest in capitalizing on this, and they failed to make a distinction between these cheaper drinks and real absinthe. It’s a little bit like using Mad Dog as a reason to ban Bordeaux.” &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/2007/12/21/absinthe/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;http://www.salon.com/2007/12/21/absinthe/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/A_FQ_glhMxw" rel="noreferrer"&gt;https://youtu.be/A_FQ_glhMxw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;According to the wiki that you linked:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The earliest reference to Epiphany as a Christian feast was in A.D. 361, by Ammianus Marcellinus.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, it would be pertinent to drink wines made from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_wine#Italian_grape_varieties" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Italian grapes&lt;/a&gt; since the feast was held within the time of the Roman Empire.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;More particularly, you might pick a grape variety from &lt;a href="http://www.unrv.com/economy/wine-chart.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;a list of ancient grapes&lt;/a&gt; from which the Romans, themselves, would have made wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not that it's entirely pertinent to the Feast of Epiphany, but it is apt to say here that, you might purchase your wine here: &lt;a href="https://www.epiphanywineco.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.epiphanywineco.com/&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as my quick and limited research has gone, there really isn't an 'official' wine of the feast - not really a Christian concept to have "official alcoholic beverages," imho.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as local traditions, the wiki you linked covers the traditions of the feast internationally but again, alcohol consumption doesn't really ever seem to be the focus...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, let's not forget that the Roman's would have had beer at this feast...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;No, that's may be true if you prepare absinthe the wrong way, because it has Tujone. Absinthe may be dangerous if badly prepared, however today's laws are really strict (in UE at least) and you won't find "home-made" (that may be dangerous) absinthe sold anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally I drink it sometimes with friends and we have never had problems (except, you know, we got a little bit drunk..)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Please note that it is not raccomanded to drink it if you are not used to alcohol because it generally have 60% to 80% vol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Drink-Absinthe" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; for some information.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This book "Reise Um Die Erde Durch Nord-Asien und Die Beiden Oceane ..., Part 1, Volume 3 By Adolph Erman", available on &lt;a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BxK__IQzdSgC&amp;amp;pg=PA267&amp;amp;lpg=PA267&amp;amp;dq=Heracleum%20dulce&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=8ayyyG3yir&amp;amp;sig=tFhtrZSWZDITQxCQ5INs6pE_Yec&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGz5KhwbjRAhUF5xoKHfrhAiI4FBDoAQgrMAQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;googleBooks&lt;/a&gt;, which describes a trip to Russia in 1828-30 quotes yet another text "Vergl. Opisanie semli Kamtschatiki Tsch II Str. 199" which in turn has a more detailed description of the Kamchatskan Cossacks making a preparation of H stems with some kind of honeysuckle berries (lonicera cerulea) and warm water, and eventually distilling a spirit from it with possible hallucinogenic properties.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The text is in German, my own German is a little rusty, and the text cannot be copied to put into google translate.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The other text quoted is probably this &lt;a href="http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/exhibition-reading-europe/detail.html?id=99047" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;A Description of Kamchatka Semi-island. V.2, published 1755&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So I think your sources are quoting much older sources for this. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I found another source (1779), &lt;a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=1&amp;amp;itemID=A758.03&amp;amp;viewtype=text" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Captain Cook's account of his own travels in Kamchatka&lt;/a&gt; also speaks of this plant (page 337), and has another explanation of why it was used for making spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I can't find anything recent to suggest that the practice is still current, but who knows ?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As noted in &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/a/4626/5064"&gt;Xander's ♦ answer&lt;/a&gt;, it is a cultural reason as to why both France and Italy have such a lower beer consumption than their neighbors?
					The answer would be all too simple to say it is because they can. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not only is it a cultural thing, it may have an historical cultural reason. The top wine producing countries are Italy, France followed by Spain. The reason why Spain produces less wine and beer may be due to its' drier climate.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Spain produces about 5 billion bottles of wine annually and is actually home to the largest number of vineyards of any European country. However, its vineyards are more spread out and produce smaller yields than vineyards in France or Italy due to the drier soil common in many wine-growing regions of Spain. Although more than 400 varieties of grapes are grown in Spain, just 20 of those account for nearly 90% of all Spanish wine production. - &lt;a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/090915/4-countries-produce-most-wine.asp" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The 4 Countries that Produce the Most Wine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Why Italy and France produces less beer and yet more wine may be due to the influence of its' Catholic heritage. Both France and Italy have strong roots with Catholicism and the Holy See. Italy was once the home of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_States" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Papal States&lt;/a&gt; (8th century - 1870) and France was home the papacy during the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Schism" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Western Schism&lt;/a&gt;. We must keep in mind that for Catholics &lt;strong&gt;wine is absolutely necessary for their liturgy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In fact the Vatican is at the top of the list of wine drinking nations.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Vatican City is at the very top of the wine-drinking league with an average resident consuming an impressive 54.26 liters a year. Although it may seem surprising that the Holy See grabs top spot, it does have a uniform and unusual demographic. Its residents are older and tend to eat together in large groups while the &lt;strong&gt;consumption of Communion wine is standard practice for a large proportion of them.&lt;/strong&gt; Andorra, another small European nation, is in second place with 46.26 liters consumed per capita. France places fifth, with residents drinking 42.5 liters of wine each year.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Prohibition was an Era in American history from 1920-1933 - and - it failed miserably. If anything, it made alcohol more popular.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Prohibition, in general, also means to prohibit something via law or religion though. The religious aspect is the only case that one can see prohibition working. ::Insert Mormonism/Islamic religion/et cetera here::&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sorry, the top answer here is kind on the right track but not 100%. It all has to do with the CLIMATE of these countries. Generally, in the northern hemisphere, you cannot make quality wine above the 50th parallel. It simply starts to get too cold to grow grapes that get ripe enough for wine. OTOH, you can grow barley just about anywhere. So, why did they choose wine over beer then? The other reason why wine is the preferred drink &lt;em&gt;where you can grow grapes&lt;/em&gt; is that beer goes bad quickly and does not transport easily. Whereas, wine can be stored a long time and transported long distances (we are of course talking about ancient history). So, given a choice, our ancestors usually choose wine.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is a map to show where grapes can be grown and it explains why historically it was grown where it was.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Oh... something I am a real expert at! You are mixing your context when calling vines hybrids. There are three ways you can grow grapes for fruit. 100% original "own rooted" vines, grafted vines and hybridized vines. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Let's back up so I can explain why that is. Many Americans in the 1600-1800s tried unsuccessfully to bring European vines to North America and they always died within a few years and they could never figure out. When American vines were brought to France in the 1860s to study the differences between American and European vines, they inadvertently brought a root louse called phylloxera with them in the soil (they also brought over powdery mildew, but that's another story). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As it came to be, phylloxera completely wiped out most vineyards in Europe within a decade or so. Then started a race to figure out a "cure" for this bug. Three methods were attempted. The first was to drown the soil in chemicals to kill the bugs and that worked for a long time. Some vineyards were still operating like that until the 1960s. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;After more research, they figured out that American vines were resistant to phylloxera. So that led to the other two ways of keeping their vines alive. Hybridization between French and American vines. These hybrids were resistant and yet made drinkable wine. Not the same quality as 100% vitis vinifera but hey it got you tipsy just like a good Cabernet did. Many of these hybrids are still around. I have grown several of them. One that I liked a lot is called Leon Millot. The French after WWII, in a fit of purity, have banned most of these grapes and had them ripped out.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The third way was considered the best way to preserve the flavors of the cabernets and chardonnays of the world. They took a page from the apple growing industry, which had already perfected the art of grafting roots onto a different tree. So, they grafted American vines onto French (and German and Italian and so on) vines. This worked out almost perfectly for everyone. In fact, because they use several different vitis species (there is only one vitis species in Europe, vitis vinifera) they were able to more tightly control how the vines grow. This saved the wine industry around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are only several small pockets and one large one, where phylloxera hasn't invaded. The big one is Washington State in the Northwest corner of the United States. This is where I live. Because of the unique soils (very sandy) and climate (basically a desert) they can grow "own rooted" vines. So, if you are in a place where you can buy a Washington State wine, you are tasting the last place on earth where European vines are grown on their own roots.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Can you taste a difference? I would say not really. There are so many factors that come into play when making a wine. Any subtle influences the own rooted vs. rootstock play in flavor is masked by things like oak, climate, yeast and so on. Just be happy there is a place in the world that phylloxera has not invaded! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There were two types of drinks back in that time. Beer and Wine. Both hardly resembled what they are today. Beer was very weak, under 4% alcohol, while wine was probably in the normal range of 12-14%. Distilling had not been invented by the Muslims until 700 A.D. (anno Domini). If I apply Occam's Razor here, I would say that it's wine and probably a higher end wine because the more expensive wines were more alcoholic. As I mentioned in my other answer, you want to get your hands on some Retsina or that other Israeli wine being made in an ancient manner.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm adding the Wikipedia page on there about this exact passage.. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_in_the_Bible" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Alcohol in the Bible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"strong drink"; "denotes any inebriating drink with about 7–10 percent alcoholic content, not hard liquor, because there is no evidence of distilled liquor in ancient times.... It was made from either fruit and/or barley beer"; the term can include wine, but generally it is used in combination with it ("wine and strong drink") to encompass all varieties of intoxicants&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Surely mead, honey wine, should be considered. Okay, I had to google this one: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Wiki says&lt;/a&gt; that residual evidence has been found in northern Chinese pottery vessels dating from 6500–7000 BC, and in Europe in the ceramics of the Bell Beaker Culture (c. 2800–1800 BC). Wiki goes on to tell us that, contemporaneous to John the Baptist, Greeks and Romans were imbibing it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;The Quotation&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I shall examine the passage in the original Greek:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;ἔσται γὰρ μέγας ἐνώπιον τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ οἶνον καὶ σίκερα οὐ μὴ πίῃ, καὶ Πνεύματος Ἁγίου πλησθήσεται ἔτι ἐκ κοιλίας μητρὸς αὐτοῦ.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The two words we are intereted in here are 'οἶνον' ('wine'), and 'σίκερα' ('strong drink'). The second ('σίκερα') is interested in that it is a loan word directly from the Hebrew word 'שכר' (transliterated 'shekar'). This word is rather popular in the Old Testamant (appearing 7941 times), so it is little surprise that 'σίκερα' appears 4608 times in the New Testament. The two (in both languages) are usually used in conjunction with each other, to form the phrase 'wine and strong drink' to encompass the whole variety of intoxicants. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_in_the_Bible#Hebrew" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;The Wine&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wine was the ubiquitous alcoholic beverage of the ancient world. The process by which the ancient peoples made wine was simple. First, they pressed grapes into grape juice, then left the juice in large earthenware jars to ferment. Fermentation took two weeks to a month. Distillation had not yet been discovered, so Roman wine was of about the same strength as modern wine (around 13%), or possibly a bit stronger. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While 'true' Romans diluted their wine with water (roughly one part wine to two parts water), making it a beverage that could be drunk all day long, without danger of drunkenness, people living in provinces, such as Judea, are not supposed to have done so. That said, it is likely that the Roman officials did dilute their wine, in keeping with the custom back in Rome. Because of this, it is also likely that citizens wishing to curry their favour might also have adopted this custom. The Greeks also diluted their wine (roughly one part wine to four parts water). &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_alcoholic_drinks#Rome" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Other Alcohols&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Other alcohols included beer, which became significantly less popular than wine. In particular, wealthy Romans looked down on the drinking of beer. Tacitus (writing much later, in the 1st Century AD) wrote disparagingly of German beer. Barley wine (a type of strong ale, roughly 6-11%) existed, as well as alcohols made from whatever fruits might be growing in the vicinity. For example, when Caesar arrived in Britain in 55BC, he found the locals drinking an apple cider, a custom he and his men adopted with enthusiasm. &lt;a href="http://drinkfocus.com/beer/history-of-apple-cider/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have not be able to find any evidence for the consumption of distilled spirits or liqueurs.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Abstention&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Abstaining from alcohol was not as easy then as it might be now. Since a large proportion of running water was (and still is) undrinkable, ancient peoples turned to alcohol (in particular wine) as a daily staple, giving them the fluid they needed. The water mixed with wine would be (somewhat) sterilised, allowing it to be drunk, and making the wine go further. One assumes that John must have drunk water only, or at least non-alcoholic juices (grape, etc.). There is reference in the bible to non-alcoholic wines, although this is rare.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Shandies or Biermischgetränke (German for beer mixed drinks) are almost as old as beer itself. Recently I visited one of the oldest breweries in Czech Republic and they did tell stories of how their beers mixed well with juices as early as 18th century. Although documentation standing to the rigours of science is not available to my knowledge.
					Actually Shandies have a very good reputation amongst the regulars, especially women as everyone cannot palate the bitterness of beers. Shandies are known to keep the soul of beer without the bitterness of their character. 
					The 'bad reputation' is with critics who look for remnant taste of beer; which is very unfair to the Shandy because it is after all a distinct personality, not an adjunct to beer. It is a cocktail; not a beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Check out this great article: &lt;a href="http://www.ranker.com/list/crazy-ways-people-hid-alcohol-during-probihition/kellen-perry" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;10 Ingenious Ways Booze Was Hidden During Prohibition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The old "alcohol-in-the-cane" trick ;)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here are four examples from the list:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H3hRf.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H3hRf.jpg" alt="The Hollow Cane Trick"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hollow Cane Trick&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The Library of Congress &lt;a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/npcc.05760/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;labels&lt;/a&gt; this one "Woman seated at a soda fountain table is pouring alcohol into a cup from a cane, during Prohibition; with a large Coca-Cola advertisement on the wall, 2/13/22."&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;So-called "flask canes" or "tippling sticks" are still a thing, even in the booze-soaked wonderland of 21st century America. One site even targets veterans by putting seals from the various branches of the US military on top of the cane. War is hell, after all, so who are we to judge? &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sD4or.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sD4or.jpg" alt="The Booze Mule Trick"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Booze Mule Trick&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;From the Walter P. Reuther Library at Wayne State University, this circa-1920s photo depicts a man showing off his trick for transporting booze throughout Detroit. He reportedly only showed this to the press, for obvious reasons, and remained anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;A shocking 75% of all the alcohol smuggled into the US during Prohibition crossed the border at the so-called "Windsor-Detroit Funnel," the nickname for waterways between Michigan and Ontario. By 1929, the second largest industry in Detroit, believe it or not, was "rumrunning," which netted $215 million per year.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/osetF.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/osetF.jpg" alt="The Bootlegger&amp;#39;s Life Preserver Trick"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bootlegger's Life Preserver Trick&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Jennie MacGregor was arrested by federal agents in Minneapolis on April 10, 1924 for this audacious get-up that dispensed "wet goods." It was known, according to a note on the back of the original photograph, as a "bootlegger's life preserver." The New York Times purchased the photo 10 days later and published it in their weekly Mid-Week Pictorial under the caption "A Perfect 36."&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;(David Dunlap of the Times' "The Lively Morgue" blog guesses this was a reference to "Tennessee, the 36th state to ratify the 19th Amendment, granting women’s suffrage?").&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ILUrr.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ILUrr.jpg" alt="The Thigh Flask Trick"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Thigh Flask Trick&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"Flask" might not be quite the right word for these behemoths. The original 1928 caption called them "tins" concealed by a "floppy overcoat." No word on how exactly these were held in place, but it they were full, they must have given this young flapper quite the workout.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The question is very broad - A lot of the answer would depend on a more specific geographical location and/or a narrower time-window.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For example in France, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavern" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Taverns&lt;/a&gt; and inns (not restaurants) were the only places for common people to eat-out all of the way up until the late 18th century, according to the wiki. This would seem to make them THE hot-spot in that region throughout that time...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's certainly popular in medieval arts to make an omage to taverns and inns in creative works:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;1.) &lt;a href="http://www.larsdatter.com/taverns.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Paintings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;2.) Many poems of the time: &lt;a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Archpoet" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Archpoet&lt;/a&gt; wishes to die in a tavern in his "Confession". See also: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trouble_at_a_Tavern" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Trafferth mewn Tafarn&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://archive.org/stream/dafyddapgwilympo00dafyuoft/dafyddapgwilympo00dafyuoft_djvu.txt" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Dafydd ap Gwilym&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;3.) There are likely more &lt;a href="http://www.medievalists.net/2014/11/medieval-drinking-song/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;drinking songs&lt;/a&gt; from the Middle Ages than one could ever hope to discover and research in a lifetime...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Given the popularity of alcohol in general, all of this would suggest that drinking establishments have been happening places before, during, and after the Middle Ages... Prob in Europe, and everywhere else... ;P&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I don't know for certain but movies set in that time period and region seem to indicate mead was fairly popular and its ABV could be more than 20% according to wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Stronger beverages like Absinthe, Gin and Vodka do not seem to have been invented by then.&lt;/p&gt;

We know that that Greek Alchemists developed the distillation processes about 1 AD and that a true distillation process was developed in Italy in the 1200s at the School of Salerno and Fractional Distillation was developed in the 1300s in Italy again. (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distilled_beverage" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Distilled Beverages Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;) In 1313 there is evidence that &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/origin-of-brandy/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Brandy&lt;/a&gt; had been made, although not widespread. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Then it seems in the 1400s, the doors open wide across Europe for distilled spirits.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Claims upon the origin of specific beverages are controversial, often
					  invoking national pride, but they are plausible after the 12th century
					  AD, when Irish whiskey and German brandy became available. These
					  spirits would have had a much lower alcohol content (about 40% ABV)
					  than the alchemists' pure distillations, and they were likely first
					  thought of as medicinal elixirs. Consumption of distilled beverages
					  rose dramatically in Europe in and after the mid-14th century, when
					  distilled liquors were commonly used as remedies for the Black Death.
					  Around 1400, methods to distill spirits from wheat, barley, and rye
					  beers, a cheaper option than grapes, were discovered. Thus began the
					  "national" drinks of Europe: jenever (Belgium and the Netherlands),
					  gin (England), Schnaps (Germany), grappa (Italy), borovička
					  (Slovakia), horilka (Ukraine), akvavit/snaps (Scandinavia), vodka
					  (Poland and Russia), ouzo (Greece), rakia (the Balkans), and poitín
					  (Ireland). The actual names emerged only in the 16th century, but the
					  drinks were well known prior to then. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, from about 500AD to 1300 AD, it was possible you could find distilled spirits, they were not widely available. Then in the 1300s distilled spirits spread across Europe and became widely available by the 1500s. Which one was actually the strongest? We'll never know but 90+% ABV was probably achievable with 1500s technology. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From 'Indians of North America' by Harold Driver.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The distribution of alcoholic beverages falls almost wholly within the bounds of horticulture. However, there was a sizeable area in Northeast Mexico which was without agriculture and where wine was made from wild plants. For the world as a whole, there is a definite correlation between alcoholic beverages and agriculture, although negative instances can also be found in the Old World. The explanation is a simple one--the liquors were made principally from domesticated plants. It is commonly assumed either that knowledge of the fermenting of these plants spread with the plants or that the making of the liquor from the plant could spread only as far as the plant was known.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;e.g. Agave and Dasylirion -- Two distinct plants were widely used in the Southwest, Meso-America, and Northeast Mexico for the production of alcoholic beverages. They were even more widely used as food. It has been conjectured that before the time when agriculture was common, say, in the second or third millennium BC these plants were a staple food or even the staple food of a large part of the region. In the Southwest, the wine was usually made from the cooked juice of the agave, not from the fresh juice as in Meso-America.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So from this I'm going to infer that technologically most native tribes who knew of fermentation would have been restricted to that form of alcohol production, and so wine would be the only form of alcohol available pre-European contact. It's also safe to say that wine production only occurred within cultures that had ferment-able produce available to them.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Prior to 1492 Native Americans actually brewed various alcoholic drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Prior to contact with colonists, alcohol use and production was mainly concentrated in the southwestern United States. Some tribes produced weak beers, wine and other fermented beverages, but they had low alcohol concentrations (8%-14%) and were to be used only for ceremonial purposes. The distillation technique required to make stronger, potent forms of alcohol were unknown. It was well documented that Mexican Native Americans prepared over forty different alcoholic beverages from a variety of plant substances, such as honey, palm sap, wild plum, and pineapple. In the Southwestern U.S., the Papago, Piman, Apache and Maricopa all used the saguaro cactus to produce a wine, sometimes called haren a pitahaya. The Coahuiltecan in Texas combined mountain laurel with the Agave plant to create an alcoholic drink, and the Pueblos and Zunis were believed to have made fermented beverages from aloe, maguey, corn, prickly pear, pitahaya and even grapes. To the east, the Creek of Georgia and Cherokee of the Carolinas used berries and other fruits to make alcoholic beverages, and in the Northeast, there is some evidence that the Huron made a mild beer made from corn. In addition, despite the fact that they had little to no agriculture, both the Aleuts and Yuit of Alaska were believed to have made alcoholic drinks from fermented berries. - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_and_Native_Americans" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Alcohol and Native Americans (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Various Indian culture brewed different drinks according to what was available in the local areas.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;In Mexico, some believe Native Americans used a corn precursor to make a brewed drink; they note: “the ancestral grass of modern maize, teosinte, was well suited for making beer – but was much less so for making corn flour.” In addition, it is well established that Mexican Native Americans prepared “over forty different alcoholic beverages [from] . . . a variety of plant substances, such as honey, palm sap, wild plum, and pineapple.”&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;In the Southwestern U.S., the Papago, Piman, Apache and Maricopa all used the saguaro cactus to produce a wine, sometimes called haren a &lt;strong&gt;pitahaya&lt;/strong&gt;. Similarly, the Apache fermented corn to make &lt;strong&gt;tiswin&lt;/strong&gt; (also called tulpi and tulapai) and the yucca plant to make a different alcoholic beverage.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The Coahuiltecan in Texas combined mountain laurel with the Agave plant to create an alcoholic drink, and the Pueblos and Zunis were believed to have made fermented beverages from aloe, maguey, corn, prickly pear, pitahaya and even grapes.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;To the east, the Creek of Georgia and Cherokee of the Carolinas used berries and other fruits to make alcoholic beverages, and in the Northeast, “there is some evidence that the Huron made a mild beer made from corn.” In addition, despite the fact that they had little to no agriculture, both the Aleuts and Yuit of Alaska were believed to have made alcoholic drinks from fermented berries.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;It should be noted, however, that most of these beverages were relatively weak, presumably no stronger than wine (which typically runs from 8-14% ABV). Whiskey, on the other hand, is usually 60% ABV, and grain alcohol (e.g., moonshine) is often 95% ABV. As a result, when Europeans introduced these stronger drinks, Native Americans were in for a shock. - &lt;a href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/11/native-americans-introduced-alcohol-europeans/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Native Americans Were Not Introduced to Alcohol By Europeans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Pueblo Indians actually brewed their own brand of &lt;strong&gt;corn beer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Ancient Pueblo Indians brewed their own brand of corn beer, a new study suggests, contradicting claims that the group remained dry until their first meeting with the Europeans. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Archaeologists recently found that 800-year-old potsherds belonging to the Pueblos of the American Southwest contained bits of fermented residue typical in beer production. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Before the discovery, historians thought a pocket of Pueblos in New Mexico did not have alcohol at all, despite being surrounded by other beer-making tribes, until the Spanish arrived with grapes and wine in the 16th century.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;A thousand years ago, traditional Native American farming villages were already scattered across parts of New Mexico, Arizona and northern Mexico, divided among several tribes including the Apache, Pueblo, Navajo and the Tarahumara. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Many of the tribes living in Mexico and some in Arizona are known to have produced a weak beer called tiswin, made by fermenting kernels of corn, but no evidence has ever been found that the same thing happened in New Mexico. - &lt;a href="http://www.livescience.com/4770-beer-brewed-long-native-americans.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Beer Brewed Long Ago by Native Americans&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you include Central and South America, there is a beverage that is still made today called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicha" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Chicha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;In South and Central America, chicha is a fermented or non-fermented beverage usually derived from maize.&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicha" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;[need quotation to verify] Chicha includes corn beer known as chicha de jora and non-alcoholic beverages such as chicha morada. Archaeobotanists have found evidence for chicha made from maize, the fruit of Schinus molle and Prosopis pods.&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauim" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; Chichas can also be made from quinoa, kañiwa, peanut, manioc root (also called yuca or cassava), palm fruit, potato, Oxalis tuberosa, chañar or various other fruits.&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauim" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;
					  While chicha is most commonly associated with maize, the word is used in the Andes for almost any homemade fermented drink, and many unfermented drinks.[3] Many different maize landraces, grains or fruits have been and can be used to make chicha in different regions.&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauim" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; The way in which chicha is made and defined is likely to change depending on the region[4]&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is a native Brazilian drink called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauim" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Cauim&lt;/a&gt; made from Manioc root:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Cauim preparation (like other cooking tasks) is strictly a women's job, with no involvement from the men. Manioc roots are sliced thin, boiled until tender, and allowed to cool down. Then women and girls gather around the pot; each repeatedly takes a mouthful of manioc, chews it, and puts it into a second pot (depending on the culture). Enzymes in the saliva then convert the starch into fermentable sugars. (Men firmly believe that if they were to chew the paste, the resulting beverage would not taste as good; and anyway they consider that work as inappropriate for them as spinning yarn would be for European men.) The chewed root paste is put back on the fire and stirred with a wooden spoon until completely cooked. The paste is then allowed to ferment in large earthenware pots ("half as big as a Burgundy wine barrel").&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are more, but these are probably the most well known from South America.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It would depend on the crop the region had plenty of. Corn and rye would lean towards bourbon and wheat and potatoes towards vodka but it's all shine in the end. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As with almost anything that becomes banned or illegal it causes the substance to increase in cost greatly since the acquisition of the substance requires illegal acts from manufacturing to distribution. Therefore, no prohibition does not generally work in stopping consumption but it does result in many other legal issues.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The world of Harry Potter has spawned an entire universe of beverages, both with and without alcohol, including those served at Universal Studios theme parks, and many independently-inspired creations.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Eater Miami describes &lt;a href="https://miami.eater.com/2016/5/27/11697900/harry-potter-wizarding-world-orlando-florida-butterbeer" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Everything You Need to Eat and Drink at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter&lt;/a&gt; by Olee Fowler (May 27, 2016) (emphasis added).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Alcoholic&lt;/strong&gt;: Just as the food remains true to the books and the setting, so do the drinks. The real star of the area is the famous Butterbeer and can be found roughly every 20 feet inside both parks. &lt;strong&gt;Butterbeer&lt;/strong&gt; is a butterscotch meets caramel meets cream soda flavored drink. It’s offered in regular form, frozen and even hot for the few days out of the year it drops below 70 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Almost as popular as the butterbeer is the &lt;strong&gt;Pumpkin Juice&lt;/strong&gt;, which is combination of pineapple and apple juices mixed with pumpkin spice flavoring, and tastes like fall in a cup. Diagon Alley also features the almost neon-bright &lt;strong&gt;Fishy Green Ale&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a mash up of mint and cinnamon with blueberry flavored pearls akin to boba at the bottom. Then there is the twist on lemonade called &lt;strong&gt;Tongue Tying Lemon Squash&lt;/strong&gt;, a fizzy orange concoction known as the &lt;strong&gt;Otter’s Fizzy Juice&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Peachtree Fizzing Tea&lt;/strong&gt;, an unsweetened ice tea.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcoholic&lt;/strong&gt;: But we know what you’re really thinking — what about the booze? Unlike its theme park counterpart Disney World down the street, all Universal parks allow alcohol on-site. Both Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley serve two &lt;strong&gt;proprietary beers&lt;/strong&gt;: the dark, malt-heavy porter known as &lt;strong&gt;Wizard’s Brew&lt;/strong&gt; and the lighter lager-style &lt;strong&gt;Dragon Scale beer&lt;/strong&gt;, both created by the Florida Beer Brewing Company.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Adjacent to Three Broomsticks is Hog’s Head Pub is the only bar in the two worlds, which is a bit grim and dark in keeping with the theme of the books. The highlight of the menu is the pub’s own &lt;strong&gt;Fire Whiskey&lt;/strong&gt;, which is its take on cinnamon-flavored Fireball. It also happens to pair well with the Butterbeer. No sodas can be found in Hog’s Head, but there are a few specialty drinks like &lt;strong&gt;Hog’s Tea&lt;/strong&gt;, a Long Island iced tea riff and the strongest drink on the menu, and the &lt;strong&gt;Pear Dazzle&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a mix of vodka and pear cider.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And a recipe sampling from the BuzzFeed article on &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/rachelysanders/harry-potter-and-the-night-he-wont-remember?utm_term=.ryzk5eb9Nm#.dr2Ep12qVw" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;8 Magical And Delicious Harry Potter Cocktails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unicorn Blood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					  1.5 oz silver tequila&lt;br&gt;
					  1.5 oz St. Germain (elderflower liqueur)&lt;br&gt;
					  1 oz lemon juice&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Add everything to a cocktail shaker with ice and shake (hard!) for a full 20 seconds. Strain into a coupe glass. Serves 1.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hair Of The Three-Headed Dog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					  1.5 oz tequila&lt;br&gt;
					  1/2 cup tomato juice&lt;br&gt;
					  1 tablespoon lime juice&lt;br&gt;
					  1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce&lt;br&gt;
					  1 teaspoon Tabasco&lt;br&gt;
					  1 12-oz bottle Mexican beer (like Corona or Modelo)&lt;br&gt;
					  2 tablespoons kosher salt &lt;br&gt;
					  1/2 teaspoon chili powder&lt;br&gt;
					  1 celery stalk, washed, root end trimmed (optional)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Mix tequila, tomato juice, lime juice, Worcestershire and Tabasco sauces. Mix salt and chili powder together in a small bowl or saucer. Rub the rim of a pint glass with a slice of lime and roll the outside of the glass rim in the chili salt to coat it. Fill glass halfway with ice, add tomato mixture, stir well, and top with beer. Garnish with celery if you like. Serves 1.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wolfsbane Potion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					  1.5 oz Scotch whiskey&lt;br&gt;
					  1.5 oz Fernet-Branca
					  Coca-Cola&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Combine Scott and Fernet in a shaker with ice and stir vigorously for 20 seconds, until fully chilled. Strain into a rocks glass with a large ice cube. Top with cola, to taste. Serves 1.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Phoenix Feather&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					  2 oz Lillet Blanc&lt;br&gt;
					  1.5 oz Campari&lt;br&gt;
					  1 oz fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice&lt;br&gt;
					  seltzer or club soda&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Combine Lillet, Campari, and grapefruit juice in a cocktail shaker with ice and shake, vigorously, for about 20 seconds. Strain into a Collins glass filled with ice cubes and top with seltzer. Serves 1.&lt;/p&gt;

					  2 750-ml bottles chilled rosé sparkling wine&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Spread raspberries and pomegranate seeds in the bottom of a bundt or ring cake pan. Cover fruit with a layer of ice cubes to keep it in place and pour enough boiled water over to just cover the ice (you don't need to use all the water). Freeze overnight. Mix Aperol, pomegranate juice, and gin together in a large punch bowl. When you're ready to serve the punch, add sparkling wine and stir gently. Float the ice ring on top. Serves about 20.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would imagine it would be either whiskey or wine brandy came from Brandivine (excuse spelling or similar pronunciation) meaning burnt wine also cider was probably popular due to the fact that the water quality was poor &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It depends on the region. Most produced ales at the time were barley wines and meads, all reaching anywhere from 7% to 12% ABV. (Roughly, I am not an academic in this by any means.) As for liquor, I don't think liquors came around until later.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I finally did a little digging. The Late Medieval Period is generally considered from 1300-1500. Whisky, did not become wide spread until the 1700s. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The first recorded instance of Whisky production&lt;/a&gt; was in 1494: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The Guild of Barber Surgeons.[15] The earliest Irish mention of whisky comes from the seventeenth-century Annals of Clonmacnoise, which attributes the death of a chieftain in 1405 to "taking a surfeit of aqua vitae" at Christmas.[16] In Scotland, the first evidence of whisky production comes from an entry in the Exchequer Rolls for 1494 where malt is sent "To Friar John Cor, by order of the king, to make aquavitae", enough to make about 500 bottles.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is ample evidence that liquor distilled from grapes and other fermented fruit well before the 1300's and Brandy was widespread by 1500. Neither Brandy or Whisky was drunk as much as wine or beer during this period, but just from the time line it looks like Brandy was a) easier to make since you start with wine and no cooking involved until distillation b) had a several hundred year head start on Whisky. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There were distilled beverages in Asia, but again not as widespread as Brandy in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Just based on the fact that the first mention of Whisky production isn't until 1494, only 6 years before the end of the Late Medieval Period and Brandy production is mentioned many times in &lt;a href="http://www.alexreisner.com/misc/distilled-spirits" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The History and Taxonomy of Distilled Spirits&lt;/a&gt; before 1500, &lt;strong&gt;I think we can safely assume that Brandy was the most widespread distilled beverage in this time frame&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/social-issues-migration-health/health-at-a-glance-2017_health_glance-2017-en#page74" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;OECD&lt;/a&gt; (The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development), alcohol consumption in its member countries (which includes the US) has been decreasing since [at least] 2000. Litres of pure alcohol consumed (a metric for standardizing alcohol consumption across drinks of varying alcohol content) has fallen from 9.5 litres per capita in 2000 to 9 litres in 2015 (roughly 5% decline).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The definition of alcoholism can vary since it typically includes the frequency of consumption within its own definition. The paper I cited includes stats on binge drinking (at least once a month) by gender, but does not compare data to prior years. There's been a ton of research on this topic, so a bit of googling should quickly turn up something useful. &lt;a href="http://www.camh.ca/en/research/news_and_publications/reports_and_books/Pages/default.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;CAMH&lt;/a&gt; has useful publications and so does the &lt;a href="http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/disease-prevention/alcohol-use/publications/2016/public-health-successes-and-missed-opportunities.-trends-in-alcohol-consumption-and-attributable-mortality-in-the-who-european-region,-19902014-2016" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But, if you read this, it sounds like Alcohol consumption (along with all it's problems including addiction) has increased significantly in the USA. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/10/542409957/drinking-on-the-rise-in-u-s-especially-for-women-minorities-older-adults" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;This study&lt;/a&gt; is out just last summer (2017) &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"In the '90s, however, alcohol consumption increased — the percentage

					  and disordered drinking increased by about 20 percent and 12 percent,
					  respectively."&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are several factors at play here. If we think about how grapes were maintained hundreds or thousands of years ago, it was kind of a slapdash affair. In the beginning they probably just grabbed whatever grapes they could off a vine growing up a tree. Later they just haphazardly planted grapes in a field hoping for the best and they mixed everything, Red and white grapes and IF they got a harvest they were grateful. This style of grape growing does not lend itself to high sugar grapes. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This illustration below shows some middle ages grape growing in Burgundy. It's basically a hillside planted every few inches. No trellis or anything. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bx1Qk.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bx1Qk.jpg" alt="Pruning Grapes Middle Ages France"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Several things changed that equation, especially after WW2. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;New World grape growing. Growing grapes in the new world exploded after WW2 and continues to expand rapidly to this day. Why is this a problem? It is and it isn't. You have to remember grapes like Pinot Noir, Riesling, Cabernet, Grenache were probably grapes that had been domesticated over hundreds or thousands of years to adapt to the climate the original vines were from. Cabernet is a good example. The dreary coast in Bordeaux where the weather is not especially warm. In a good year, the grapes might make a 13% ABV wine. You take Cabernet and stick it in Napa Valley where it is MUCH warmer and sunnier and voila, you have 17% ABV monster cabs. IMHO, it's mostly too hot in Napa Valley to make a balanced wine. Same with much of Australia and South America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern Viticultural practices. Also after WW2 irrigation was introduced this enabled growers to grow wine in areas that were too dry to grow grapes without it. Washington State is a good example. The Yakima valley gets around 9 inches of rain a year, but the temperatures are within a range of growing grapes, if a little too hot and sunny. Now you have a region that looks nothing like where the grapes originally came from. This also pertains to just about everything about growing grapes today. Trellis systems, fungicides, rootstocks, soil management, canopy management. Everything is done with a high precision to eke out the most of the vines, resulting in wines that are super ripe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern Tastes - As our palates seek out more and more sweet things, many of these modern wines are made with higher alcohols on purpose because many times high octane wines come with a fair amount of residual sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because we can! In the new world we don't have the baggage that they do in Europe. We are allowed to pretty much do anything to our wines as long as it's legal and food grade. So, if you grapes accidentally got a few extra days in 100+ degree weather and started to turn to raisins and they are at 29 brix. You paid good money for those grapes and you can't waste them so you dump some acidulated water into your fermenter to water them down to acceptable levels and replace some acid that was lost because your grapes are over ripe. All perfectly legal in the New World, but absolutely verbotten in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brand name grapes - Everyone wants Cabernet and Chardonnay. Sure you can grow them in the Central Valley in California where it is super hot in the summer, but what type of wine do you get? Hardly recognizable from the original areas they came from, but the consumers just want to have these brand name grapes so we plant them in places of abundant heat having to water them down in the fermenter to make acceptable wines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I remember my viticulture teacher telling me that you should plant grapes that would ripen almost at the last possible day of the season. This would result in grapes that are in harmony with the local climate. What you see in many places like California where grapes are harvested in July and August and there is still MONTHS of hot weather ahead. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;All of this leads to a situation where many of the grapes we plant in the new world are simply not in the best climate for the best wine. 99% of the time it's grapes planted in a climate that's simply too hot. That's why we water our wines down.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is the usual great stuff relating to 'Toasting'. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toast_(honor)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;From wikipedia - which is normally correct.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I then had a quick look at snopes.com, they proclaim the following to be false:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Q: Why do people clink their glasses before drinking a toast?
					  A: It used to be common for someone to try to kill an enemy by offering him a poisoned drink. To prove to a guest that a drink was safe, it became customary for a guest to pour a small amount of his drink into the glass of the host. Both men would drink it simultaneously. When a guest trusted his host, he would then just touch or clink the host’s glass with his own.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;ORIGINS:   Many explanations have been advanced to explain our custom of clinking glasses when participating in toasts. One is that early Europeans felt the sound helped to drive off evil spirits. Another holds that by clanking the glasses into one another, wine could be sloshed from glass to glass, thereby serving as a&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wine glasses&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;proof the beverages had not been poisoned. Yet another claim asserts that the “clink” served as a
					symbolic acknowledgment of trust among imbibers who did not feel the need to sample each others’ drinks to prove them unadulterated.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Each of those explanations is false. While making a racket for the purpose of scaring off evil spirits underpins other customs that carry over to this day (e.g., the tolling of church bells at weddings, and the loud shouts and noisemaking at the stroke of twelve on New Year’s Eve), the “clink” is a relatively new aspect of toasting and, as such, came along well after folks had relinquished the notion that demons both lurked in every corner of typical day-to-day existence and could be sped on their way by a bit of noise. As for sloshing wine from one glass to another, drinking vessels would need to be filled to the brim to effect that, and if they were, such practice would waste valuable potables (because some would be sure to land on the floor) and likely douse the toasters too. And while the poisoning of enemies has long been part of the ordinary mayhem of the world, the practice of touching of one’s filled glass to those of others when participating in a toast is unrelated to suspicion of the wine’s having been tampered with; such killings were not so common at any nebulous point in the past that a signal to one’s host indicating he was clear of suspicion of attempted murder needed to be enshrined in the canon of social gestures.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To get at the real reason for the clink of glass on glass, we have to first look at why and how we toast, and where the practice originated.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The custom of sealing with booze expressions of good wishes for the health of others dates back so far that its origins are now lost to us, yet in numerous cultures&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;such acts of camaraderie often involved shared drinking vessels. The clinking of individual cups or glasses as a proof of trust wouldn’t have meant much when
					everyone drank from the same bowl. Indeed, in those cultures where shared drinking containers was the norm, to produce one’s own vessel in such company was to communicate an unmistakable message of hostility and distrust; it would have been regarded as akin to bringing along a food taster to sample the repast.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;“Toasting,” our term for the pronouncement of benedictions followed by a swallowing of alcohol, is believed to have taken its name from a practice involving a shared drinking vessel. Floated in the “loving cup” passed among celebrants in Britain was a piece of (spiced) cooked bread that the host would consume along with the last few drops of liquid after the cup had made one round of the company. In modern times toasting has become a matter of imbibing from individual drinking vessels rather than from one shared flagon, so to compensate for the sense of unity lost in doing away with the sharing of the same cup we have evolved the practice of simultaneously drinking each from our own glass when a toast is made, thereby maintaining a communal connection to the kind words being spoken.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The clinking of glasses has been added to the practice of offering toasts for a few reasons, none having anything to do with poison. Prior to such augmentation, toasts pleased only four of the five senses; by adding the “clink,” a pleasant sound was made part of the experience, and wine glasses have come to be prized not only for their appearance but also for the tones they produce when struck. Yet beyond mere aural pleasure, the act of touching your glass to that of others is a way of emphasizing that you are part of the good wishes being expressed, that you are making a physical connection to the toast. The practice also serves another purpose, that of uniting the individuals taking part in the benediction into a cohesive group: as the wine glasses are brought together, so symbolically are the people holding them. On a deeper level, the wine is also being recommuned with itself — that which had been one (when it had been in its own bottle) but was separated (when it was poured into a variety of glasses) is brought back into contact with the whole of itself, if only for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Etiquette mavens say one need not clink glasses with everyone present when participating in toasts among large assemblies. Rather than reach across vast expanses of wide tables (thereby risking losing your balance and ending up in the guacamole), simply raise your glass and make eye contact with the group.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;MY OWN THOUGHTS ON THE SUBJECT&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, with all this in mind, my own thought is that in times gone by as 'rivals' drank each others health, they would drink from the other person's cup (to avoid poisoning - however all one would have to do would be to poison one's own cup - surely that would have worked?!), as the cups were held to the other person's lips they would inadvertantly 'clink' together.  As time moved on and we attempted not to kill everyone in our paths the clinking just wort of became symbolic.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I usually use either Jägdbitters (a Jägermeister-like bitters sold at Aldi) or my family's version of Bärenjäger (which I prepare at home - nope, it's not bitters, but it was also used historicaly for the same purpose), mostly when I feel a cold coming up due to catching rain.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Jägermeister gives a soothing feel to the throat if taken when you're already with the cought, but if taken as a preventive, it makes me feel like a warm blanket was dropped over my shoulders and I don't get the actual cold afterwards. It always works we me too, better than pharmacy bought stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I use gentian bitters (made from violets, such as Fee Brothers Aromatic Bitters, Peychaud's Bitters or Angostura) with soda water for stomach ailments.  It really does the trick.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You have a lot of information right out of Wikipedia when searching for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome_and_wine" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Ancient Rome + wine&lt;/a&gt;, and too much for it to be copied or gathered here. But here is some information I also learnt from History courses or readings.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Basically, many wines (Greece, France, Italy...) were kind of "sour" and people were used to adding spices (among other things), not only to "sweeten" the taste, but also to help store the wine and keep it drinkable for a longer time. &lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some of the wines the Romans used to drink (there may be more than that, of course):&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Mulsum -&gt; wine with spices and honey (served during the &lt;em&gt;gustatio&lt;/em&gt;, before the meal)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Turriculae -&gt; dry wine, with sea-water, fenugreek and &lt;em&gt;defrutum&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Carenum -&gt;  sweet and liquorous, from very mature / ripe grapes, with quince, various plants and &lt;em&gt;defrutum&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Vinum picatum -&gt; (&lt;em&gt;pitched wine&lt;/em&gt; is the closest I can come with in English) wine that was sweetened by the &lt;em&gt;pitch&lt;/em&gt; used to seal the container.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Why would they add many different plants / herbs / honey / water?&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ref. Wikipedia&lt;/strong&gt; : Romans drank their wine mixed with water, or in "mixed drinks" with flavorings. &lt;em&gt;Mulsum&lt;/em&gt; was a mulled sweet wine, and apsinthium was a wormwood-flavored forerunner of absinthe. Although wine was enjoyed regularly, and the Augustan poet Horace coined the expression "truth in wine" (in vino veritas), drunkenness was disparaged. It was a Roman stereotype that Gauls had an excessive love of wine, and drinking wine "straight" (&lt;em&gt;purum&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;merum&lt;/em&gt; = unmixed) was a mark of the "barbarian".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It seems that it was done for 3 purposes:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;keep wine longer and help it come from countries hundreds of miles and days of travel away.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;make the wine more "drinkable" and enjoyable.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;don't do like barbarians do and look like a well-educated person.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;-&gt; &lt;em&gt;How alcoholic was it?&lt;/em&gt; is a question I have no knowledge of and no answer to.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1 - FWIW: adding spices to a beverage was done again centuries later, when people started drinking hot chocolate (before the refining process / conche was discovered). The taste was so bitter / sour that people put a lot of spices and sugar in it.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2 - A reduction of must in Ancient Roman cuisine, made by boiling down grape juice or must in large kettles until reduced to half of the original volume. See also &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape_syrup" rel="noreferrer"&gt;grape syrup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt; In Gujarat , A state of India There is prohibition since 1958 which has never worked and also created lots of illegal troubles as well as loss of taxes on booze. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Bombay State had prohibition between 1948 and 1950, and again from 1958.[17] Gujarat has a sumptuary law in force that proscribes the manufacture, storage, sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages. The legislation has been in force since 1 May 1960 when Bombay State was bifurcated into the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat. The Bombay Prohibition Act, 1949 is still in force in Gujarat state, however there is licensing regime in Maharashtra with granting licenses to vendors and traders. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Gujarat is the only Indian state with a death penalty for the manufacture and sale of homemade liquor that results in fatalities. The legislation is titled the Bombay Prohibition (Gujarat Amendment) Bill, 2009.[18] The legislation was prompted by numerous deaths resulting from the consumption of methyl alcohol.[19]&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But the result is that people dies due to homemade liqueurs every month and every year. You can check this. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;in a world where people follow laws and do not attempt to profit from illegal activities, Prohibition of a product would 'in theory' work.  however, that is not the reality we live in.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Historical evidence shows us that with a vast majority of prohibition of a product, the demand for said product does not immediately drop, but the supply does.   This makes the product very profitable for those entities that are able to obtain said product and then distribute it for basically any price they so choose.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Thus for the example with alcohol prohibition in the 1920's US, crime families immediately started to acquire or make product, distribute it, and even open facilities to sell and consume.  This took out all middle men and gave them full and complete control of the entire supply chain, and thus allowed for them to keep maximum profits.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another example in the US, is how the war on drugs has done little to stop the demand for drug in the country and only made the cartels more money.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes, wine can pretty much be made from all edible fruit, &lt;a href="http://edibleroadtrip.com/blog/2014/1/2/6tjqenl9lxr9h0vyk54aob7hms68f0" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;including tomatoes&lt;/a&gt;. But the reason we make wine out of grapes is three fold. Sugar, tannins and acids. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sugar&lt;/strong&gt;. Grapes produce the highest naturally occurring amount of sugar of any fruit. Almost no other fruit comes close. Grapes have the ability to make wines that are anywhere from 10-18% alcohol and even higher in the case of late harvest grapes that have too much sugar to finish alcohol production. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acid&lt;/strong&gt;. Grapes have a very high naturally occurring acid levels coming from Tartaric acid. Acids help preserve wine and keep the nasty bugs from eating the sugar. They also make it more drinkable. Wine without any acid is flat and awful. It's like beer without hops.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tannin&lt;/strong&gt;. Red and white grapes contain tannin in both the skins and seeds. These are a natural antioxidant that help preserve the wine for long term storage. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Since grapes have such natural high sugar levels, they also have large colonies of yeast on the skin (aka the bloom) and because of this, grapes are a complete package requiring nothing else to make a high alcohol beverage that can be stored for a very long time without spoiling. No other fruit has the right combination of attributes to do this on it's own.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If they can make wine out of durian fruit, then one can make wine out of any fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most people find the taste or flavor of this fruit disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In fact durians are not allowed on the Singapore subway or on many commercial flights at all.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/78FeG.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/78FeG.jpg" alt="Sign informing that Durian fruit is not allowed inside the Singapore subway"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durian" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Sign informing that Durian fruit is not allowed inside the Singapore subway.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yet durians can be made into wine and what is great about it, is the fact that the durian wine is devoid of its' pungent smell.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;It's a formidable feat pulled off by a team of student researchers at the National University of Singapore who hope to commercialize their durian wine and see the product on store shelves.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Known as both the "King of Fruits" and the world's stinkiest fruit, the durian is likewise perhaps the most polarizing food with people who either love it hate it.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;After testing out different fermentation methods, the end result is a &lt;strong&gt;wine of 6 percent alcohol which is devoid of the fruit's pungent smell.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/eats/world-stinkiest-fruit-turned-wine-article-1.1411504" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;World's stinkiest fruit is turned into wine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the others, I'll say &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt;, at least if you're going to have some reasonable definition of the word "wine". Fruits which will produce no fermentable juices are simply not going to work. If you have to treat the fruits in such a way as to convert starches in order to get sugars to ferment, can you really call the product a "wine", even in a loose sense?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You are going to struggle mightily to produce wine from avocados or eggplants, for example... even limes are so low in sugar and high in acidity that even after neutralizing some acid you will have to add a bunch of sugar to have anything to ferment... in this case, you're really making a flavored kilju, rather than a wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And if you want to get technical about fruits, then "all fruits" is actually a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit#Simple_fruit" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;very broad category&lt;/a&gt;. Brazil nuts, &lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Acer_circinatum_26294.JPG" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;maple keys&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Carrot_seeds_in_Uzbekistan.JPG" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;carrot seeds&lt;/a&gt; are all fully-fledged fruits that are going to be very difficult or impossible to extract a fermentable juice from.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Of course, you could probably use a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_oryzae" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;koji&lt;/a&gt; to first saccharify your initial base and produce something like a sake, but despite the colloquial misnomer "rice wine", if you're going to call this a wine, then you can do it with nearly anything: why limit yourself to fruits? Then is there really a further difference with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kvass" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;kvass&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumis" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;kumis&lt;/a&gt;. Is beer now wine?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is completely discounting the whole classes of toxic fruits that you might be able to produce something technically alcoholic but definitely nondrinkable from, e.g. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atropa_belladonna" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;belladonna&lt;/a&gt; and other toxic nightshades, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actaea_pachypoda" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;baneberries&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These guys aren't claiming that it's Noah's wine, but they are saying they are using the same methods that they used 8000 years ago to make wine and you can buy it in the Republic of Georgia. &lt;a href="http://%20https://medium.com/@foodmatters/is-georgias-ancient-wine-making-method-making-a-comeback-fd54db9946dc" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Is Georgia's Ancient Wine Making Method Making a Comeback?&lt;/a&gt; You can buy it around the world supposedly. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Kvevri wines from Georgia can be found in a few stores and restaurants in New York City, San Francisco and Washington DC. Noel Brockett, who distributes both conventional and kvevri wine from Georgia in Washington DC for the Georgia Wine House, says it may take time to reach the general public but, “the Sommelier community is definitely becoming much more interested in the kvevri wines as the general market turns toward authenticity.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Other than trying something out for historical purposes, the wine probably didn't taste all that great. They probably drank it young since they didn't have bottles and it was likely very cloudy and low alcohol. Probably not red since that would require fermenting on the skins in a controlled manner. Probably like a cloudy rose' or a orangeish white. We'll never know what grapes were used by Noah.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karasì&lt;/strong&gt; is not designed to resemble that of Noah's wine, but it may have some small characteristics of the grapes Noah used.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karasì&lt;/strong&gt;, is a tribute to the 6100 year wine tradition of Armenia. Aged in traditional amphorae, hence its name, ‘from amphorae’ in Armenia, this wine embraces the living heritage of a country while at the same time it delves back into a long forgotten chapter in the ancient history of wine.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grape Variety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The King of Armenia’s grapes and possibly one of the oldest grape varieties in the world Areni has been present in Armenia for millennia. Never grafted and on its own roots, it is 100% indigenous to this land with a unique DNA proﬁle that does not match any other. Elegant and fresh, thick skinned and extremely resistant to disease, through the ages Areni has adapted perfectly to the high altitudes and extreme temperatures variations of Vayots Dzor, its natural habitat.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;With Karasì we have the pleasure of tasting both place and the exotic personality of an ancient grape most have never heard of! - &lt;a href="https://www.zorahwines.com/karasi/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Karasì&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cradle of Vine and Wine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;One of the world’s oldest civilizations, steeped in a history and tradition that dates back millennia, Armenia’s territory lies in the southern Trans Caucasus in the highlands surrounding Biblical Mount Ararat. The Cradle of Vine and Wine, the vine has forever been present in the valleys of Armenia with the wild Vitis vinifera silvestris, ancestor of the cultivated vinifera vine species, already established in its highlands over a million years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;It is also of course in Armenia, at the foothills of Biblical Mount Ararat, where legend has Noah, the world’s first vigneron, plant his vineyards and later became famously drunk on his own wine! - &lt;a href="https://www.zorahwines.com/armenia/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Armenia: The land of the beginning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Championing Native Varieties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Working uniquely with ancient native varieties the vines are planted on their own roots directly into rocky, limestone soils which have never seen Phylloxera and while ZORAH’S heirloom vineyards tell a story of times gone by, the younger vines, the cuttings of which come from ancient abandoned vineyards of a XIIIth Century monastery, show us vistas into a possible future. - &lt;a href="https://www.zorahwines.com/vineyards/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Zorah Wines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I recently watched the 2010 Maia Liddell documentary, &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1794761/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Colditz The Legend&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Colditz Castle was a maximum security prison from which no one was meant to escape... but escape they did. Take a fresh look at the legendary escapes, featuring stories from both Colditz survivors and their extended families.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Listening to the narratives by former British officers held captive and memories and anecdotes by family (sons, daughters, grandchildren) prompted Google searches, among them these.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nysun.com/obituaries/george-drew-87-british-pow-brewed-turnip-hooch/23502/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;George Drew, 87, British POW Brewed Turnip Hooch at Colditz &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Major George Drew, who has died aged 87, helped his fellow prisoners to cope with the boredom and deprivations of Colditz Castle during World War II by producing potent homemade alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;He and his friend Pat Fergusson first tried to brew from the sugar and raisins from Red Cross parcels, but failed. Then they realized that there was sufficient sugar for fermentation in the turnip jam supplied by the Germans. Mixing the jam with yeast and water, they used a piece of purloined drainpipe and a large can, sealed with plaster of Paris from the sick bay, to produce hooch for such events as St. Valentine's and St. Patrick's Days.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;However, the effects of the more than 100 proof alcohol could be severe, even leading to temporary blindness. Dental fillings would fall out. If a man was having obvious difficulty walking and talking in the castle yard it was said that he was "jam happy."&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;When Drew and Fergusson took part in the British television series "Escape From Colditz" in 2000, they made their potion for the first time since 1945. Taking the first glass before the camera, Drew said "Dear God," remarked that the smell was not quite as bad as it used to be, then drank again. "Oh Christ," he gasped.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And although not brewed, a group of tunnelers, after nine months of digging, took a wrong turn and emerged, fortuitously, in the castle’s wine cellar, enjoying 137 bottles, about four and a half bottles per person. &lt;/p&gt;
