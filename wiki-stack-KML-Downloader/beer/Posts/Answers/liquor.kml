					&lt;p&gt;While this is merely anecdotal, I agree with you that beer makes me more sleepy than liquor. My theory is that perhaps it has to do with the carbohydrates (think thanksgiving dinner). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It could definitely be a perception thing or any difference with the situation in which you consume beer vs liquor.  (IE, if you're drinking a lot of Jack and Coke maybe that caffeine is helping keep you alert?)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think the most compelling answer is that there's actually a decent amount of research that shows hop compounds actually have a slightly sedative effect, especially in conjunction with alcohol.  So...you know, beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some sources:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22849837" rel="nofollow"&gt;National Institute of Health&lt;/a&gt;: The concentration of 2 mg of hop extract effectively decreased nocturnal activity in the circadian activity rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-856-hops.aspx?activeingredientid=856&amp;amp;activeingredientname=hops" rel="nofollow"&gt;WebMD&lt;/a&gt; (Look under "Interactions"): Alcohol can cause sleepiness and drowsiness. Hops might also cause sleepiness and drowsiness. Taking large amounts of hops along with alcohol might cause too much sleepiness.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In 1821, the four Rodenbach brothers (Pedro, Alexander, Ferdinand and Constantijn) invested in a small brewery in Roeselare, in the West Flanders province of Belgium. The brothers agreed to a partnership for 15 years. At the end of this period, Pedro and his wife, Regina Wauters, bought the brewery from the others and Regina ran the business while Pedro served in the military. Their son Edward later took over the brewery (1864) and, it was during his directorship that the brewery saw great growth.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Edward's son, Eugene, took over in 1878 and, in preparation for this position, travelled to England where he learned how to ripen beer in oak barrels and then mix old and young beers. It was this that became the method of producing beer that Rodenbach became famous for. As Eugene produced no male offspring, a public limited liability corporation was created and most shares remained in the hands of descendants of the Rodenbachs until 1998 when the brewery was sold to Palm Brewery.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are 4 different types of Rodenbach beers:
					 1. Rodenbach Original (5,2% ABV) blended from aged and young ale (25%/75%);
					 2. Rodenbach Grand Cru, a rich winey beer (6% ABV) which, although blended, contains less young ale (67%/33%) (in the past this beer was unblended aged beer from a single cask selected for its qualities by a tasting panel. This type of beer has now been renamed Rodenbach Vintage beer and is available in limited quantities);
					 3. Vin de Céréale, an aged beer that is 10% ABV.
					 4. In commemoration of the brewery 150th year of activity, it produced Rodenbach Alexander (5,2% ABV). It was a variant of the Original one with a cherry taste. It is name comes from the brewery founder Alexander Rodenbach.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;After the take-over, Palm quickly stopped the production of Rodenbach's Alexander beer, a cherry-flavoured beer.&lt;a href="http://www.realbeer.com/news/articles/news-000720.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="Palm Explains Plans for Rodenbach Beers"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; When Palm Brewery bought Rodenbach, another brewery it owned already made a cherry beer. At that time Alexander Rodenbach had to be ceased for contractual non-compete sorts of reasons. However, in recent years, Palm/Rodenbach has produced and distributed, first, Rodenbach foederbier, which is served only from cask, and is unfiltered and unblended. It comes straight from an oak riping barrel and is not processed further.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think the bartender told you to drink your Rodenbach with a shot of cherry liquor, so that you can taste the original Rodenbach Alexander (the cherry-flavoured beer, Rodenbach's erstwhile cherry beer which produced before the brewery was sold to Palm). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no way to determine if a particular flavored vodka has added sugar or glycerin!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Unless one can find a particular website of a certain vodka, which states that there is no added sugar or glycerin the chances are that you will have to taste the product yourself in order to know.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The following information is from &lt;a href="http://drinkskool.com/lesson-four-white-spirits/chapter-one-vodka/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Drink Skool:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;If you’re confused, don’t be angry. Clearly the U.S. government is struggling with the issue as much as you are. Today’s science is capable of measuring imperfections in a spirit. So rather than insisting that 190 proof is an adequate minimum to guarantee quality in vodka, other metrics might have been considered in the TTB’s rule-making. For instance, some successful brands add sugar or glycerin to their vodkas to “smooth” them out. Never mind that these spirits throw any standard cocktail recipe completely out of balance. The larger question is: why do they need to add these softeners? What are they covering up? If they focused upon good raw ingredients and clean distillation they could achieve the same result. But perhaps that’s asking too much; it always comes back to economics.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Other countries are demanding that producers note upon the label any additions such as sugar or glycerin; the TTB hasn’t wised up yet. &lt;strong&gt;It will probably be a while before those additives are visible on the vodka labels, but until then, taste the stuff yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; If it tastes sweet, it probably is, and you may want to alter any cocktail recipes that you’re working from.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.absolut.com/en/products/absolut-raspberri/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Absolut Raspberri&lt;/a&gt; is just one example of a flavoured vodka that does not contain added sugar!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Absolut Raspberri is made exclusively from natural ingredients, and unlike some other flavored vodkas, it doesn’t contain any added sugar. It’s rich and intense with the fresh and fruity character of ripened raspberries.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This really just comes down to personal preference if you can haply sit and drink a stout all night, or a larger, or even cocktails it all comes down to how you handle the alcohol. It is certainly not against the norm to order a beer wine or shots. Bars cater for the many not the few, so if you want to drink beer all night drink beer all night, don't be affected with what people around you are drinking. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Even cocktail bars that I have been to still serve a variety of different drinks so don't be worried about ordering a beer &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can drink what you want, but usually there are some social rules. If you don't fancy cocktails, in a young adult type of bar (25-35 years old) wine is perfectly acceptable. If you order beer, order something better than regular beer, as import beer. And if you are not alone, shots are alright as well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Order what you like.  Drink what you like.  Life is too short to drink what someone else wants or expects you to.  If people care what you're drinking at this bar, then I question why you'd want to be there.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You should drink anything you like - but if you intend to have one drink and nurse it for an hour, there are some considerations for optimizing the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h1&gt;Ice cubes are not nice cubes&lt;/h1&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most of your typical highballs (shot of liquor topped up with a soft drink) are served "on the rocks" - with as much ice as the establishment thinks it can get away with. The longer you hold your drink, the more of the ice will melt and dilute the beverage.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The same goes for beers that will typically be consumed cool, like IPAs or lagers. Watch out for American Adjunct Lagers (Bud, Coors) in particular - you do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; want to drink those warm. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, darker beers are often served at what's called cellar temperature, so it's no big deal if you let them stand for a bit. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h1&gt;Try stronger flavours&lt;/h1&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A lager or a sweet white wine is as drinkable as juice or water, meaning that it will not last too long. Go for a red wine or strong beer - I recommend Belgian quadrupels, barleywine, stouts (especially Imperial or barrel-aged) and Imperial/Double IPAs. As an added bonus, these are not typically consumed ice-cold. For mixed drinks, lowballs (cocktails that are mostly liquor) are a good choice. Order them neat or straight (no ice) to avoid dilution. Can't go wrong with an Old Fashioned or Sazerac.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h1&gt;Variety can be nice&lt;/h1&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Drinking the same thing all night can be a little dull. If a bar has a good selection of beers, it will offer a &lt;em&gt;flight&lt;/em&gt; - 4-6 small glasses with different beers. This typically costs as much as, or slightly more than, one pint of beer. It will also help you pick a beer in the future, since you get to sample a whole bunch. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Fig liqueur completed after 4 weeks.  Here are notes:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;A lot more work than I expected it would be to strain out the liquid.
					Next time I'll use a food processor instead of making the base puree
					by hand. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;It's much darker than I expected &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The taste is nice, a little tannic on the finish. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;I've successfully used it in a Collins-type cocktail - in a rocks glass, add:

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;2 ounces fig liqueur, chilled&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;1.5 tbsp simple syrup &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;juice of 1 lime wedge &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;sparkling water to top&lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some tips:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Protect your bottles from sunlight and extreme temperatures. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;If your bottles have cork tops, make sure to keep the corks moist so that they don't disintegrate (just turning the bottles upside down every month or so for a few seconds does wonders). &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;As the level in each bottle drops, consider transferring the contents to a smaller bottle. This prevents volatiles from leaving the liquid and also excludes oxygen from the bottle (though whether you're mixing in extra oxygen during the transfer is perhaps a worry). If you know beforehand that you will take your time on a certain bottle, I'd rebottle it at the outset.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;If you already own it for wine (or are otherwise serious about keeping half-empty bottles for a long time), you could also use something like an inert gas wine preserver (e.g. PrivatE PreservE or Winesave PRO) to add a layer of what is basically Argon over the liquid. I haven't tried this.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Vermouths and other alcohols ~20% ABV don't keep well for long once opened. Treat them like wine: drink them faster or open fewer of them. They will lose their aromas, then oxidize, and finally turn to vinegar.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Liqueurs with low &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_activity" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;water activity&lt;/a&gt; (read: lots of sugar) will probably stay safe to consume for quite a long time (years), but they are still prone to oxidization leading to off flavors. Re-bottle at the outset if you must, or consume faster, or discard and buy new.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Consider storing your bitters in the fridge.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Try a few different whiskies, neat. A decent single malt can be sipped for about 30 minutes without much degradation in taste-quality. There's nothing wrong with ordering a glass of water to go with it, and in fact, it's common to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some widely available entry-level easy-to-drink single malts:
					Glenfiddich 12,
					Macallan 12,
					Highland Park 12, and
					Glenmorangie 10&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is a good question that a lot of people wonder about. Ordering whatever you like, as many of these answers say, is totally right, though I don't think that's the full story. The way that you order can help you build a relationship with your bartender (and other patrons), and that is always a good thing. An example of this is a  shot of a liqueur called Fernet Branca, a shot of Fernet for a while now has been known as the &lt;a href="https://talesofthecocktail.com/culture/praise-bartenders-handshake" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;bartenders handshake&lt;/a&gt; (don't call it that when ordering, just ask for a shot of Fernet), it's a way to tell a bartender that you respect their craft. You can get any ol' beer to wash it down. Keep in mind though that Fernet tastes pretty terrible to most people the first time they try it. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The biggest thing I would say is to try new things, get to know what's out there. This will help you learn what you like and let's bartenders really flex their skill, and they love it... at cocktail bars, not so much at dive bars, but it sounds like you have a nice spot there. If you like Gin, google some classic gin drinks and try ordering them. Order an Army Navy, a Corpse Reviver #2, or a Hemingway Daiquiri for example. Keep in mind that you won't be know the difference between the drinks that your bartenders know and the ones that are obscure, until you get to know the lay of the land so just stay humble and keep to the really familiar drinks when the bartender is crazy busy. Also, feel free when it's not busy, to use adjectives to order... "I want something sweet with whisky" or "something bitter and herbal". Keep the communication open, they know what they're doing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Just to get the ball rolling for you, here are a few to start with....
					Brandy Alexander is sweet and the perfect nightcap. An Amaretto Sour with a splash of bourbon, another easy going cocktail, it's a twist on a classic and created by one of the biggest names in the industry. A Negroni, it became super popular not long ago and has been a little bit over done since then but, you should order one and know what everyone went crazy over. Be ready, it'll be bitter.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a last note, whoever said that you should avoid girly drinks as a man is wrong, there's no such thing. I've proudly ordered a Cosmopolitan in a bar and it was delicious. Sit upright and hold your head high. If you're looking at me I'll give you something to see.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes order what you want but in Canada our biggest lottery system is called 6/49 and if you ask your bartender for a 6/49 then it becomes a way for them to showcase their skills because they will then literally serve you anything that they think you will like.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, some of the go-to drinks I tend to order at bar (excluding beers and wines) are usually rail drinks like gin &amp;amp; tonic; gin &amp;amp; gingerale; diet coke &amp;amp; tequila (trust me on this that it doesn't taste as good with either diet pepsi or non-diet coke); but when getting fancy I'll go for a mojito, a Ceasar or a SoCo Ameretto Lime (mostly due to a song by a fave band of mine when I was a kid). I keep also hearing in certain circles about the resurgence of older cocktails like the Old-Fashioned, Whiskey Sour and Tom Collins.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, the best approach would be to be upfront with your bartender, tell him you don't know what you like and are wiling to try anything they make. They might ask you palate-testing questions (like what you like to eat or not) and if you answer honestly, you'll likely end up with a great cocktail recommendation from them.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If it's busy just grab a double Gin and Tonic and sip on that for half an hour or so while the bar settles down. Once it gets quieter you can ask the bartender for a recommendation on a local IPA and try something like Mojo in the Denver airport. After that you should try something seasonal. For instance, if it's Cinco De Mayo you might want a couple tequila shots and some Coronas to follow that up. Well, at least that's what I did Friday when my flight to LA was delayed. Cheers, to whatever you choose to enjoy... responsibly of course.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The bar is an excellent place to try new drinks that you don't want to buy an entire bottle. Or to try a different brand of hard liquor!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Start with something you know and love, then you can always become more adventurous as the night goes on!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;How do Hungarians drink &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A1linka" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Palinka&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pálinka&lt;/strong&gt; should be served at 18–20 °C (64–68 °F) because it is at this temperature that the fine smell and taste of the fruit can be best enjoyed. If served too cold, the smell and the taste will be difficult to appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The form of the glass used to drink pálinka affects the drinking experience. The ideal glass is wide at the bottom and narrow at the rim, that is, tulip-shaped. The relatively narrow neck of the glass concentrates the "nose" released from the larger surface at the bottom of the glass, magnifying the smell of the drink. - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A1linka" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Pálinka (Wikipedia).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GKALk.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GKALk.jpg" alt="Pálinka  in Tulip Glasses served Sausages"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://visitbudapest.travel/budapest-events/budapest-palinka-and-sausage-festival/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Pálinka  in Tulip Glasses served Sausages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is traditionally drank in a tulip glass, straight and not mixed in one shot or sipped a little at a time. To truly appreciate Pálinka, it should &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Tips for Drinking Pálinka:&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ul&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Know your pálinka!: Kisüsti (meaning ‘a small pot’) is a double-distilled pálinka made in a copper pot. Érlelt (meaning ‘aged’) is a pálinka aged for at least three months in a wooden cask. Ó (meaning ‘old’) is aged for at least 12 or 24 months depending on the size of the cask. Ágyas (meaning ‘bedside’) is aged for at least three months together with fruit. Törköly (pomace pálinka) is made from grape pomace. It’s actually one of the oldest types of pálinka and it supposedly helps digestion.&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•It’s best to serve (and consume) at room temperature in a tulip-shaped shot glass. This temperature maintains the flavours of the fruits.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•There is no strict rule or tradition when to drink it however as Hungarian cuisine tends to be on the heavy side it’s good to have a shot (…or two) prior to a meal…and then close the meal off with another one (…or two).&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•It’s not compulsory to drink it in one go…. said no Hungarian ever! However we are lenient with foreigners so drink it slow!&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•It WILL burn your throat: don’t worry, that’s normal.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•The most popular flavours are apricot, plum, pear, cherry, grape and apple however flavours such as elderflower, quince and all sorts of berries are starting to become more popular. - &lt;a href="https://www.travelgluttons.com/how-to-drink-palinka/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;How to Drink: Pálinka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Pálinka is generally not mixed.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Though some &lt;a href="http://www.amathusdrinks.com/cocktails-palinka" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;mixologists&lt;/a&gt; are experimenting with adding pálinka to their cocktails, you’ll usually find it served on its own. The wince you’ll make in anticipation as you catch a whiff of your shot is all part of the fun, as is the expected slamming of your glass onto the table once you’ve finished your drink. - &lt;a href="http://www.iamtheglobe.com/ogcblog/2016/7/20/hungarys-water-of-life" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Hungary’s Water of Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And again:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Pálinka should be served somewhere between 10 - 15 °C. While many drink it as a shot, the more traditional Hungarians will drink it as a low drink, sort of like whisky. Don’t be surprised if you hear people shouting ‘Isten, Isten’ (God, God) before drinking it, that is just part of the Pálinka tradition. - &lt;a href="https://drinkedin.net/blog/548-p%C3%A1linka-the-hungarian-whisky.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Pálinka - The Hungarian Whisky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hungarians love to eat sausages with their Pálinka, as can be seen at their &lt;strong&gt;Budapest Pálinka and Sausage Festival&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Sausage and pálinka go well together, so be sure to visit one of the sausage stands and sample their homemade products, such as Gyulai and Csabai kolbász. - &lt;a href="http://visitbudapest.travel/budapest-events/budapest-palinka-and-sausage-festival/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Budapest Pálinka and Sausage Festival&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It would depend on the crop the region had plenty of. Corn and rye would lean towards bourbon and wheat and potatoes towards vodka but it's all shine in the end. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would imagine it would be either whiskey or wine brandy came from Brandivine (excuse spelling or similar pronunciation) meaning burnt wine also cider was probably popular due to the fact that the water quality was poor &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It depends on the region. Most produced ales at the time were barley wines and meads, all reaching anywhere from 7% to 12% ABV. (Roughly, I am not an academic in this by any means.) As for liquor, I don't think liquors came around until later.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I finally did a little digging. The Late Medieval Period is generally considered from 1300-1500. Whisky, did not become wide spread until the 1700s. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The first recorded instance of Whisky production&lt;/a&gt; was in 1494: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The Guild of Barber Surgeons.[15] The earliest Irish mention of whisky comes from the seventeenth-century Annals of Clonmacnoise, which attributes the death of a chieftain in 1405 to "taking a surfeit of aqua vitae" at Christmas.[16] In Scotland, the first evidence of whisky production comes from an entry in the Exchequer Rolls for 1494 where malt is sent "To Friar John Cor, by order of the king, to make aquavitae", enough to make about 500 bottles.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is ample evidence that liquor distilled from grapes and other fermented fruit well before the 1300's and Brandy was widespread by 1500. Neither Brandy or Whisky was drunk as much as wine or beer during this period, but just from the time line it looks like Brandy was a) easier to make since you start with wine and no cooking involved until distillation b) had a several hundred year head start on Whisky. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There were distilled beverages in Asia, but again not as widespread as Brandy in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Just based on the fact that the first mention of Whisky production isn't until 1494, only 6 years before the end of the Late Medieval Period and Brandy production is mentioned many times in &lt;a href="http://www.alexreisner.com/misc/distilled-spirits" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The History and Taxonomy of Distilled Spirits&lt;/a&gt; before 1500, &lt;strong&gt;I think we can safely assume that Brandy was the most widespread distilled beverage in this time frame&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habushu" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Habushu&lt;/a&gt; is a common Japanese liqueur, where they put snakes inside the bottles. There are two methods of inserting the snake into the alcohol. The maker may choose to simply submerge the snake in the alcohol and seal the bottle, thus drowning the snake. Alternatively, the snake may be put on ice until it passes out, at which point it is gutted, bled and sewn up. When the viper is thawed and awakens, it will quickly die in an aggressive striking manner, which is what most producers look for. The manufacturer will then put the habu in an ethanol bath for a month to preserve it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can see pretty much anything in the bottle. &lt;a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-strangest-alcoholic-beverages-ever-to-touch-a-human-510836193" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; provides a good first look (trigger warning!).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Besides the stuff described there I witnessed bottles with exotic fish, giant prawns, and kelp. I even tasted some of them; we were not amused.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Starka does not age in bottles, and has no vintage, so I don't think it can be of any interest.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Tokay ages very well, and 70 years old one might be interesting. On the other hand, I have a serious reservations regarding Richon leZion wine-masters of 1947. I would expect something along the lines of Carmel wines, but less refined. It definitely has a great historic value, because it was produced prior to Israel statehood. Ask your Jewish friends.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have no say on other exhibits.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I recognize Strega. It is a digestif from Benevento, Italy. Flavor can become unstable over time. Used in some modern cocktails as well. I don't have my books in front of me, but it is normally more yellow, from saffron. An herbal liqueur. There's recipes using it in the PDT book and sometimes in Imbibe magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rakia&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Rakija&lt;/strong&gt; is the collective term for &lt;strong&gt;fruit brandy&lt;/strong&gt; popular in the Balkans. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakia" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; has this to say about Rakija:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Rakia or Rakija is the collective term for fruit brandy popular in the Balkans. The alcohol content of rakia is normally 40% ABV, but home-produced rakia can be stronger (typically 50%). &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Common flavours are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slivovitz" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;šljivovica&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, produced from plums, kajsija, produced from apricots, or grozdova/lozova in Bulgaria (raki rrushi in Albania), or "lozovača" or "komovica" in Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia and Bosnia produced from grapes, the same as "Zivania" in Cyprus. Fruits less commonly used are peaches, apples, pears, cherries, figs, blackberries, and quince. Similar spirits are produced in Romania, Moldova, Poland, Ukraine, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Russia and the Caucasus. In Albania, rakia is most commonly made out of grapes in mild climate regions and out of plums (and sometimes out of mulberry or walnuts) in colder climate areas. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Plum and grape rakia are sometimes mixed with other ingredients, such as herbs, honey, sour cherries and walnuts, after distillation. A popular home-made variant in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Macedonia, and Serbia is rakia produced from mixed fruits. In the Istrian and Dalmatian regions of Croatia, rakija tends to be home-made exclusively from grapes, where the drink is also known locally as trapa or grappa (the latter name also being used in Italy). &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Normally, rakia is colorless, unless herbs or other ingredients are added. Some types of rakia are kept in wooden barrels (oak or mulberry) for extra aroma and a golden color. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;It is supposed to be drunk from special small glasses which hold from 30 to 50 ml.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Greek ouzo (from grape) and tsipouro (from pomace), Turkish rakı (from sun dried grapes) and arak in Lebanon and Levant region differ from rakia as they are redistilled with some herbs (commonly anise). Some tsipouro in Greece is made without anise in the same manner as pomace rakia (or pomace brandy). "Boğma rakı" in Turkey (common name of the domestic raki which is produced at homes and villages) is similar to rakia in the Balkans. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slivovitz" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Slivovitz&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_brandy" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;fruit brandy&lt;/a&gt; made from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damson" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;damson&lt;/a&gt; plums. The primary producers are Bosnia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Serbia and Slovakia. The usual proof of private-produced slivovice is over 50% of alcohol in the final product, commercially available mass-produced slivovice is proofed less. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Šljivovica is the national drink of Serbia in domestic production for centuries, and plum is the national fruit. Šljivovica has a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO). Plum and its products are of great importance to Serbs and are a part of numerous traditional customs. A Serbian meal usually starts or ends with plum products and Šljivovica is served as an apéritif. A saying goes that the best place to build a house is where a plum tree grows the best. Traditionally, Šljivovica (commonly referred to as "rakija") is connected to a Serbian culture as a drink used at all important rites of passage (birth, baptism, military service, marriage, death, etc.). It is used in the Serbian Orthodox patron saint celebration, slava. It is used in numerous folk remedies, and is given certain degree of respect above all other alcoholic drinks. The fertile region of Šumadija in central Serbia is particularly known for its plums and Šljivovica. In 2004, over 400 000 litres of Šljivovica was produced in Serbia.  &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here follows a few sources on how to make some Raki (Brandy).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journeymacedonia.com/rakija/making-rakija/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Making Rakija – The Basics&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Making rakija involves five main stages: harvest, preparation for fermentation, fermentation, distillation and aging &amp;amp; storage.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://windowtobulgaria.blogspot.com/2013/01/how-to-make-rakia.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;How to Make Rakia (Ракия)&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;ol&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select a Fruit. Rakia is typically made from fruit, so the first thing you need to do is choose one. Grape and plum rakias are the two most traditional varieties, but Bulgarians make rakia out of whatever is readily available and cheap – apple, pear, peach, apricot, and cherry rakias are all popular in certain parts of the country. Other varieties are made less frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pick and Gather the Fruit. Once you’ve selected a fruit, you have to “pick” it. Picking a fruit is often as simple as going to the market and buying as much of it as you need. But grape vines and fruit trees grow aplenty in Bulgaria, and most Bulgarians hand-pick the fruit they use to make rakia. With grapes, this means waiting until the right time in fall and bringing together friends and family for a grape-picking weekend. With other fruits, Bulgarians typically wait until the fruit is slightly overripe and then they shake the fruit out of the tree by vigorously shaking the branches and/or swatting at the branches with a long stick. Only the fruit ripe enough to make rakia falls out of the tree, after which it is all collected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make Juice. Once you’ve collected the fruit, you mash it up, make juice, and dump it into a large barrel. The mashing process can be done by machine or the old-fashioned way – by foot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measure the Sugar Content and Add Dissolved Sugar as Necessary. After the fruit has been mashed into juice, you measure the concentration of sugar in the juice with a saccharometer (захаромер). An ideal reading for making rakia is 23°, and a sugary water solution of approximately three pounds of sugar to every gallon of water should be added to the mash until the ideal sugar level is attained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stir the Juice and Allow it to Ferment. The fruit juice will settle to the bottom, and the fruit skins will harden and float to the top of the mash. To make sure the juice ferments, it is necessary to push the fruit skins down and stir the juice once daily. The amount of time for proper fermentation depends in large part on the weather, but fermentation generally takes around three weeks. You might notice that thousands upon thousands of fruit flies are attracted to the mash. Don’t fret. Believe it or not, fruit flies assist greatly in the fermentation process. As a matter of fact, the Bulgarian word for fruit fly, муха-винарка, takes its name from the Bulgarian word for wine, вино, and literally translates to wine fly. Not surprisingly, more than one Bulgarian friend of mine hopes someday to be reincarnated as a муха-винарка.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distill the Fermented Juice. Distillation day is one of the most enjoyable days of the entire process; it is the day when rakia begins to flow. There isn’t much to the distillation process, although some people do a double distillation while others only do a single distillation. Regardless, the initial steps are the same. The mash is dumped into a still, which is sealed with a flour mixture to insure the still is air tight, and then a fire is lit under the still and distillation commences. Then you sit and wait. It typically takes about an hour before the first alcohol fumes begin to separate from the mash. This steam then makes its way through the sealed pipes before working its way through a cooling condenser and emerging as rakia. As the alcohol collects, measurements are taken. When I made rakia, we did a double distillation. On the first distillation, our rakia started with an alcohol content of around 60%, and we stopped the distillation when the alcohol content dropped to 20%. We then emptied and cleaned the still, dumped the alcohol we had produced into the still, and started a second distillation. On the second distillation, our rakia started with an alcohol content of 75%, and we stopped the distillation when the alcohol content dropped to 40%. The finished product was a potent 124 proof rakia (62% alcohol).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xh7DH.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xh7DH.jpg" alt="Distillation unit"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ol start="7"&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age the Rakia. Once distillation is complete, your rakia is ready to drink. Some Bulgarians do nothing more, but most prefer to age and dilute their rakia to make it more pleasurable to drink. Rakia may be diluted by adding distilled water until the desired alcohol percentage is attained. It may be aged as long and in whatever manner you see fit, but most Bulgarians only age their rakia long enough to give it some color and a little taste. We aged our rakia in oak chips for a month and added distilled water to make it more drinkable at 90 proof (45% alcohol).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enjoy. Of course, the final step of the rakia making process is drinking it and sharing it with friends. Хайде наздраве! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aENzWePXjMc" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Making of Traditional Croatian Rakia Brandy&lt;/a&gt; (YouTube video).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MnXSFq9qfg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Making Rakia with a Bulgarian Master&lt;/a&gt; (Youtube Video).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I once tried some quince brandy &lt;a href="http://www.theliquorbarn.com/srpska-trojka-quince-brandy-750ml/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;(Srpska Trojka Quince Brandy)&lt;/a&gt; and although I found it a great drink, I also admit that because of the quince one has to have an acquired taste for it. Plum Rakia would definitely be my next one to try. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bourbon and scotch are types of whiskey and cognac is a variety of brandy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Bourbon is a type of whiskey, whereas not all whiskies are bourbons! The main difference between scotch and whisky is geographic: they are made in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bourbon is a type of whiskey, whereas not all whiskies are bourbons!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.diffen.com/difference/Bourbon_vs_Whiskey" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Bourbon&lt;/a&gt; is a type of whiskey that gets its name from Bourbon County, Kentucky, where it originated. Bourbon tends to be amber-colored, and a little sweeter and heavier in texture than other whiskeys.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Scotch?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The main difference between &lt;a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/30278/what%E2%80%99s-difference-between-scotch-whiskey-and-bourbon" rel="noreferrer"&gt;scotch&lt;/a&gt; and whisky is geographic, but also ingredients and spellings. Scotch is whisky made in Scotland, while bourbon is whiskey made in the U.S.A, generally Kentucky. Scotch is made mostly from malted barley, while bourbon is distilled from corn. If you’re in England and ask for a whisky, you’ll get Scotch. But in Ireland, you’ll get Irish whiskey (yep, they spell it differently for a little colour).&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are whiskeys?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Whisky or whiskey is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash. Various grains (which may be malted) are used for different varieties, including barley, corn (maize), rye, and wheat. Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks, generally made of charred white oak. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Whisky is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types. The typical unifying characteristics of the different classes and types are the fermentation of grains, distillation, and aging in wooden barrels. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Whisky (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brandies&lt;/strong&gt; are not whiskeys, but is a spirit produced by distilling &lt;strong&gt;wine&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Brandy is a spirit produced by distilling wine. Brandy generally contains 35–60% alcohol by volume (70–120 US proof) and is typically drunk as an after-dinner digestif. Some brandies are aged in wooden casks, others are coloured with caramel colouring to imitate the effect of aging, and some are produced using a combination of both aging and colouring. Varieties of wine brandy can be found across the winemaking world. Among the most renowned are Cognac and Armagnac from southwestern France. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandy" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Brandy (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Cognac?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Cognac is a variety of brandy named after the town of Cognac, France. It is produced in the surrounding wine-growing region in the departments of Charente and Charente-Maritime. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Cognac production falls under French Appellation d'origine contrôlée designation, with production methods and naming required to meet certain legal requirements. Among the specified grapes Ugni blanc, known locally as Saint-Emilion, is most widely used.&lt;a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/30278/what%E2%80%99s-difference-between-scotch-whiskey-and-bourbon" rel="noreferrer"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; The brandy must be twice distilled in copper pot stills and aged at least two years in French oak barrels from Limousin or Tronçais. Cognac matures in the same way as whiskies and wine barrel age, and most cognacs spend considerably longer "on the wood" than the minimum legal requirement. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The white wine used in making cognac is very dry, acidic and thin. Though it has been characterized as "virtually undrinkable",&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandy" rel="noreferrer"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; it is excellent for distillation and aging. It may be made only from a strict list of grape varieties. In order for it to be considered a true cru, the wine must be at least 90% Ugni blanc (known in Italy as Trebbiano), Folle blanche and Colombard, while up to 10% of the grapes used can be Folignan, Jurançon blanc, Meslier St-François (also called Blanc Ramé), Sélect, Montils or Sémillon.&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armagnac_(brandy)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; Cognacs which are not to carry the name of a cru are freer in the allowed grape varieties, needing at least 90% Colombard, Folle blanche, Jurançon blanc, Meslier Saint-François, Montils, Sémillon, or Ugni blanc, and up to 10% Folignan or Sélect. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognac" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Cognac (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Armagnac brandy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Armagnac is a distinctive kind of brandy produced in the Armagnac region in Gascony, southwest France. It is distilled from wine usually made from a blend of grapes including Baco 22A, Colombard, Folle blanche and Ugni blanc, traditionally using column stills rather than the pot stills used in the production of cognac. The resulting spirit is then aged in oak barrels before release. Production is overseen by the Institut national de l'origine et de la qualité (INAO) and the Bureau National Interprofessionel de l'Armagnac (BNIA). - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armagnac_(brandy)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Armagnac (brandy)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One last note. There also exists a liquor that is generally known as &lt;strong&gt;fruit brandy&lt;/strong&gt; and is quite popular in various regions around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_brandy" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Fruit brandy&lt;/a&gt; or fruit spirit&lt;a href="https://www.diffen.com/difference/Bourbon_vs_Whiskey" rel="noreferrer"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; is a distilled beverage produced from mash, juice, wine or residues of culinary fruits. The term covers a broad class of spirits produced across the world, and typically excludes beverages made from grapes, which are referred to as plain brandy (when made from distillation from wine) or pomace brandy (when made directly from grape pomace). Apples, pears, apricots, plums and cherries are the most commonly used fruits. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;According to a legal definition in the United States, a "fruit brandy" is distilled "solely from the fermented juice or mash of whole, sound, ripe fruit, or from standard grape, citrus, or other fruit wine, with or without the addition of not more than 20 percent by weight of the pomace of such juice or wine, or 30 percent by volume of the lees of such wine, or both."&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;In the European Union, fruit brandies may not be labeled as "fruit brandy"; instead, the legal English denomination is fruit spirit, which is "produced exclusively by the alcoholic fermentation and distillation of fleshy fruit or must of such fruit, berries or vegetables, with or without stones".&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandy" rel="noreferrer"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; A great number of European fruit brandies have a protected designation of origin, and are labeled with their respective protected names instead of "fruit spirit" ("apricot spirit", etc.). Cider spirit and perry spirit (fruit brandy distilled from cider or perry) form a separate legal category. Some fruit spirits may be labeled with alternative names such as kirsch (cherry spirit) or slivovitz (plum spirit) regardless their country of origin.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;In British usage, "fruit brandy" may also refer to liqueurs obtained by maceration of whole fruits, juice or flavoring in a distilled beverage, and such liqueurs are legally labeled as "cherry brandy", "apricot brandy" etc. all across the European Union.&lt;a href="https://www.diffen.com/difference/Bourbon_vs_Whiskey" rel="noreferrer"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; Such beverages are used similar to cordials, and as an ingredient in cocktails and cakes. Fruit brandies obtained by distillation are often referred by the French term eau de vie.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Fruit brandy usually contains 40% to 45% ABV (80 to 90 US proof). It is often colourless. Fruit brandy is customarily drunk chilled or over ice, but is occasionally mixed. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The answer above nails the quantitative parts of the question, but I'll spend a little time adding a qualitative answer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In terms of flavour and the experience while drinking, Brandy and Whisky are quite similar. If you gave a taste test to a beginner they could easily mistake one for the other.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;At the same time, though, someone who was well versed in both liquors could likely distinguish between the two a majority of the time. While there are whiskies out there which border on cloying, brandy usually tends to be sweeter than most whiskies.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, the flavour profiles for whisky are also much broader. That is, you're likely to see much more variation in the qualitative aspects of whisky than you are brandy.&lt;/p&gt;
