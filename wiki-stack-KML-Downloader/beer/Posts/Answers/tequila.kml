					&lt;p&gt;Tequila has come a long way from when it was 1st manufactured, back in the day the traditional way to drink tequila was in a shot glass because it actually did taste like you were drinking paint stripper!... this is not the case anymore, now some tequila is drank from wide mouth cups and sipped like wine or a really nice bourbon. Contrary to popular belief tequila doest always give you the craziest hang over, at least not the newer tequilas since they are better quality, that is, if you are drinking &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt; tequila. Real tequila is made from the agave plant and depending on the region grown in Mexico ( south, north) will have a slight different taste. Sometimes you may find tequilas that say &lt;em&gt;mixto&lt;/em&gt; or mixed, &lt;strong&gt;stay away&lt;/strong&gt; from these types since they are not pure tequila and should not be drank without mixing it in a cocktail or mix drink. This mixto tequila will not taste as good and will give you a crappy headache the next day. There are different types of aging process for tequilas. There is the silver, gold or aged and extra aged, all have distinct flavors and undertones. Here is a good &lt;a href="http://tequilaconnection.com/index.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; with some tequila information and history also for tasting.
					So if the bottle says &lt;em&gt;mixed&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;mixto&lt;/em&gt; then it's for mixing and should not be drank alone unless you want to feel like a truck hit you the next day.
					Any other kind of &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; tequila should be ok, it all depends on taste and preference. 
					Just remember that the first swig you take &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; suppose to &lt;strong&gt;burn&lt;/strong&gt;, lol enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is just my opinion&lt;/em&gt;, but on a personal note, patron is over hyped and you can find way
					Better quality tequilas at a better price. I personally like casamigos the brand by George clooney it's actually pretty good, also &lt;em&gt;Don Julio&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Herradura&lt;/em&gt;  are good.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A general rule when it comes to liquor is that if it's a cheap, generic version of it's type then it's probably better mixed into a cocktail. This is because the cocktail masks the poor quality of the liquor, but you still get the kick of the alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if it's a high quality version of the liquor then the reason you should buy that liquor is for its own merits. For instance, I'd never buy a 100 dollar bottle of Scotch and mix it with ginger-ale, would be a big waste of money.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, alcohol is subjective so if you like drinking a cheap tequila straight that's your prerogative. In general, which you mix and which you drink straight is a matter of your own taste and research on what's a 'good' tequila.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For the most part more expensive tequila is better. For drinking go with 100% agave. For drinking most people prefer gold.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For margaritas mid to low end tequila seems to be just fine (I can't tell the difference). I think fresh squeezed lime does more for a margarita than expensive tequila. Most people prefer silver in margaritas.  I went to a party once and the guy was serving Patron and a margaritas mix - I was like dude time to skip the mix.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The big names are good but they also charge a premium.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Generally, the longer it's barrel aged, the more drinkable it is.  Anejo tequila is aged longest (I believe at least a year, but keep me honest).  Reposado is aged a bit less (6 months or so), and Blanco is generally not aged for any significant time.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can usually see it in the color of the tequila as well, (though many cheap tequilas are pretty amber in color, but certainly not aged very long or well, so this isn't a great measure of how good it is).  Blancos, as their name suggests, tend to be clear in color, Anejos can have a very deep, nearly brown color.  Reposados start to show some of the characteristics of a good tequila (pepper, etc), and Anejos can be downright complex.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I suggest that you don't drink Blancos straight.  Reposados can be good sipped and are great mixed, and are a good price point.  Most Anejos would be wasted as a mixed drink, and should be sipped.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not all types of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tequila" rel="noreferrer"&gt;tequila&lt;/a&gt; contain a tequila worm. The tequila worm or as it should be known as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezcal_worm" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Mezcal worm&lt;/a&gt; is normally only found in Mezcal (tequila). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The worm is reserved for a drink known as Mezcal, which, according to some, is tequila’s big brother. But the two spirits are entirely different. Tequila is distilled from any number of natural Mexican plants and can bear the name as long as the finished product consists of at least 51% agave. Mezcal must be 100% agave. - &lt;a href="http://www.flask.com/should-you-eat-the-tequila-worm/#.WLIr3_bTkdU" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Should You Eat the Tequila Worm?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most people would not eat the mezcal worm, but in some cultures it is quite acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;There are no proven side effects that come with consuming a Tequila worm. While the worm is popularly called the tequila worm, it is only found on the bottom of a bottle of mezcal, a variety of tequila obtained from distilling blue agave and similar plants. The meriposa worm is grown on agave from which mezcal is made, and when a worm is added to the mezcal, it is known as mezcal con gusano.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Consuming the worm after drinking mezcal is a popular tradition among many communities, but it is not clear where the tradition originated. Some believe that the adding the worm in a bottle of mezcal signifies the purity of the alcohol, as it hinders the disintegration of the worm. Others believe that it is merely a marketing strategy among Mexican liquor producers.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;While it's documented in media that the eating the worm causes hallucinations, this has yet to be medically proven. The worm is pickled in alcohol for more than a year and is made sure to be free to pesticides, before being added to mezcal. It is also a popular delicacy in Mexican restaurants, and is said to have positive psychological effects. - &lt;a href="https://www.reference.com/food/happens-someone-eats-tequila-worm-8c5ced1d2066f034#" rel="noreferrer"&gt;What happens when someone eats a Tequila worm?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for myself, I think I will pass on this offer!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking worms would be found in a drink called mescal or mezcal (same thing), and not in tequila. &lt;a href="http://mezcalphd.com/2012/08/tequila-vs-mezcal/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Mezcal is related to tequila&lt;/a&gt;, but not as well known outside of Mexico, which is why the worm in tequila myth started.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are two types of worms you can find in mezcal. The white worm is a larva of the beetle &lt;a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;amp;sl=es&amp;amp;u=https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scyphophorus_acupunctatus&amp;amp;prev=search" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Scyphophorus Acupunctatus&lt;/a&gt;. The red worm, the taster one, is a larva of the moth &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comadia_redtenbacheri" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Comadia Redtenbacheri&lt;/a&gt; from the Cossidae family of moths. They both invade agave plants (what tequila and mezcal are made from), which is why those are the worms that go in the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Choosing whether to eat it or not is entirely up to you. On the one hand, the mezcals that have a worm in the bottle are usually bad. It first appeared in bottles around the 1940's or 50's, likely as a marketing gimmick, so it's not some ancient tradition. Opposed to what some people claim it won't get you drunk, you won't hallucinate, and it won't make you horny. The booze is good enough at that stuff anyway. On the other hand, it does actually &lt;a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/that-worm-at-the-bottom-of-your-mezcal-isnt-a-lie-1" rel="noreferrer"&gt;change the mezcal's chemistry&lt;/a&gt; so you can't prove it's in there only for marketing. Both types of worm are eaten even when they aren't alcohol soaked, there are worm tacos and &lt;a href="http://www.foodrepublic.com/2016/05/03/what-is-sal-de-gusano-a-k-a-worm-salt-and-how-do-you-use-it/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;sal de gusano&lt;/a&gt; (gusano meaning worm so, worm salt). In Naturalis Historia, Pliny the Elder wrote that larvae, fattened up with flour, was one of the most delicate dishes and highly appreciated by Romans. In fact the larvae that Pliny wrote about may be of the same Cossidae family as the red mezcal worm. This book was written around 70 AD.... so there is some ancient history there after all. Most importantly though.... it's kind of fun. You get to say you ate the worm, most people won't. (Chants... dooo it, doooo it, doooo it.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I don't have any first hand knowledge about this, but I've heard this can be dangerous. Since tequila has alcohol, it isn't going to freeze. Depending on how cold the freezer is there may be potential for damage to tissues in your mouth. Perhaps this is or isn't true, but you might want to do some research before trying it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I did some casual Googling and found a lot of people freezing booze and drinking so perhaps typical freezer temperatures are Okay. One worrisome hit was &lt;a href="http://www.sharpman.com/combating_the_deep_freeze_cold_weather_injury_prevention.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this however&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Conduction is the transfer of heat to objects or substances in direct
					  contact. Your tongue sticking to the flagpole in grade school is a
					  perfect example of how tissue can almost instantly freeze when in
					  contact with cold metal, an excellent heat conductor. Keep in mind
					  that alcohol is also an excellent conductor and often freezes at much
					  colder temperatures than water, so if you bring a beer out on your
					  next cold-weather adventure, don’t throw back a few swigs until you’ve
					  checked its temperature. &lt;strong&gt;Extremely cold alcohol can instantly freeze
					  and damage your lips, tongue or other mouth tissue. And if the alcohol
					  comes in contact with your throat or esophagus, that can turn out to
					  be deadly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Storing tequila in the freezer?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I doubt that storing tequila in your freezer will make it taste better, but under certain conditions it could preserve the great taste of tequila. Storing your liquor in general in a freezer is not a bad idea at all, but is only possibly necessary at certain times.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;For the most part, there’s no need to refrigerate or freeze liquor whether it’s still sealed or already opened.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Hard liquors like vodka, rum, &lt;strong&gt;tequila&lt;/strong&gt;, and whiskey; most liqueurs, including Campari, St. Germain, Cointreau, and Pimm’s; and bitters are perfectly safe to store at room temperature. Essentially every liquor mentioned in this Bar Cart post on stocking your home bar with the &lt;em&gt;notable exception of already-opened vermouth&lt;/em&gt; can and should be stored without refrigeration.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;That notable exception of vermouth I mentioned above is because vermouth is actually a fortified wine. And like regular wine, it will eventually oxidize, so it needs to remain in the fridge once it’s been uncorked. Vermouth and dessert wines like vin santo, ice wine, and the like thankfully have a longer refrigerator shelf life than their regular wine counterparts, and won’t turn vinegary and sour in the span of a few days. But they will slowly start to lose their nuances of flavor, and after a few months—six, max—they’re probably goners. - &lt;a href="https://www.goodfoodstories.com/liquor-storage/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;How Should I Store My Booze?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Storing tequila&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Like almost any other alcohol (besides some liqueurs), tequila should be stored in a cool and dry area. Therefore, the pantry seems to be the best possible choice, but if you don’t plan to open the bottle within the next few weeks or months, you can store it in the cellar (if there’s not enough space in the pantry). After opening the bottle please remember that you should always keep the bottle tightly sealed when not in use. Don’t ever store it with a pourer on or without its cap.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Tightly sealed bottle ensures two things. First – any impurities won’t be able to find their way into the bottle. Second – if the bottle stays opened without its cap, the liquid evaporates quicker than when it’s sealed. Because alcohol evaporates quicker than water, your tequila will slowly become milder with time (after opening the bottle for the first time).&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;When the bottle is less than half full and you won’t consume the rest of its contents within a couple of weeks, it’s a good idea to pour the liquid into a smaller bottle. More air in the bottle equals faster evaporation and oxidation, both of them causing the quality of tequila to slowly deteriorate. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The  shelf life of tequila is indefinite if the seal remains undamaged. If not consuming your tequila in a relatively short time I would not hesitate to put it in the refrigerat&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;First thing that not everyone is familiar with is that spirits, unlike wines, don’t age after being bottled. &lt;strong&gt;That means that storing tequila for years won’t make its taste better.&lt;/strong&gt; When it comes to shelf life of tequila, it’s basically indefinite, as long as its seal isn’t compromised. If you store an unopened bottle in the pantry for quite a few years now, you can be almost sure that it’s fine now and it should be of great quality. After the bottle is opened for the first time, it’s recommended to drink tequila within a couple of months, when its quality is still at its best.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With freezing temperatures be sure your bottles will not explode.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The average home freezer is about &lt;strong&gt;-17 C (-1 F).&lt;/strong&gt; This is cold enough to freeze your food and ice, but not cold enough to freeze the average bottle of 80-proof liquor.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;■ Storing your favorite bottle of vodka in the freezer is okay.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;■ Placing that prized limoncello in the freezer for a quick chill is a good idea. &lt;a href="https://www.thespruce.com/will-liquor-freeze-760302" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;What is the Freezing Point of Alcohol?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yeah, tequila in the freezer is fine, and so is vodka, genever etc. Pour it in a shot glass, enjoy the syrupy texture and the foggy glass, have a small sip...you can't take a gulp because of the temperature. You probably can't taste much either due to frozen taste buds, but's it's a cool conversation starter and it saves on ice cubes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Me and my son ate the two worms that came in a bottle of mezcal we drank on his 21st birthday, it had no effect on us at all above the drunkeness we got from the mezcal apart from its foul taste that stayed for the next few hours. It tasted like wet rotten leather washed with ashtray juice and would be the worst thing i have ever swallowed. My son made his even worse by chewing it first! Definitely not worth trying at all! Even if it offerd some sort of extra kick or effect (which it does not) I would never do it again. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;sadly don't have a link for this, but had a tasting locally put on by a rep from Pierde Almas.   the way we were directed for a "traditional" drinking was in a snifter and served at room temp.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;He said that you should always start a drink with a deep smell.  to keep your mouth closed and you breathe in the scent, and then open it while taking this breathe so that you go from smelling to tasting the aromas. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You then take sips and let it sit in your mouth for about 10 seconds while you exhale slowly through your nose.   and that as you keep doing this, you will start to smell and taste all the Mezcal has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;again, I don't have any links for this.  just what I was told in person by the Rep.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First of all mezcal does not contain a worm, it's a hollywood misconception and if you ever find one do not drink it&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The average way to drink mezcal is just raw but there are other ways to drink it&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Salt or chilli powder around the edge of the caballito (the tiny glass)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Drops of lemon&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Mixed with grapefuit soda&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Mixed with mineral water&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Blue gatorade mixed with coconut cream (we call it pitufo or smurf)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Pomegranate glucose syrup and ginger beer with ice&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;and a couple of others I don't remember but these are the average ways to drink mezcal&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As you said, many of the traditions like salt &amp;amp; lime are primarily used to disguise low-quality tequila and mezcal. If you're buying a reposado, añejo, or aged mezcal, you'll want to get the full aroma and flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The colder the drink, the less aroma you get. Room temperature is recommended by most distilleries. Using a snifter glass, as Jedicurt suggested, lets you warm the liquor a bit more with your body temperature, which releases even more of the aromatics.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While I certainly know a lot of tequila and mezcal drinkers that add ice to their drinks -- I've been known to do it myself -- we'll generally add a single ice cube &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; taking that first big whiff to experience the aroma.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While there are mezcals that have the "worm" (it's actually a caterpillar or larva) in the bottle, they're generally the ones you want to avoid if you're drinking for flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Tequila is only produced inside the Mexican state of Jalisco and in some municipalities in Guanajuato, Michoacan, Nayarit, and Tamaulipas. &lt;strong&gt;Any agave-based distilled spirit outside those regions are called "mezcal."&lt;/strong&gt; Other subtypes of mezcal you might see are Bacanora, Sotol and Raicilla. In other words, all tequilas are mezcals, but not all mezcals are tequila. (Just like all bourbons are whiskeys but not all whiskeys are bourbons. )&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What is Tequila when its not from Mexico?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tequila&lt;/strong&gt; is a regional distilled beverage and type of alcoholic drink made from the blue agave plant, primarily in the area surrounding the city of Tequila, 65 km (40 mi) northwest of Guadalajara, and in the highlands (Los Altos) of the central western Mexican state of Jalisco. Aside from differences in region of origin, tequila is a type of &lt;strong&gt;mescal&lt;/strong&gt; (and the regions of production of the two drinks are overlapping). The distinction is that tequila must use only blue agave plants rather than any type of agave. Tequila is commonly served neat in Mexico and as a shot with salt and lime across the rest of the world. - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tequila" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Tequila (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Within Mexico tequila terms are somewhat varied as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://cheersonline.com/2017/04/12/whats-the-difference-tequila-mezcal-bacanora-raicilla-and-sotol/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;What’s The Difference: Tequila, Mezcal, Bacanora, Raicilla, Sotol?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;A wide range of spirits can be distilled from agaves. Here’s a quick rundown of that spectrum and a look at what defines each different category of agave spirits [from Mexico]:&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tequila&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Tequila is a type of mezcal produced under strict regulations as to how and where it can be made. Tequila is fermented and distilled from a single type of agave plant, Agave tequilana Weber blue. Tequila is not smoky because the agave hearts are steamed or kilned during production; it can only be produced in Jalisco, and designated areas in four other Mexican states. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The best tequilas are 100% blue agave, which is noted on the label. Distinctions are often made between tequila made from blue agave grown in highland regions, which tend to be fruitier, and from lowlands, which are earthier. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mezcal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Mezcal is the over-arching category of Mexican spirits fermented and distilled from several varieties of the agave plant. It is produced all over Mexico under various names and designations, including tequila. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Bottles labeled “mezcal” are usually from the state of Oaxaca and often have a smoky flavor because during production the agave hearts are roasted in rock-lined pits fired by mesquite. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bacanora&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Named for the eponymous town in Sonora, this mezcal variant is made from wild plants of agave Pacifica. Bacanora is often lighter and less smoky than most mezcals, even though the agaves are also pit roasted.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raicilla&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Like tequila, raicilla is made in Jalisco state; unlike tequila, it is made from two varieties of agave—lechuguilla and puta de mula. Raicilla tends to be sweeter and fruitier than most other mezcals. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sotol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Although a gringo might mistake it for agave, sotol is made from another succulent plant called Desert Spoon. Produced mainly in the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Durango and Coahuila, the process is similar to mezcal, with roasting of the hearts of Desert Spoon in volcanic rock-lined pits. Flavor varies according to the terroir, say aficionados; predominately herbal notes, as well as eucalyptus, pepper and cocoa, with lighter smoke accents.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Outside of Mexico Tequila and Mezcal are known as &lt;a href="http://www.ianchadwick.com/tequila/rsa.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Agava&lt;/a&gt; in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agava&lt;/strong&gt; was also available in bottled form. Agave Distillers claimed to be moving between 12,000 and 15,000 cases a month at its peak. The bottled form has been sold in the LCBO, in Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agava&lt;/strong&gt; is labeled an agave product and not a tequila product.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;It should be noted that all Tequilas are agave spirits, but like Champagne or Port there is a protection of the Appellation of Origin in order to call it “Tequila”, so South African producers are forced to label their drink as Agave Spirit and not Tequila. - &lt;a href="https://drinksfeed.com/tequila-industry-taking-shape-in-south-africa/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Tequila industry taking shape in South Africa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HiDML.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HiDML.jpg" alt="Agava"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In California, some are trying to name their agave product &lt;a href="https://punchdrink.com/articles/hecho-in-america-distilling-agave-spirits-stateside/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;“El Ladron,"&lt;/a&gt;which means “the thief”. This too is not to be known as a tequila product, but as an agave spirit product.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Before closing my answer, I would to mention that the first agave beverage that was ever fermented is known as &lt;strong&gt;Pulque&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;This sweet beverage has a long history in Mexico. Before mezcal or tequila, there was pulque, the first fermented agave beverage. Murals that date as far back as 200 A.D. in Cholula, Mexico show villagers drinking pulque. While it’s relatively low in alcohol and more like an agave beer, it was the agave beverage that started it all.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Pulque is a product of the sap of the heart of agave. Rather than being distilled like mezcal or tequila, it’s fermented from the "honey water" of the plant. This sacred beverage has milky like appearance and is sweet in flavor. If you want a taste of Mexico, then try the fermented agave beverage that started it all. - &lt;a href="http://www.wideopeneats.com/tequila-sotol-guide-agave-spirits-mexico/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;From Tequila to Sotol, Your Guide to the Agave Spirits of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
