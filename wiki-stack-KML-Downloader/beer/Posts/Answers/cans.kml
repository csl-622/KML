					&lt;p&gt;First, I love this question because it is actually interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I researched this when I noticed that bottled coke tasted so much better than canned coke. Cans keep out all light so the contents actually never become tainted. The reason that most like bottled over canned is because they like the taste with those impurities. 
					Some complain that they can taste aluminum with cans, but this is more than likely in their head since cans are lined with a thin layer of plastic. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I like certain beers better in cans and certain ones better in bottles. I would try both :)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I heard a quote from the revered &lt;a href="http://foodscience.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/cbamforth"&gt;Charlie Bamforth&lt;/a&gt;, who basically said that packaging beers in cans was a far better way to preserve the beer from brewery to customer than packaging in bottles, but bottles are still more aesthetically pleasing to the customer, so they are usually preferred. And that's from a man that has been head of Quality Assurance for a number of years. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's purely in the mind - there isn't any real change to the beer. If anything, the difference with bottled beer is that the canned version is better preserved.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a member of a Studentenverbindung, having one principle of scientia, we of course tested this a long time ago with around a dozen or maybe a bit more testers. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;We poured beer from the same manufacturer (fresh batch) into glasses and had people taste them, and for every glass (everyone had multiple ones) they had to say if they think it was from a bottle, a can, or a keg, and which tasted better.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;After around 50 or 60 glasses, there was no statistical evidence whatsoever that any of the three could be identified, or tasted better.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From my personal experience though, I always think that a keg  is better than a bottle is better than a can. But why is that so? I only have the theory that due to the feeling of the container you drink from, your taste is altered (just like food with the same flavour/taste somehow tastes different, with a different texture). Additionally I think the amount of beer that flows into your mouth is different, as well as maybe the turbulence, causing a different amount of carbon dioxide (or nitrogen, depending on your beer culture) to leave the beer before you can actually taste and swallow (which again changes the texture).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I actually do not think that the can itself changes the taste of the beer as much as the beer placed in the can may be a little different. I think that the real difference is going to be between keg beer and can/bottle beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Canned/bottled beer has a longer shelf life than keg beer. Canned/bottled beer has a shelf life of roughly 45-60 days, whereas a keg is only 25-40 days &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.micromatic.com/beer-questions/how-long-keg-beer-remain-fresh-aid-44.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This means that worst case scenario for comparison you could be tasting a 2 month old canned beer versus a 3 week old draft. It can cause a difference in taste, there is a "freshness date" after all. (See this &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/a/502/303"&gt;excellent answer from @mdma for more information on what happens as beer ages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But where does this date come from? Almost all imported retail beer is pasteurized. The reason for pasteurizing the beer is from a business standpoint. It basically allows the beer to last longer and be shipped at room temperature (this applies to kegs, cans, and bottles). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;An alternative to the pasteurization process is bottle conditioning. Most domestic beers follow this path. Essentially this process involves beers being sterile filtered and chilled to the point that any surviving bacteria, which could ferment the beer, become dormant &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.micromatic.com/beer-questions/pasteurized-and-non-pasteurized-keg-beer-aid-45.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So basically the probability that the beer begins to ferment is higher over time. A canned beer and a keg beer can taste the same if they both left the brewery at the same time, and both experienced the same conditions during the time it took them to reach you. It is just that kegs have a better chance of taking less time and of being better preserved.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From a practical standpoint though, bottles can cause broken glass, kegs weigh close to 50 lbs. full, and cans allow for shotgunning. Make sure your container of choice fits your environment :)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1. &lt;a href="http://www.micromatic.com/beer-questions/how-long-keg-beer-remain-fresh-aid-44.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;How long will a keg of draft beer remain fresh?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					&lt;sub&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://www.micromatic.com/beer-questions/pasteurized-and-non-pasteurized-keg-beer-aid-45.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;What is pasteurized and non-pasteurized keg beer?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.breweriana.com/"&gt;Breweriana&lt;/a&gt; has a database of collectable beer paraphernalia with prices.  Tick the "include All (In-Stock &amp;amp; Sold)" button for their complete range.  They're trying to sell to you, of course, so their prices are probably a bit higher than you'd getting selling the same thing, but it's useful if you have an item you want to get valued.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ebay, on the other hand, is more limited but more practical.  It's a good first stop for selling any collectable, since you can see what people have actually gotten for items.  That'll be the most accurate price estimate, although you're not likely to find &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; rare stuff on there because of the small audience.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, there are a number of books on the subject, of which breweriana helpfully lists &lt;a href="http://www.breweriana.com/beer-can-appraisal/books-on-beer-cans.html"&gt;a few&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finally, the &lt;a href="http://www.bcca.com/"&gt;BCCA&lt;/a&gt; is the largest organization around beer can collecting, and have a lot of resource son the subject.  You can use their site to find a local chapter and ask someone about your specific collection in person.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To expand on this a little, here is a really quick guide:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;If it's from the mid 70s or so on, it's probably not that valuable.  Exceptions sometimes include aluminum cans, cans with &lt;a href="http://imgs.inkfrog.com/pix/UncleDearest/Vintage_Miller_High_Life_1956_Flat_Top_Beer_Can.jpg"&gt;punch tops&lt;/a&gt;, and cans with &lt;a href="http://www.beercansrus.com/mcart/images/reischcone1.jpg"&gt;cone tops&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;If it's in poor condition, it's probably not worth much unless it's quite rare.  Unless it's better than "grade 2" (defined as "Has a clean label, but there may be rust or other blemishes near the seam, the lid, or the bottom. Colors may be irregular"), it's probably not valuable.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;American OIs (opening instructions, named after the instructions that came with them on how to open them) can be worth $35 to $1000.  Most others before the 70s will have a chance of being between $10 and $500, depending on their rarity.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No for the cans; maybe for the contents.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While it's hard to predict the future, we can infer from the past.  As it stands, beer cans as old as 40 years are pretty much worthless (with a few exceptions).  This is because right around the mid 70s, beer can collection as an activity exploded.  Beer cans before that point became valuable, but beer cans from after that point were heavily collected (up through the present day), and are therefore pretty low value.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;TLDR: There exist too many well-preserved beer cans from the current era for them to be worth anything in the next 20 years at least (and probably well through the next 40-60 years).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That's just the cans, though.  Exceptions might be very specific beers known to be age-able for decades.  Unfortunately, most beers just don't age that long.  Even a hearty barely wine usually peaks, at most, after a couple years.  The Stone Vertical Epic 020202 series was meant to be aged 10 years, which is unusually long for a beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you could find a beer you reasonably believed would improve over the course of several decades, you might be able to get some money out of it if it were stored properly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I don't know how/if the actual storage in cans vs bottles affects the taste, however you should expect that they are not filled with the same beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Many companies will have different production logistics, and the can will often come from a different site than a bottle of the same brand, and will have slightly different water and production process, so the beers will taste slightly different before they even touch the can; and they may even have intentionally different production and additives.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are drinking beer directly from the can or bottle, then one measurable difference is the speed at which it warms up while you are drinking it.  As glass is an insulator and aluminium is a conductor, you'd expect the can to be more efficient at transferring heat from your hand and the environment into the beer.  So a glass bottle should keep the within the optimum temperature range for longer than the can.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This result is backed up by some &lt;a href="http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-031609-100626/unrestricted/MQPFinal.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;research done by students at Worcester Polytechnic Institute&lt;/a&gt;, which compared the rate at which refrigerated liquid warms up to room temperature in glass and aluminium bottles.  The heating rate differences should be even more noticeable if the bottles were in contact with a body temperature heat source.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This effect can be minimised by insulating the can using a stubby holder/beer cozy.  In another experiment &lt;a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/science/beer_cozy/beer_cozy.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;comparing cans held in a person's hand&lt;/a&gt;, over a 30 minute period an uninsulated can rose in temperature by about 14°C while the insulated can rose only 3°C.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not likely, unless there are some rare beers in there that benefit from aging and are kept in the right conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most beers will oxidize over time, even with a sealed cork or cap a minute amount of oxygen can permeate the seal, over the course of 20 years this could damage the beer.  Some companies may wax dip their beers as well, in many cases wax dipping is more for aesthetics but can also help minimize oxygen exchange for periods of long storage.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Only certains beers are suited for aging, such as some lambics, saisons, Belgian quads, and high ABV stouts and barleywines, to name a few.  Even for some of these it may be noted to cellar for no more than 3-5 years.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For long term aging you also need to maintain temperatures in the range of 55°F.  This temperature should be held consistently with any major swings up or down being avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Outside of this you would need to have beers that are rare and highly sought after today to have even a chance of them being valuable in the future.  Even if you picked out 20 of the most sought after beers today it's important to remember tastes change and they may not be sought after in 20 years.  Just look at the changes the American craft beer environment has gone through in 20 years!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Glass vs bottle or can will be a pretty noticeable difference with most styles of beer simply due to the size of the opening.  When you pour from the storage vessel to the glass you disturb the beer a lot which drives CO2 gas out, and that takes a lot of aromatics with it so the aroma you get from the beer in a glass is WAY stronger and more complex than what you'd sniff from the bottle or can.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also smell is a pretty huge part of tasting something and when you drink from a glass you're putting your nose right into the thick of all that, so the flavor will be more intense as well.  Bottles and cans sort of keep that toned down since you don't smell the beer as much.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There used to be a prejudice against cans because the liquid and the aluminum would react and oxidize, but they started coating the insides with a food safe epoxy resin decades ago and it's completely sealed now.  As far as taste goes there's no difference between the two, but cans actually store a bit better because they let in no light and no air while bottles will eventually let through enough to affect the beer.  Brewers like cans as well since they're more portable, don't shatter, chill faster, and are often cheaper to fill.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would add that beer that tends to last longer in a can because of way it's sealed.  No bottle cap for leaking oxygen and light can't penetrate so it's not going to be ruined as fast when it's sitting in the store fridge under the fluorescent lights&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's called a floating widget and is used (together with nitrogen instead of carbondioxide) to give the beer it's typical, creamy head when poured from the can. The method was invented by the Guinness Brewery in the 1960ies.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Cite from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget_(beer)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Some canned beers are pressurized by adding liquid nitrogen, which vaporises and expands in volume after the can is sealed, forcing gas and beer into the widget's hollow interior through a tiny hole - the less beer the better for subsequent head quality. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;When the can is opened, the pressure in the can quickly drops, causing the pressurised gas and beer inside the widget to jet out from the hole. This agitation on the surrounding beer causes a chain reaction of bubble formation throughout the beer. The result, when the can is then poured out, is a surging mixture in the glass of very small gas bubbles and liquid.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You are in luck! There is a retro can operation called the Chuchkey Beer Co. that is canning beer in the old style flat top cans that you need a churchkey to open (I think they supply one with the case). Looks like it's only available on the West Coast. Enjoy it if you can find it! &lt;a href="http://www.churchkey.com/home.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Chuchkey Beer Co.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
