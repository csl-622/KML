					&lt;p&gt;There are a few theories out there, and their veracity, like that of most historical "facts", is hotly debated.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One theory begins in 1722 when Ralph Harwood, a London brewer, created a beer called &lt;em&gt;Entire&lt;/em&gt;.  For some time, working folk had been drinking a blend of beer, ale, and strong beer, which pubs would mix to balance out their stocks and maintain acceptable flavor.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entire&lt;/em&gt; was a pre-mixed version, brewed by Hardwood then sold and delivered to pubs.  Prior to this point, each pub had mixed their own.  In addition to economies of scale, Harwood's method allowed for aging of the finished product.  Historians theorize that the name &lt;em&gt;porter&lt;/em&gt; came about because of the porters who worked at the markets and delivered the final product to the pubs.  A variation of this theory suggests that &lt;em&gt;porter&lt;/em&gt; simply refers to the working class occupations of those who drank the concoction.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another theory suggests that &lt;em&gt;porter&lt;/em&gt; comes from the Netherlands, where a beer called &lt;em&gt;poorter&lt;/em&gt; was being made as early as the 1300s.  The Dutch were prolific traders, and cultural transfer could easily have occurred.  The term &lt;em&gt;poorter&lt;/em&gt; originally concerned inhabitants of walled cities and may also have been related to social station.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's hard to say either way unless we find a primary source (someone privy to the company's strategies), but I think a refinement of your question might be—&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Are any ingredients for brewing either unavailable or prohibitively expensive depending on season?&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I doubt this is the case—if an ingredient were impractical to obtain in other seasons but one, then I'd imagine the price of that seasonal beer would be extraordinary, which isn't the case with Sam Adams' seasonal beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If by chance there &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; exist such ingredients, then the next question is—are any of those ingredients used in Sam Adams' seasonal beers, which itself is a difficult question, since Sam Adams' recipes are proprietary. From Sam Adams' site, though,&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Samuel Adams® Octoberfest is a malt lover's dream, masterfully blending together five roasts of barley to create a delicious harmony of sweet flavors including caramel and toffee. The beer is kept from being overly sweet by the elegant bitterness imparted by the German Noble hops.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Unless one of those "five roasts of barley" (providing the above is even true and not a marketing statement itself) is some rarity in other seasons, which I highly doubt, again, I'd say mass produced seasonal beers are only "seasonal" for the sake of marketing and inducing a certain feel—&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Samuel Adams® Octoberfest provides a wonderful transition from the lighter beers of summer to the winter's heartier brews.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I feel guilty posting this as an answer, since, it's not a definitive answer, but I don't feel the question &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be answered by anyone but a primary source, so perhaps this question should be closed instead—but I don't know what the appropriate reason would be.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A few notes on brewing and the seasons.  It isn't a question of availability today but there are other factors that likely have seasonal impact.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Traditionally (say, 1000 years ago), yes, brewing recipes would vary with the seasons.  Some ingredients like henbane seed or barley keep extremely well.  Others do better  fresh (herbs and such).  It is likely that gruit components varied with the seasons.  This is not an issue today.  Aside from some components of other beers (pumpkin ale, beers with seasonal fruit), most beers today do not involve ingredients that are problematic to preserve over a year.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is a second issue though.  That is that beers traditionally have another factor which is starch content.  The starch contributes significantly to calorie count of the beer, and usually darker, richer beers have higher carbohydrate count.  It makes sense to consume more calories in cold weather than warm weather, and it makes sense that darker, heavier beers would be favored in winter while lighter beers would be favored in summer (although as one would note the heavier beers came out of traditions of using them as bread substitutes for fasting monks and so would have year-round applicability in monasteries).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I don't think it has to do with availability.  I think instead it has to do with seasonal expectations and reserving richer, heavier, higher starch beers for the winter (we have higher metabolism in winter, see &lt;a href="http://www.mate.tue.nl/mate/pdfs/4319.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.mate.tue.nl/mate/pdfs/4319.pdf&lt;/a&gt;, and generally less availability of fresh foods before modern refrigeration and rapid transport).  I don't know when this became common though.  In general, when I look back a thousand years ago, I don't see anything in primary sources to suggest heavier malts in the winter.  So trying to date this would seem speculative.  There is a fairly obvious practical pattern though.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;:  As I think about this, I would note that aside from lagers, it is very hard to brew in the winter in a colder climate.  There may also be a component where heavier, stronger beers keep better and therefore keep into the winter better.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would suggest the app Untapped. It gives you an opportunity to comment on beers and include pictures and locations. You can even earn badges that notate various "beer achievements."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have personally used Pintley on iOS (but it's cross platform) and found it to be a pretty good app.  The quality of the graphics isn't intensely refined, but the beer list is very comprehensive.  I found that the beer list was one of the most important things in an app like this, since I was usually in quick situations when I wanted to record and rate a beer.  I didn't want to be out with friends and browsing through a ton of pages to finally have to input all the details of a beer that was fairly common.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine just switched to Beer Citizen (also cross platform), which seems to have a more refined look.  I've done some searching through the database though, and there seems to be quite a bit missing...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In my opinion most of such apps are not what you really need and they often lack something. Therefore I simply use Google Drive Spreadsheet. As cheap as it sounds, it has everything that you want out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My first temptation is to say none.  However there are two mitigation strategies to this dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The first is mulled beer, you need a light IPA, a saucepan, cinnamon and star anise.  Put the beer in the pan, add the spices and heat.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The second strategy, and one I've used, is camp near a stream.  Store the beer in the stream in a net bag or similar.  Any beer works in this situation and it will cool the beer to a drinking temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Somewhat related: &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/q/5/73"&gt;What temperature should I serve my beer?&lt;/a&gt; In short, beers don't need to be served as cold as many are led to believe, and darker beers tend to be meant to serve warmer (as warm as 55°F). You certainly don't want to drink warm Coors, so maybe bring along some stouts.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In case there isn't a stream around to do what @user23614 suggests, bring some newspapers. Wet a sheet of newspaper and wrap the bottle with a single layer. Leave the bottle somewhere the breeze can blow on it, until most of the water evaporates. This is probably a common camping trick, but I first saw Moroccans in the Sahara Desert do this to chill a bottle of wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;at room temperature the flavour of the beer starts to intensify,some people would say it gets more bitter.
					I tried something that worked ..there a beers like Kingfisher Light...that have pretty good carbonation content.
					So even at room temperature u get a good time.You can try any other beer that has strong carbonation..and LITTLE mild in flavour.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Short answer: no beer that has color-changing mountains on the side should be served warm, otherwise you'll taste it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Long answer: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, ales are traditional served warmer than pilseners, so start your selection there. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Second consideration is sweet/bitter balance. Sweetness generally becomes &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7070/abs/nature04248.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;stronger&lt;/a&gt; with warmer beer. Something with a bit of sour would probably hold up well when warm. At the same time, styles that are meant to be sweet are usually served at/close to room temp: barleywines, or anything imperial/double/doppel/strong. Bonus: you won't have to carry as much.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Third: can you get it in a can? Cleaning up that campsite will be so much easier the next morning...&lt;/p&gt;
