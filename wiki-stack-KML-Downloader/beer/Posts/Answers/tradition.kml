					&lt;p&gt;I don't think the Irish really care too much as long as they have a drink in front of them. How about Irish Whiskey and Guinness? Maybe some Irish Coffee, Bailey's or cider. All the Irish I know aren't too picky. I don't think you find too much green beer in Ireland, that's a made up American thing. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Isn't Saint Valentine Irish? I would be drinking a Guinness then! Oh, but you asked for wine... You could celebrate with the blood of Christ and drink a nice Italian Red Wine, like a nice aged &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarone" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Amarone&lt;/a&gt;. But really this is a celebration and that calls for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;CHAMPAGNE&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As you're planning well ahead, good man, I'd suggest you pair your celebration with the Umbria, as he was Valentinus of Terni, in central Italy. Poor man, bits of him, his relics, are in churches all over, in Dublin, as well as in Rome and Savona, Madrid, Prague, Vienna, Birmingham, Glasgow, Malta, Greece, and France.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Umbrian truffi, truffles, suggests strangozzi (pasta) with black truffles, paired with Montefalco Sagrantino, or gallina ubriaca, drunken hen, a chicken cooked wine; cook it in Montefalco Rosso and, what else, pair it Montefalco Rosso (after all, you don't want to cook with a wine you wouldn't drink).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And then there's Perugia, the capitol of Umbria, and Perugina Baci, kisses, chocolate, how appropriate. Pair that with an Orvieto Classico or Grechetto Bianco. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally, I have never had &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haggis" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;haggis&lt;/a&gt;, but pairing it with wine is not all that uncommon. &lt;strong&gt;Some even pair it with beer&lt;/strong&gt; as can be seen &lt;a href="https://www.matchingfoodandwine.com/news/entertaining/planning-a-burns-night-dinner/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but I would go with a sweet fruity red wine. Pairing wine with haggis is very common on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is a sample of how people wine with haggis:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;A dram of whisky works better after the meal, as its sheer strength means it doesn’t go with the food, so which wine to open first? Red, of course, and something with enough richness to take on haggis, which is sheep’s (occasionally pig’s) “pluck” – the heart, liver and lights (lungs) – mixed with oatmeal, spices and seasoning. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;If you’re still with me (Susy Atkins) and up for it, a bold European red with a little savouriness and black pepper is by far the best. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Spanish tempranillo, aged in oak casks, and tasting of ripe red berries, wood spice and vanilla, is my favourite match. - &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinkadvice/11361111/Why-Ill-be-drinking-red-wine-not-whisky-with-my-haggis.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Why I'll be drinking red wine - not whisky - with my haggis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is another:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Haggis is quite a funky-tasting meat - a bit like a savoury, spicy sausage - so I think red wine is a better match than white. I’ve found big jammy reds such as Australian shiraz work well (there is appropriately enough one called Bobbie Burns shiraz (available for about £15-£16 from independents including &lt;a href="http://www.ahadleigh-wine.com/products/4993/Campbells+Bobbie+Burns+Shiraz+Rutherglen/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Alexander Hadleigh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.oldbutcherswinecellar.co.uk/campbell-s-bobbie-burns-shiraz-2010.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Old Butcher's Wine Cellar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Northern Rhône syrah and grenache/syrah/mourvèdre (GSM) blends from the southern Rhône, the Languedoc and Australia are also good matches, especially if they have a year or two’s bottle age. - &lt;a href="https://www.matchingfoodandwine.com/news/pairings/the-best-wines-to-pair-with-haggis/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The best wines to pair with haggis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And finally:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Wine pairing with haggis – grape growing and winemaking techniques&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Grapes grown in hotter climates often have riper fruit which add to flavour intensity and texture of the wine; but also the sugar levels in the grapes are generally much higher adding further mouthfeel, so a sign is to look for wines that have perhaps 13.5% or above alcohol by volume. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Oak fermentation and/or oak ageing adds flavour and texture too, so clues are sometimes on the label; be aware &lt;strong&gt;‘oaked’&lt;/strong&gt; is not generally a style that adds texture, look for the word &lt;strong&gt;‘aged’&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure it has seen the inside of an oak cask. This week on our WSET Level 2 Wine Course we had an outstanding Puligny-Montrachet and also a equally impressive Chateauneuf-du-Pape, both would have successfully met the haggis-pairing challenge. &lt;a href="http://enjoydiscoveringwine.com/2014/01/burns-night-wine-pairing-haggis/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Burns Night – wine pairing with haggis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;All said and done: Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think haggis calls for a whisky barrel-aged porter, an Irish stout, or a peated malt ale, preferably in vast quantities so that you: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;don't know what you're eating,&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;don't eat because you're too drunk.&lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have tried this with a nice Reposado, and it works well. But you are much better off with a nice whisky.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Or any other drink - it doesn't really matter. If you have a nice haggis the drink is irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is the usual great stuff relating to 'Toasting'. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toast_(honor)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;From wikipedia - which is normally correct.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I then had a quick look at snopes.com, they proclaim the following to be false:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Q: Why do people clink their glasses before drinking a toast?
					  A: It used to be common for someone to try to kill an enemy by offering him a poisoned drink. To prove to a guest that a drink was safe, it became customary for a guest to pour a small amount of his drink into the glass of the host. Both men would drink it simultaneously. When a guest trusted his host, he would then just touch or clink the host’s glass with his own.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;ORIGINS:   Many explanations have been advanced to explain our custom of clinking glasses when participating in toasts. One is that early Europeans felt the sound helped to drive off evil spirits. Another holds that by clanking the glasses into one another, wine could be sloshed from glass to glass, thereby serving as a&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wine glasses&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;proof the beverages had not been poisoned. Yet another claim asserts that the “clink” served as a
					symbolic acknowledgment of trust among imbibers who did not feel the need to sample each others’ drinks to prove them unadulterated.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Each of those explanations is false. While making a racket for the purpose of scaring off evil spirits underpins other customs that carry over to this day (e.g., the tolling of church bells at weddings, and the loud shouts and noisemaking at the stroke of twelve on New Year’s Eve), the “clink” is a relatively new aspect of toasting and, as such, came along well after folks had relinquished the notion that demons both lurked in every corner of typical day-to-day existence and could be sped on their way by a bit of noise. As for sloshing wine from one glass to another, drinking vessels would need to be filled to the brim to effect that, and if they were, such practice would waste valuable potables (because some would be sure to land on the floor) and likely douse the toasters too. And while the poisoning of enemies has long been part of the ordinary mayhem of the world, the practice of touching of one’s filled glass to those of others when participating in a toast is unrelated to suspicion of the wine’s having been tampered with; such killings were not so common at any nebulous point in the past that a signal to one’s host indicating he was clear of suspicion of attempted murder needed to be enshrined in the canon of social gestures.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To get at the real reason for the clink of glass on glass, we have to first look at why and how we toast, and where the practice originated.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The custom of sealing with booze expressions of good wishes for the health of others dates back so far that its origins are now lost to us, yet in numerous cultures&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;such acts of camaraderie often involved shared drinking vessels. The clinking of individual cups or glasses as a proof of trust wouldn’t have meant much when
					everyone drank from the same bowl. Indeed, in those cultures where shared drinking containers was the norm, to produce one’s own vessel in such company was to communicate an unmistakable message of hostility and distrust; it would have been regarded as akin to bringing along a food taster to sample the repast.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;“Toasting,” our term for the pronouncement of benedictions followed by a swallowing of alcohol, is believed to have taken its name from a practice involving a shared drinking vessel. Floated in the “loving cup” passed among celebrants in Britain was a piece of (spiced) cooked bread that the host would consume along with the last few drops of liquid after the cup had made one round of the company. In modern times toasting has become a matter of imbibing from individual drinking vessels rather than from one shared flagon, so to compensate for the sense of unity lost in doing away with the sharing of the same cup we have evolved the practice of simultaneously drinking each from our own glass when a toast is made, thereby maintaining a communal connection to the kind words being spoken.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The clinking of glasses has been added to the practice of offering toasts for a few reasons, none having anything to do with poison. Prior to such augmentation, toasts pleased only four of the five senses; by adding the “clink,” a pleasant sound was made part of the experience, and wine glasses have come to be prized not only for their appearance but also for the tones they produce when struck. Yet beyond mere aural pleasure, the act of touching your glass to that of others is a way of emphasizing that you are part of the good wishes being expressed, that you are making a physical connection to the toast. The practice also serves another purpose, that of uniting the individuals taking part in the benediction into a cohesive group: as the wine glasses are brought together, so symbolically are the people holding them. On a deeper level, the wine is also being recommuned with itself — that which had been one (when it had been in its own bottle) but was separated (when it was poured into a variety of glasses) is brought back into contact with the whole of itself, if only for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Etiquette mavens say one need not clink glasses with everyone present when participating in toasts among large assemblies. Rather than reach across vast expanses of wide tables (thereby risking losing your balance and ending up in the guacamole), simply raise your glass and make eye contact with the group.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;MY OWN THOUGHTS ON THE SUBJECT&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, with all this in mind, my own thought is that in times gone by as 'rivals' drank each others health, they would drink from the other person's cup (to avoid poisoning - however all one would have to do would be to poison one's own cup - surely that would have worked?!), as the cups were held to the other person's lips they would inadvertantly 'clink' together.  As time moved on and we attempted not to kill everyone in our paths the clinking just wort of became symbolic.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a fan of haggis and single-malt Scotch, and host of many a Rabbie Burns night, I'd say you have several good alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most of the Burns nights I've attended offered malty, full-bodied beers along with the haggis. Scottish ales, porters, wee heavies, and oatmeal stouts are some of the favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If there are wines, I'd recommend hearty reds, like a good Zinfandel.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that not all haggis is created equal. Just as no two Texans have the same family recipe for chili, no two Scots will make haggis the same. I've had haggis all over Scotland and quite a few places in the U.S., and each one is different. If you're getting it from a butcher that regularly makes haggis, ask for a taste in advance so you can ponder what to pair with it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE: Haggis in a can is an abomination.&lt;/strong&gt; Don't do it! Get fresh-made haggis from a proper butcher shop. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Having had (and enjoyed) Haggis many times, and I think it being closer to a red meat than a white meat, I'd say you'd want to pair it with alcohol that is typically served with red meat. Full bodied, medium to dry red wines, or darker bitter ales.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm not usually one to go 'by the book' with my pairings, but knowing what I know about the flavour and texture of haggis I think red wine or dark beer would be the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
