					&lt;p&gt;That is the difference. The distinction is purely one of size, and exists mainly for purposes of trade and legal organization. The gulf between the two wasn't always so large, but as the Boston Beer Company (Sam Adams) has grown, the standard for 'Craft Brewing' has been increased to allow for their continued categorization as a Craft Brewer. Even with the increases, the gulf in capacity between 'craft' and the various major macrobrewers is so large as to render the adjustments to the definition of 'craft' largely benign. The additional standards that a so called 'craft' brewery must restrict the use of cheap adjuncts in their grain bill keeps out the few smaller regional breweries that might otherwise fall under the umbrella. There's no 'craft' in making cheap alcohol water out of rice and corn. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The time it takes to make beer can be anywhere from 10 days to several months.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a few factors that determine how long a beer takes to be ready to drink.  The original gravity of the beer (gravity measure the amount of sugar in the wort), the type and strain of yeast used, and alcohol content of the finished beer.  Other factors such as any adjuncts used in the beer can affect this as well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For example, a low gravity, low alcohol ale using an efficient yeast strain can be ready to drink in as little as 10 days.  However a heavy lager beer can take 2-3 months to complete and some Belgian yeast strains can take several weeks to complete fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some beers go through additional conditioning post-fermentation before they are at their prime to drink.  This conditioning may include simple bottle conditioning or barrel-aging to impart different flavors.  There are some barrel-ages stout beers that have taken 18+ months to complete the process before the brewer feels they are ready to serve.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The most time?  I'd think Gueze.  It is a blend of 1 and 2 (and sometimes 3) year old lambic.  So the minimum time to produce would be 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In addition to what's said, a major caveat is sour beer.  Modern breweries have managed to coax and trick lagers into being ready without months of expensive aging, but there is no way to hurry a sour.  The bacteria and wild yeast strains that make those flavors require specific conditions, and changing those conditions changes the rates of their activity and the flavor of the beer.  Lambics in particular are often blended and contain "young" beer, which is only a year old, and "old" beer which can be 3 or 4 years, or more.  Then the beer is aged an additional year in the bottle, but can be kept for 10 years or more.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can certainly brew beer at home that is similar to a commercial recipe, but unlikely one that will pass for exactly the same thing.  First, the exact recipes are trade-secrets, and while you can guess at the quantities of ingredients, boil times, etc, you likely won't get them exactly the same.  Additionally, the ingredients you use aren't going to be exactly the same, and by far the biggest difference is likely to be in the water.  The mineral content in your water will be different from theirs, for instance, and this will have an effect on the flavor.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, brewing beer shouldn't be able slavishly replicating something you find on the store shelves...It should be about experimenting until you find the recipe that is perfect for your particular tastes. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's possible to make almost any beer at home; this hobby is known as Home Brewing and even has a Stack Exchange Community around the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most beer falls into two major categories: ales and lagers. Ales are easier to make at home because the beer can ferment at temperatures that do not require special equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Budweiser is a lager; lager beers require additional equipment to keep the beers fermenting at very specific low temperatures. So while it is certainly possible to make beers like Budweiser at home, few choose to do so because of the added expense and level of difficulty of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think the answer you are looking for is not so much seasonal as it is holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As you have your summer holiday in the middle of the year, it is the time when most alcohol is highest in demand.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The small spikes in your graph around December indicates the increase in production for new-year's parties.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As I am on the opposite side of the world, our peak production is the three months leading to December, for our Summer Holiday.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One thing you should take into consideration is that this chart certainly represents macro breweries production, once they still have the vast majority of the market-share, as opposite to craft breweries. So, we are talking here mainly about light lagers, known to be consumed as a refreshing beverage.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, to me, it's pretty clear that the production increases as the weather warms up, peaking at the summer, and then falls down again towards chiller seasons. Considering distribution and other delaying factors, the peak at June would match the peak consumption at mid-July through mid-August.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;PS: I don't live in USA, and this is merely a theory I came up with, but which seems feasible to me.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;No, this would destroy the wine/mash/beer that your were trying to remove the "head" from. Just to make the &lt;a href="https://www.clawhammersupply.com/blogs/moonshine-still-blog/12243869-making-moonshine-still-temperature" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;first pass&lt;/a&gt; in a still to remove this head, you would need to get the liquid up to around 200f to start the process, thereby destroying whatever your were trying to get the less desirable aspects out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are several factors at play here. If we think about how grapes were maintained hundreds or thousands of years ago, it was kind of a slapdash affair. In the beginning they probably just grabbed whatever grapes they could off a vine growing up a tree. Later they just haphazardly planted grapes in a field hoping for the best and they mixed everything, Red and white grapes and IF they got a harvest they were grateful. This style of grape growing does not lend itself to high sugar grapes. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This illustration below shows some middle ages grape growing in Burgundy. It's basically a hillside planted every few inches. No trellis or anything. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bx1Qk.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bx1Qk.jpg" alt="Pruning Grapes Middle Ages France"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Several things changed that equation, especially after WW2. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;New World grape growing. Growing grapes in the new world exploded after WW2 and continues to expand rapidly to this day. Why is this a problem? It is and it isn't. You have to remember grapes like Pinot Noir, Riesling, Cabernet, Grenache were probably grapes that had been domesticated over hundreds or thousands of years to adapt to the climate the original vines were from. Cabernet is a good example. The dreary coast in Bordeaux where the weather is not especially warm. In a good year, the grapes might make a 13% ABV wine. You take Cabernet and stick it in Napa Valley where it is MUCH warmer and sunnier and voila, you have 17% ABV monster cabs. IMHO, it's mostly too hot in Napa Valley to make a balanced wine. Same with much of Australia and South America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern Viticultural practices. Also after WW2 irrigation was introduced this enabled growers to grow wine in areas that were too dry to grow grapes without it. Washington State is a good example. The Yakima valley gets around 9 inches of rain a year, but the temperatures are within a range of growing grapes, if a little too hot and sunny. Now you have a region that looks nothing like where the grapes originally came from. This also pertains to just about everything about growing grapes today. Trellis systems, fungicides, rootstocks, soil management, canopy management. Everything is done with a high precision to eke out the most of the vines, resulting in wines that are super ripe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern Tastes - As our palates seek out more and more sweet things, many of these modern wines are made with higher alcohols on purpose because many times high octane wines come with a fair amount of residual sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because we can! In the new world we don't have the baggage that they do in Europe. We are allowed to pretty much do anything to our wines as long as it's legal and food grade. So, if you grapes accidentally got a few extra days in 100+ degree weather and started to turn to raisins and they are at 29 brix. You paid good money for those grapes and you can't waste them so you dump some acidulated water into your fermenter to water them down to acceptable levels and replace some acid that was lost because your grapes are over ripe. All perfectly legal in the New World, but absolutely verbotten in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brand name grapes - Everyone wants Cabernet and Chardonnay. Sure you can grow them in the Central Valley in California where it is super hot in the summer, but what type of wine do you get? Hardly recognizable from the original areas they came from, but the consumers just want to have these brand name grapes so we plant them in places of abundant heat having to water them down in the fermenter to make acceptable wines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I remember my viticulture teacher telling me that you should plant grapes that would ripen almost at the last possible day of the season. This would result in grapes that are in harmony with the local climate. What you see in many places like California where grapes are harvested in July and August and there is still MONTHS of hot weather ahead. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;All of this leads to a situation where many of the grapes we plant in the new world are simply not in the best climate for the best wine. 99% of the time it's grapes planted in a climate that's simply too hot. That's why we water our wines down.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think there are two ways to look at this. &lt;a href="https://www.whisky-news.com/En/reports/Labels.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Some distilleries do put the date&lt;/a&gt; when they bottled the whisky/scotch it will just take some leg work. Even cheap Old Turkey has a bottled date &lt;a href="https://whiskeyid.com/how-to-date-id-your-whiskey/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;stamped on the label&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Then the other way is to do some reverse math. There is such a thing as vintage whisky. Distilled and put into barrels in say 1990 and aged 25 years. So it would be bottled in the year 2015. Obviously you might have to wait until they bottle it the year someone is born. You can see some of this at the G&lt;a href="https://www.glenfiddich.com/us/collection/product-collection/rare-and-vintage/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;lenfiddich website&lt;/a&gt; (unfortunately they have an "are you old enough question" to get past). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The last option is to just buy a bottle of 20 year old whisky the year someone turns 20 (or whatever year you want) and just give it to them then when it's released by the distillery. Holding on to a bottle for 20 years or so can leave it vulnerable to all types of accidents. Don't risk it and just buy the bottle when they turn 21 or whatever age you want to bestow it upon them.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Just to extend farmersteves answer...There are quite a few that produce limited releases annually.  These tend to be limited releases produced either by a new brand or established distilleries but they are usually limited to smaller cask numbers.  As they are limited I would expect you to have to pay a bit more, many sell out quickly from shops so you may have to use an Online Auction.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The following auction is highly regarded and this search (simply for the year 2018) will contain many of this years release.  Note in these cases 2018 is the year it was bottled, the age determined by when the cask was put down.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.whiskyauctioneer.com/auction-search?terms=2018&amp;amp;dsp=Previous&amp;amp;show_page=20&amp;amp;sort_by=d_DESC&amp;amp;op=SEARCH&amp;amp;form_build_id=&amp;amp;form_id=auction_form" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="Whisky Auctioneer 2018 search"&gt;Whisky Auctioneer search for 2018 whiskies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Just yesterday MacAllan released one limited to a few hundred but very difficult to get and managed very poorly by them if I say so myself...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finally. I am also aware some distilleries let you buy casks to bottle at a later date, or alternatively buy a bottle from a yet to be bottled cask.  If you do it this year you could request the bottling at a specific milestone for your child (I know people who have done this).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I just looked at several of my bottles, and the only one having a date on the bottle was Ardbeg and it was stamped on the bottle not on the label.  You should look at smaller distilleries as they would use it as a marketing gimmick.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;An alternative would be to buy a bottle of Laphroaig which allows you to register a square foot plot of land at the distillery and get a certificate for it, which includes the date of registration.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you expand your horizons, many bourbon distilleries in the US either batch or date their bottles by hand.  Bean-ball Bourbon from Cooperstown does, others such as Hillrock give a batch number, and Hudson Valley also does batch numbers by hand.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've seen several scotches that are labeled "From the harvest of..." a particular year, if you want the birth year to correspond to the production year.  I got my kids vintage ports since they 1) age well nearly indefinitely if properly stored, and 2) everybody can tolerate a little glass of port even if they don't like alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
