					&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of ways to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The two main "approaches" are to extract the alcohol afterwards or just don't allow the generation of it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The extracting part can be achieved by filtering and reverse osmosis. Alcohol and water are getting sucked out and the "beer mass" gets re-watered. These steps may affect the taste quit a bit. A few brewers (especially in Germany) have developed a "top secret" technique to brew a alcohol free beer which tastes the same as "normal" beer - but most of these are "top secret".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Latest science experiements revealed a new way of brewing alcohol free beer, by just stopping the fermentation process. This can be done by lowering the temperature of the liquid containers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beers brewed with this technique tend to taste more sweet.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Both method have their up and downs so a couple brewers combined both: Less fermentation than usual and extracting the extra bits of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ales and lagers are brewed with different types of yeast.  Ale yeast ferments at the top of the brewing vat at a comfortable room temperature while lager yeast ferments at the bottom of the vat at a lower temperature.  The "low and slow" lager fermentation brings out more complex flavors.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ale yeast strains are best used at temperatures ranging from 10 to 25°C, though some strains will not actively ferment below 12°C (33). Ale yeasts are generally regarded as top-fermenting yeasts since they rise to the surface during fermentation, creating a very thick, rich yeast head. That is why the term "top-fermenting" is associated with ale yeasts. Fermentation by ale yeasts at these relatively warmer temperatures produces a beer high in esters, which many regard as a distinctive character of ale beers. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Top-fermenting yeasts are used for brewing ales, porters, stouts, Altbier, Kölsch, and wheat beers. *&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Lager yeast strains are best used at temperatures ranging from 7 to 15°C. At these temperatures, lager yeasts grow less rapidly than ale yeasts, and with less surface foam they tend to settle out to the bottom of the fermenter as fermentation nears completion. This is why they are often referred to as "bottom" yeasts. The final flavour of the beer will depend a great deal on the strain of lager yeast and the temperatures at which it was fermented. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some of the lager styles made from bottom-fermenting yeasts are Pilsners, Dortmunders, Märzen, Bocks, and American malt liquors.* &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It all depends on the beer really. Lagers are typically brewed longer than ales. Of the few brews I've made so far, I usually let them ferment for 2 weeks in the fermenter, then I bottle them and wait another 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The primary difference is the yeast used to ferment the beer -- ales use yeasts strains which work at a warmer temperature (10-25 deg C) than lager yeasts strains (7-15 deg C).  You may hear the terms "top-fermenting" for ale yeasts and "bottom-fermenting" for lagers, but I think that's more-or-less happen-stance -- the yeasts themselves are not inclined toward a particular altitude.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are two main ways to carbonate beer. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Force carbonation - This is where CO2 is forced into the fermented beer. Because of the pressure (and the temperature at which it is done) the CO2 will dissolve into the beer solution. The fizz that happens when you open a beer is the CO2 coming out of solution. (Technically you can re-carbonate flat beer!)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Natural carbonation - All beer has SOME yeast present. Home-brewers that bottle will actually pour a little bit of sugar into the racked beer before bottling. The yeast that is present will re-activate and eat the sugar. One of the bi-products is CO2. Because the beer is bottled and the CO2 has nowhere to go, it will dissolve into solution. This is why you will often see little yeast cakes in the bottom of home-brewer's bottles.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are some beers that used forced-nitrogen to nitrogenate (if that is the appropriate word) their beers. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - Temperature, methods of carbonating, storing beer can all affect carbonation. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some beer use animal by-products in their production.  Guinness is popular example: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isinglass"&gt;isinglass&lt;/a&gt;, a swim bladder, is as a filter or fining agent.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are two main ingredients in beer that might cause them to be unsuitable for vegans. The first one might be fairly obvious. Honey is sometimes used as a sweetener, especially in meade, but certainly in other beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, the main cause is a fining agent called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isinglass"&gt;Isinglass&lt;/a&gt; that is made from ground swim bladders of fish.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As you might expect, it's all got to do with the ingredients. I'm a vegetarian myself, but not a vegan. So I do eat honey and dairy. With that said, some beers would not be considered vegan if they use those ingredients (milk stouts for instance use lactose).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, an example of a non-vegetarian beer would be the oyster stout, which uses oysters in the brewing process. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer might be completely undrinkable if the water is poor quality. Usually it is ok to use your own tap water, but if it is softened, you'll want to buy bottled water, as the added sodium from the softener will ruin your beer. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I personally use purchased water from the grocery store. Usually 50% distilled, 50% "spring". Though honestly it's probably all tap water from somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most of beer is water, so it is vitally important.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here in Atlanta, we have some of the better tap water compared to many cities, but Monday Night Brewing in particular takes all minerals and chemicals out of the water and adds back in the appropriate properties to match the style of beer that they are trying to brew.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;They emulate the water from the origin of the beer style. Just consider that anything but the most pure form of water will impart some taste in your beer good or bad and is worth being aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Water is extremely important. When touring Brooklyn Brewery, the brewers went on and on about how great it is for them to have access to the NYC water supply.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;During brewing, the quality of the water is important because the minerals can affect a beer recipe greatly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I recently went on a tour of a microbrewery and had a conversation with a brewer afterwards. He said that their approach for reducing the alcohol content to legal "non-alcoholic" levels was to simply dilute regular beer with purified water.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It may be worth noting that the beer he was talking about was not designated for drinking, but for use in food production (beer-battered fish sticks, anyone?).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In general, such beers are made with grains that contain little or no gluten, such as buckwheat, sorghum, rice, or corn.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, this also means that cheap macrobrews such as Coors and Budweiser, which are often brewed with the cheapest of cheap adjuncts in their grain bills (such as corn and rice) end up being gluten-free (or very low gluten, legal definitions of the term vary) as well. Because the legal definition of 'gluten free' in many jurisdictions allows for very low quantities of gluten (generally less than 20 ppm), many gluten free beers include small quantities of rye malt for flavoring purposes. While some individual with celiac are able to tolerate these low levels of gluten (as are non-celiacs pursuing a gluten free diet for other reasons), tolerance can vary, so be careful when selecting a gluten free beer, and be aware that they can vary wildly, both in quality, and in gluten content. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These beers are made with non-gluten containing grains such as millet, rice, corn, or buckwheat as opposed to glutenous grains like rye, barley, or wheat. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a side note, I recommend your friend give &lt;a href="http://omissionbeer.com/"&gt;Omission Beer&lt;/a&gt; a try. I had it once on accident at a social event. I couldn't tell the difference between it and the real thing until I got home and looked it up online.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The reason there's a limit is once the alcohol content is too high, it kills the yeast, so fermentation stops and no more alcohol is produced. I think it's generally around 15% alcohol by volume, but the exact amount will depend on the type of yeast.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;EDIT: The Wikipedia page on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast_in_winemaking"&gt;yeast in winemaking&lt;/a&gt; has some details on when different types of yeasts die out.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That depends on what you mean by "naturally".  There are some strains, such as the &lt;a href="http://www.whitelabs.com/yeast/wlp099-super-high-gravity-ale-yeast"&gt;"Super High Gravity Ale Yeast"&lt;/a&gt; by WyLabs, which can handle up to 25%.  But there are techniques, such as freezing the beer to create a more concentrated product, which have been used to get up to 60+%.  In this case, alcohol is not &lt;em&gt;added&lt;/em&gt;, but rather, water is &lt;em&gt;removed&lt;/em&gt;, altering your ABV.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To do this, you should have a thermometer that you can throw into the water to measure the temperature, a pot for boiling water, and some bottles of beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Boil the water.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;When the water reaches 190 degrees Fahrenheit, turn off the water.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Carefully put the bottles into the pit.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Put the lid on the pot and wait about ten minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Carefully remove the bottles with a kitchen tong (or a mitten).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Put them on the counter to cool until they reach room temperature.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Refrigerate them.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Remember that the bottles are pressurized, so don't bang them while putting them in the pot, don't apply heat to the pot while the bottles are in there, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am taking this from a website cited at the bottom. Popsci has a LOT of cool beer articles. Fractional freezing is the best way to increase the alcohol content of beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Fractional freezing -- "jacking" in old parlance -- has a long history in the United States. The beverage applejack was produced using this method by first fermenting apple juice into hard apple cider. Then barrels of this cider were left outside during the winter and the connoisseur would occasionally fish out the frozen chunks of water, leaving an ever-concentrated batch of hard alcohol behind. At some point in the 20-25 percent ABV range, the liquor would stop freezing at ambient temperatures and the booze was ready to consume as "Jersey Lightning." It was also used as currency.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Moving into the malt-beverage world, brewers in Germany use fractional freezing to make eisbock. These brews are usually just regular bock beers, which clock in at 6 percent ABV, freeze-concentrated to something in the 13 percent ABV range. Frankly, there are probably easier ways to get high-proof beers (make a barleywine, for example) than by starting with a mid-strength one and concentrating it, but there's a market for eisbocks and it's possible to find them in the US as well. A more infamous set of freeze-concentrated beers was made by the Scottish brewery BrewDog in their quest to make "the strongest beer in the world." The first was Tactical Nuclear Penguin, a beer that started with an ABV in the teens and ended at 32 percent ABV. Then a little brewing war started up between BrewDog and German brewery Schorschbräu to make ever-stronger beers. Schorschbräu made a Schorschbock at 40 percent ABV, BrewDog countered with Sink the Bismarck at 41 percent ABV. Then came another beer at 55 percent ABV (that's 110 proof, my friends). Schorschbräu is current record-holder with Schorschbock 57, at 57 percent ABV.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Note that Ann Hagen ("Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink") argued that the strongest naturally brewed drinks available in Anglo-Saxon times were probably strongly brewed meads at least 20% abv.  Her basis is in discussions of specific gravity of the resulting beverages in historical records.  I think it is likely close to that and no more because I see other reasons to wonder if specific gravity could have been reduced by other additives (in particular henbane).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I love studying history.  It is useful in so many fields!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In general&lt;/strong&gt; getting much above 10-15%abv requires specialty yeasts or concentration techniques, and getting much above 20% is going to require some sort of concentration.  I have however seen cases where these rules go out the window in wine making experiments (a friend of mine accidently brewed a mango wine with 22% abv using standard wine yeasts, which surprised us both).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In addition to the answers given above, some specialty beers include animal products as well.  I have had beer made with oyster broth for example.  That one is definitely not vegan.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Interestingly in the Middle Ages, they used to brew with chicken broth sometimes, and some other times with dairy products (including either milk or whey).  That is worth remembering in terms of why some specialty beers include meat products as well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There was a &lt;a href="http://www.trollekelder.be/getapte-bieren-versus-bieren-uit-fles/"&gt;study about this&lt;/a&gt; which concluded that tapped beer can actually be better for different reasons (although taste is rather subjective). The reasons are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Beer on draught tends to have less air within the barrel compared to its bottled counterpart, meaning that the beer doesn't oxidise as quickly&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Beer within a barrel tends to remain cool for longer periods. A bottled beer cools and warms up a lot faster, which (when this occurs) has a nefast effect on the beer's taste&lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer is an alcoholic beverage produced by the saccharification of starch and fermentation of the resulting sugar. The starch and saccharification enzymes are often derived from malted cereal grains, most commonly malted barley and malted wheat.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It can be influinced and is often influenced during the brewing process, by adding sugar (which gets transformed into alcohol) at certain phases during the brewing process. Several beers first get brewn on a barrel and then after a few weeks put onto a bottle after which sugar may be added. Adding the sugar causes a seconds fermentation which will result in a higher alcohol level. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Often deeper tastes as experienced with for instance a La Trappe, Rocherfort 10 or Westvleteren are the effect of the higher alcohol level. While alcohol certainly plays a role in the beer's taste, spices and herbs are also important for the beer's taste body.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Doppelbock (or double bock) is intense in its maltiness and higher than "single" bock in terms of alcohol content, typically starting around 6-7% and going up to around 13%.  There isn't anything specifically doubled or tripled; rather, &lt;em&gt;doppel&lt;/em&gt; idiomatically refers to be being "bigger"/stronger than a standard bock.  In terms of how higher "maltiness" is accomplished, that would depend on the specific beer; mashing at high temperatures, reducing lautering, using certain grains or different yeasts, and other factors all can increase the maltiness of the final product.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A triple bock would just be a naming convention emphasizing even further the maltiness and alcoholic strength of the brew.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As an aside, doppelbocks are an evolution of strong monastic brews used as "liquid bread" for fasting monks, as they were not allowed to consume solid food.  These sweet, malty beers evolved over time into the modern doppelbock.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is no correlation between boil time and ABV.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The increased ABV stems from them adding more malt to balance out the extreme bitterness for the beers with longer boil times.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, it's important to note that the boil time is not the only thing that increases with each of those beers.  Dogfish Head continually hops during the boil, and the boil extracts the alpha acids from the hops, giving the beer bitterness, so a longer boil with more hops results in a wort that is more bitter. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is where the additional alcohol comes in:  To counteract the extra bitterness, the beers that have boiled longer have both additional malt added to balance the bitterness, and are given additional fermentation and conditioning time to allow the yeast to convert all of those malt sugars into alcohol.  In 120 Minute IPA's case, it spends an entire month in fermentation, resulting in an exceptionally high level of alcohol at the end.    &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a note on the boil process and ABV.  Boiling effectively stops the process of converting starches into sugars which the yeast can turn into alcohol by destroying enzymes in the malt.  Therefore once you are boiling, this process has stopped.  Boiling affects hops, by boiling off the aroma and extracting more of the organic acids that provide bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What does affect abv is the period of time the wort is kept warm before boiling.  This time and temperature affects how much of the starches convert and therefore trades between body and abv.  Boiling fast means you have a lot of body and low alcohol.  Boiling later means you have more abv and a lot less body.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The calories in beer come mainly from the alcohol and the carbohydrates in the beer. By reducing either or both of these, the beer will become lighter. As well as being lighter in calories, light beers are typically lighter in taste also.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Alcohol is reduced by starting with a lower amount of sugar in the wort (lower OG.) By fermenting less sugar, less alcohol is produced. The carbohydrates in beer are so-called residual sugars. These are reduced by reducing the amount of non-fermentable sugars, such as by adjusting the recipe to avoid malts that contain unfermentable sugars (such as Cara/Crystal malts, and highly kilned malts). Also the brewer can adjust the temperature that the grains are mashed to produce a more fermentable wort with less residual sugar.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To see how alcohol and carbs affect the calories in beer, here's an excerpt from &lt;a href="http://www.beer100.com/beercalories.htm"&gt;this table&lt;/a&gt; that lists the % abv, grams of carbohydrates in a 12.oz serving:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Name        Brewer          abv     cal.    carbohydrates
					Busch Ice   Anheuser Busch  5.9%    169 12.5g     
					Busch Light Anheuser Busch  4.1%    95  3.2g
					&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The light beer has considerably less calories than the regular beer. In fact, around 80% of the calories in that beer come from the alcohol:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1 g of alcohol = 7 kcal. 

					1 g of carbohydrate = 4 kcal.

					Volume of beer is 12oz. x 28.6g = 343ml.  Volume of alcohol is 4.1 % x
					343 = 14 ml

					To convert alcohol volume to weight, divide by 1.25. Weight of alcohol
					is 14 / 1.25 = 11.2g 
					&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Energy from alcohol is 11.2 x 7 = 78.4 kcal. As percent: 78.4/95 =
					  &lt;strong&gt;82%&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Energy from carbs is 3.2 x 4 = 12.8. As percent: 12.8/95 = &lt;strong&gt;13%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;(The total is less than 100% - the data doesn't account for protein, which is typically about 1g/12oz, which is about 4 kcal.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;By brewing the beer with an even lower %abv, the beer would be even lighter in calories, but possibly at the expense of flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That is the difference. The distinction is purely one of size, and exists mainly for purposes of trade and legal organization. The gulf between the two wasn't always so large, but as the Boston Beer Company (Sam Adams) has grown, the standard for 'Craft Brewing' has been increased to allow for their continued categorization as a Craft Brewer. Even with the increases, the gulf in capacity between 'craft' and the various major macrobrewers is so large as to render the adjustments to the definition of 'craft' largely benign. The additional standards that a so called 'craft' brewery must restrict the use of cheap adjuncts in their grain bill keeps out the few smaller regional breweries that might otherwise fall under the umbrella. There's no 'craft' in making cheap alcohol water out of rice and corn. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ok, so the basic brewing process is this (not homebrewing detail here, just a distant overview):&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Heat your wort with water, steep, then add hops and boil, add more hops as you begin to cool, once cool enough add yeast, ferment, bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Flavored beers can be made a bunch of different ways. You can add herbs, spices, or flavorings before or after the boil, for example.  Seeds and roots would usually be added before the boil; herbs would usually be added after.  I would probably add fruit after but this is something that folks could argue about forever.  If you buy something like smoke-flavored beer, chili flavored beer, etc. these are probably made this way.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There's a second type of flavored beer I have seen for sale in certain bars and restaurants in Asia though.  That's where you take a fairly light beer on tap and add it to a glass along with a shot of flavoring syrup (like lychee or peach).  These usually have sweeter flavor with clearer fruit flavors than the fermented fruit beers.  If the beer is pasteurized, the flavoring could be added before bottling and carbonation.  I think that is what you are seeing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Just a fun fact: Some consider if you add something other than hops, malt, water and yeast to beer, it is no longer technically a beer according to German purity law. What you have is a malt beverage. (You can see this in the small print on malt beverages such as SweetWater Blue for example)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EO4n4.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EO4n4.jpg" alt="Sweet Water Brewing Company"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_Oki6Tg0i_EI/TYyqe8EuEwI/AAAAAAAAIJ0/QsTaOXPlfXc/post1_thumb%5B6%5D.jpg%3Fimgmax%3D800" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Sweet Water Brewing Company Label&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Edit: (This is controversial and certainly not enforced)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are tons of flavors you can impart based on the types of hops and malts you use and when you add them in the brewing process.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When boiling the wort, you can add hops to impart flavor midway through the process. If you add them at the beginning, you get bitterness primarily from the hops. If you add them at the end, you get primarily aroma from the hops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is common practice to add hops in all 3 stages for those reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There's also a lot of flavor that you can add to the beer by aging it in barrels. It is common to use barrels from whiskey or bourbon for this purpose among craft brewers. This can add a huge punch of flavor in some beers. (This may be happening on in the Rogue beer you linked to)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Rogue Voodoo Doughnut Maple Bacon Ale is an interesting example because the ingredients list shows two different ways flavors can be imparted to beer.  The smoky bacon flavor comes both from the actual inclusion of bacon and from the smoked malt: &lt;em&gt;Briess Cherrywood Smoked Malt, Weyermann Beechwood Smoked Malt, House-smoked Hickory Malt&lt;/em&gt;.  As discussed in &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/53/does-chocolate-stout-contain-real-chocolate/65#65"&gt;Does chocolate stout contain real chocolate?&lt;/a&gt;, certain flavors can be achieved through the malting process rather than through additional ingredients.  Similarly maple is fermentable and could be added directly to boost alcohol content and impart a more subtle maple flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, this beer does contain actual bacon and "maple flavor".  To get a look at and when and how the flavors are added, we can look at &lt;a href="http://www.brewtoad.com/recipes/inspired-by-rogue-voodoo-doughnut-maple-bacon-ale" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this clone recipe&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Name              Amount     Time        Use
					Fenugreek         0.25 oz    5.0 min     Boil
					Maple Extract     1.0 oz     6.0 days    Primary
					Bacon, cooked     4.0 oz     0.0 days    Bottle
					&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here, fenugreek is added during the boil phase, while creating the wort.  The boiling helps extract the flavor from the herb.  Maple extract gets added later during fermentation.  Maple extract or syrup could be used, but syrup is more expensive and fermentable so a stronger maple flavor is being achieved with extract.  The official ingredient list calls for "Pure Maple Flavoring" so I assume the same is being done there.  Lastly the bacon is being added at the end.  This is to add direct flavoring to the beer without interfering in the fermentation process.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;li&gt;Beer  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Mead  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Cider  &lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;LIGHT LAGER  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;PILSNER  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;EUROPEAN AMBER LAGER  &lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;li&gt;ENGLISH BROWN ALE  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;PORTER  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;STOUT  &lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;li&gt;GERMAN WHEAT AND RYE BEER  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;BELGIAN AND FRENCH ALE  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;SOUR ALE  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;BELGIAN STRONG ALE  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;STRONG ALE  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;FRUIT BEER  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;SPICE / HERB / VEGETABLE BEER  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;SMOKE-FLAVORED AND WOOD-AGED BEER  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;SPECIALTY BEER  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think winning an award at any sanctioned competition would be huge. I do see the World Beer Awards, the US Open Beer Championships, Great American Beer Festival, and North American Beer Awards, just to name a few. There are also Homebrewing awards that are very competitive. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some types of hops have interesting flavors. For example, simcoe hops has a pine-y, fruity taste. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some interesting beer ideas would be pine, rosemary, or cardamom (I've had one - it was amazing). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, some white beers (like Hoegaarden) have coriander and citrus peel. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A black lager, or perhaps a schwarzbier, really is a lager.  Aside from the difference in the fermentation process, there will be some difference in your base ingredients, as a schwarzbier will focus less on the chocolates or coffee flavor of a stout.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I suspect you may find significantly more information in homebrew.stackexchange.com, as hunse suggests.  We would love to go into all sorts of detail over there!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a number of distilled spirits that are made from the same grains that are used to make beer, so could be considered to be "distilled beer".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The most obvious one is whisky, which can be made using various grains including including barley, malted barley, rye, malted rye, wheat, buckwheat and corn.&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;  Whiskys don't generally include hops though, so you wouldn't use a random beer as a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Vodka can also be made from grain, but the production process removes most of what you'd consider to be "beer".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, most beer judging is based on how well the beer represents the style category that it is entered into. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These aspects of the beer are evaluated to see if they match with what is expected for the style:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;appearance: color / foam / clarity&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;aroma: malt / hop / yeast / esters&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;mouthfeel: body / carbonation&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;flavor: lots here - see below&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;aftertaste: flavors and aromas that persist after the beer is swallowed&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;overall impression: drinkability &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;All of these are evaluated with respect to what is expected for the style, and points assigned. The beer may be perfectly drinkable, but be marked down because it doesn't fit with the style. For example, a hefeweizen that is dark would be lose points for appearance since they are light-colored beers by style.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Judging sheets often have a list of flavor descriptors. Some flavors are bad for any beer, such as rubber, astringent, soapy, while others may or may not be considered faults depending upon style. For example, fruitiness in an English Ale is much desired, but not in a Pilsner, similarly low levels of diacetyl in a Stout is acceptable, but not in a Hefeweizen.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/docs/SCP_BeerScoreSheet.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;BJCP Scoresheet&lt;/a&gt; provides a working example of the notes a beer judge&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The first part of the picture depicts the description in my answer about where the yeast "works," the temperatures at which they work, and then some common types of ales/lagers. The second picture shows S. cerevisiae (common ale yeast) and a wild yeast S. eubayanus making some new cold tolerant yeast strain babies that are the common lager yeast (S. pastorianus). Note: my biology is rusty but from my reading and looking at the picture, this is what I derived. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The time it takes to make beer can be anywhere from 10 days to several months.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a few factors that determine how long a beer takes to be ready to drink.  The original gravity of the beer (gravity measure the amount of sugar in the wort), the type and strain of yeast used, and alcohol content of the finished beer.  Other factors such as any adjuncts used in the beer can affect this as well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For example, a low gravity, low alcohol ale using an efficient yeast strain can be ready to drink in as little as 10 days.  However a heavy lager beer can take 2-3 months to complete and some Belgian yeast strains can take several weeks to complete fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some beers go through additional conditioning post-fermentation before they are at their prime to drink.  This conditioning may include simple bottle conditioning or barrel-aging to impart different flavors.  There are some barrel-ages stout beers that have taken 18+ months to complete the process before the brewer feels they are ready to serve.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The most time?  I'd think Gueze.  It is a blend of 1 and 2 (and sometimes 3) year old lambic.  So the minimum time to produce would be 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In addition to what's said, a major caveat is sour beer.  Modern breweries have managed to coax and trick lagers into being ready without months of expensive aging, but there is no way to hurry a sour.  The bacteria and wild yeast strains that make those flavors require specific conditions, and changing those conditions changes the rates of their activity and the flavor of the beer.  Lambics in particular are often blended and contain "young" beer, which is only a year old, and "old" beer which can be 3 or 4 years, or more.  Then the beer is aged an additional year in the bottle, but can be kept for 10 years or more.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There may be a general consensus for the "proper" serving temperature, which could involve questions like "what do &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; people seem to like?", and "what temperature does the brewer feel best accentuates the parts of the beer they want to highlight?".  So there are good reasons for beer to be served at particular temperatures.  In the case of your British bitters, age-old recipes were probably designed to allow the beer to taste its best at room temperature.  As for a modern British beer, I suppose that would depend on what the brewer had in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, my general thought is that you should drink a beer at the temperature you most like it, so the &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; part of your question is self-determined, and don't let anyone tell you that your taste buds are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Myself, I tend to like my American IPAs cooler than the typical recommended serving temperature.  And before I visited the UK, I couldn't stand a room temperature beer.  Then, after a week in Tunbridge Wells, I picked up a large appreciation for hand-pumped UK beer, served at room temp.  So you should open yourself to trying new things as well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Serving temperature is, of course, a preference.  Serve it frozen or boiling if you want.  However, a few opinions are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.camra.org.uk/beerinthepub" rel="nofollow"&gt;CAMRA says&lt;/a&gt; that Real Ale (aka cask ale, usually english-style) should be served at 12-14 °C (54-57 °F), which is colder than room temperature, but warmer than your usually keg beer.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/Story.asp?StoryID=479" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ratebeer says&lt;/a&gt; the same thing regardless of whether it’s cask or not.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/style/98/" rel="nofollow"&gt;BeerAdvocate says&lt;/a&gt; 7-10 °C (45-50 °F) for an english bitter.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, if you’re looking for a rule of thumb: “cool but not super-cold” or “cellar temp” will probably get you close enough.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The German Beer Purity Law, also know as the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinheitsgebot"&gt;Reinheitsgebot&lt;/a&gt;, dictates what ingredients may be used to create beer in Germany: barley, hops, and water.  It dates back to 1487, which is why you may notice the omission of &lt;em&gt;yeast&lt;/em&gt;: it hadn't been recognized as an ingredient yet.  The law was removed from the books in 1993, and replaced by another similar law which allowed yeast, sugar, and some of the more common brewing ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the case of a US brewery making such a claim, it's a sort of advertisement toward the "purity" of their product, i.e., they don't use adjuncts (rice, etc) or other flavorings (fruit, spices) in their beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The purity law has been introduced to regulate the production of beer in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire" rel="nofollow"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The original text stipulated that the only ingredients that could be used in the production of beer were water, barley and hops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The "Reinheitsgebot" has actually survived the Holy Roman Empire. Many German brewers are proud of this heritage and claim to stick to it. It's relevance today is commercial. It's used as a label for marketing reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In addition to what's been said, the original purpose of the order was to protect consumers from brewers who used problematic (toxic/psychoactive) herbs to preserve their beer, instead forcing them to use hops.  Also only using barley allowed wheat and rye to be used exclusively by bakers to keep the cost of bread down.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One could argue the tradition has kept German brewers from innovating, and also keeps a lot of interesting styles out of reach.  Most Belgian-style beers, despite having a similar heritage to German styles, will include candi sugar and spices like anise and coriander.  Technically, sour beers are also out.  Also, a lot of the Trappist ales will use sugar adjuncts.  Today, it's mostly a statement of adherence to tradition, which can carry good marketing weight.  But this is beer, not marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, let's say there is what is considered "proper", and then there is personal-preference. To be a good Cicerone, know what is "proper" but also show tolerance for personal preference.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With that out the way, it's definitely considered the "proper" thing to do to serve English beers warmer than ice-cold. Many of the delicate malty flavours you get from English malt, the fruitiness from esters produced by the English yeast, plus grassy, herbal or floral tones from the hops are muted greatly when the beer is served too cold. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some people say it's served at room room temperature. Modern room temperature of around 20&amp;deg;C/68&amp;deg;F is too warm. The ideal serving temperature is a cold cellar - typically around 12&amp;deg;C;55&amp;deg;F. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Just like everyone else said, it's a preference. I alway say that the darker the beer, the warmer it has to be, so here are my rules:&lt;br&gt;
					- &lt;strong&gt;Light beer/White beer/Kriek&lt;/strong&gt;: In the fridge and goes in the freezer for a couple of minutes before serving&lt;br&gt;
					- &lt;strong&gt;Golden beer&lt;/strong&gt;: In the fridge&lt;br&gt;
					- &lt;strong&gt;Amber beer&lt;/strong&gt;: In the fridge and stay at room temperature for a couple of minutes before serving&lt;br&gt;
					- &lt;strong&gt;Dark beer&lt;/strong&gt;: At room temperature and goes in the fridge before serving&lt;br&gt;
					- &lt;strong&gt;Stout&lt;/strong&gt;: At room temperature at all time.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1603420894" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tasting Beer&lt;/a&gt; by Randy Mosher is by far the most valuable beer book I've ever read.  It covers the styles you'll encounter, the flavors, the technology, the history, the science, and more.  I was a fairly knowledgeable beer enthusiast when I read it, but I wish I'd read it ten years earlier.  If I had, it would have increased my enjoyment of getting to know beer ten-fold by increasing my  understanding of what I was drinking.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bacon Beer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've heard of beers made with rauchmalt - smoked malt, where the brewer has "&lt;a href="http://byo.com/stories/issue/item/569-dry-hopping-techniques"&gt;dry hopped&lt;/a&gt;" with bacon or bacon flavored soya to give the beer a bacon flavor and aroma - allowing the bacon and the smoked malt to enhance each other. One commercial example is &lt;a href="https://rogue.com/beers/voodoo-bacon-maple.php"&gt;Bacon Maple Ale&lt;/a&gt; from Rogue, which features a variety of smoked malts (over different woods) plus applewood smoked bacon.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cock Ale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071209115313AAbFnmq"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a recipe for ale made with chicken broth:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;PERIOD: England, 17th century | SOURCE: The Closet Of the Eminently
					  Learned Sir Kenelme Digby Kt. Opened, 1677 | CLASS: Authentic &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;DESCRIPTION: A drink of ale, chicken broth, &amp;amp; sack &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;To make Cock-Ale. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Take eight gallons of Ale, take a Cock and boil him well; then take
					  four pounds of Raisins of the Sun well stoned, two or three Nutmegs,
					  three or four flakes of Mace, half a pound of Dates; beat these all in
					  a Mortar, and put to them two quarts of the best Sack: and when the
					  Ale hath done working, put these in, and stop it close six or seven
					  days, and then bottle it, and a month after you may drink it.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And PS: the Guinness meat story because of finding rats in the fermentation tanks or barrels is a myth. Or to put it another way, even if it did ever did happen once, it's not practiced now. It's hard enough for bacteria to get into the fermentation tanks or barrels, let alone something as big as a rat! (Nowadays they use stainless or aluminum kegs.) &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another example is &lt;strong&gt;oyster stout&lt;/strong&gt;.  While some breweries today use the name for beers that don't contain oysters, it was originally brewed with oysters.  It seems that the style grew out of the popular food pairing of stout and oysters, leading to attempts to combine the two, starting in New Zealand in 1929.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One example of a modern brewery using oysters is &lt;a href="http://www.porterhousebrewco.com/beers-oyster.php"&gt;Porterhouse Brewing Company in Ireland&lt;/a&gt;.  More information on the style can be found in &lt;a href="http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000740.html"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A recent release by an Icelandic brewery actually contains whale meat, and inevitably this has been quite controversial!

					&lt;p&gt;I'd like to try it myself but it's not for export and the only way I could afford to get to Iceland anytime soon would be canoe. Seems a bit chilly out for that, though.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Guinness, in common with some other beers, does actually involve a meat product in the brewing process, specifically the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isinglass"&gt;swim bladders of fish&lt;/a&gt;. This substance is not nominally retained in the final beverage.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Oyster stout traditionally uses oysters as part of the brewing process, and that is the flavour that differentiates them from other stouts.  While it is traditional to use oysters, some modern breweries use artifical flavours in their oyster stouts, or simply say that they are intended to be eaten with seafood.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You mention Marston's Oyster Stout, which is one example of an oyster stout that doesn't use actual oysters in the brew.  From &lt;a href="https://www.classicales.co.uk/Products/Marstons_Oyster_Stout/48"&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Marston’s Oyster Stout is a dark, creamy, smooth, clean tasting English stout. It doesn’t contain oysters, just called Oyster Stout as this style of ale is a great complement to shell fish dishes.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's important enough that many British brewers modify the composition of their water to more closely mimic the mineral content of water drawn from wells near &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burton_upon_Trent" rel="nofollow"&gt;Burton upon Trent&lt;/a&gt;, where traditional styles are considered to originate from. This process is called &lt;em&gt;Burtonisation&lt;/em&gt;. I've noticed for my part that some traditional bitters I've drunk have had a noticeable and not entirely pleasant aroma somewhat like old eggs, which I would guess is the sulphur content that is added in this process. I don't particularly care for beers that taste like this, but each to their own.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Water is the primary ingredient in beer.  In my opinion, the water quality is more important than anything else.  I believe in drinking beer for health, and as I don't drink dirty municipal water, why would I drink beer from it?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Just think about city water from a second.  Much of it comes from the same river that the sewage is dumped in.  Just because the stink has been taken out of it with carbon filters, does that make it tasty to you?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, I don't believe in drinking sodium fluoride.  No rat poison in my beer, thank you.  I don't care how many people say that it's in there for your smile.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When I buy commercial beer, my primary criteria is the water.  If it is fluoridated, no thanks.  If it is spring water, super thanks!  Spring water is natural and it has natural minerals built in.  Also, you will notice that the finest beers have spring water.  See BFM of Switzerland and Samuel Smith of England.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Short answer; you get a lot of the flavour from the yeast, you can get a fairly big difference by varying the yeast in your recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For example, a Saison and a Pale ale have similar ingredients, but taste quite different, a Saison yeast imparts a considerable amount of flavour... likewise if you use a lager yeast, and properly lager your beer, you can get a different flavour again, without modifying any other part of your recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Lots of discussion on HomeBrewTalk forums, and other places. For a fun experiment, brew split batches and try two different yeasts to compare!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Belgian Lambics are probably the most notable beers brewed with wild yeast. They are fermented in open vats, and wild yeast strains specific to the area contribute a very distinctive flavor to these beers. Lindeman's is probably the best known commerical example in the US, although these beers are sweetened and are not usually considered a true example of the style. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are strains of wild yeast that have been cultivated for commercial use such as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brettanomyces"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brettanomyces&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Breweries use this yeast to produce sour flavors via lactic acid production. Brewers will use it both in primary fermentation, and by aging their beer in barrels that have been "infected" with it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/110/what-is-the-highest-alcohol-content-achievable-through-brewing?rq=1"&gt;This might be a duplicate question&lt;/a&gt;, but since as far as I know beer uses fermentation and no distillation, I expect the maximum alcohol level to be around the same maximum as for wine, which I believe is &lt;a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090518144252AA2xvY1" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;somewhere around the 13% to 15% level (by volume) as this is the level around which micro organisms seem to die&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I know some beers in the 10% to 12% range, like the Dutch &lt;a href="http://www.biernet.nl/bier/merken/grolsch-kanon" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;het Kanon ("the canon") by Grolsch&lt;/a&gt; at 11.6% and &lt;a href="http://www.biernet.nl/bier/merken/hertog-jan-grand-prestige" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Grand Prestige by Hertog Jan&lt;/a&gt; at 10%, both of which I like. They have a bit of a sweet caramel-like flavour, but I'm not sure if that related to the amount of alcohol in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am not sure about this but as it occurs to me, through the years these abbey breweries got larger and get operated with more efficiency and more modern equipment (I guess!!).
					What I do know however: Chimay is one of the largest Trappist brewers so it's not that weird that it's widely available. With hundreds (thousands!) of beers in Belgium, Chimay is a popular beer, but far from the most popular. I think that's the reason why they can sell a lot abroad.
					Also a fact, beers like Westvleteren (that won a lot of prizes) are even in Belgium (where it is brewed) pretty rare and hard to get. Basically you have to go to the Abbey yourself to get some beer. If you're there, you only get ONE crate (6 beers) per person. I was lucky enough to visit Westvleteren a while ago and found out that in the nearby cafe you also could buy one crate per person, however there were only about 100 crates available that day and only one type was available. You can drink all types though by ordering it to drink in the café (3 types).
					If you would ever want to taste Westvleteren but cannot find it, Sint-Bernardus Abt 12 is a very similar beer. I've heard that it is brewn exactly the same way but with some slight differences.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There has been a bit of a battle recently, with Brewdog and Schorschbräu constantly topping each other's efforts: &lt;a href="http://www.brewdog.com/blog-article/the-battle-to-brew-the-worlds-strongest-ever-beer" rel="nofollow"&gt;BrewDog Blog.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Currently it's a &lt;strong&gt;Schorschbräu Schorschbock 57% finis coronat opus, which comes in at 57.7%&lt;/strong&gt;, beating Brewdog's latest effort: &lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/schorschbrau-schorschbock-57-finis-coronat-opus/154245/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Schorschbräu Schorschbock 57% finis coronat opus.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'd say the strongest commercially viable option &lt;em&gt;(these 50% beers only ever have a few bottles in the batch and cost a silly amount)&lt;/em&gt; in the UK anyway, is &lt;strong&gt;Watt Dickie&lt;/strong&gt;, also by Brewdog, which comes in at &lt;strong&gt;35.0%&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.brewdog.com/product/watt-dickie" rel="nofollow"&gt;BrewDog UK.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I suppose it depends on how one defines beer. Following the German Reinheitsgebot, beer may contain only 4 ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Water&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Yeast&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Hops&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Barly malt&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beverages which do not adhere to these restrictions may not be labeled as beer in Germany, and several other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To my knowlege, the strongest beer of kind is &lt;a href="http://www.benz-weltweit.de/derbraeuvomberch/index2.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Schorschbock 57&lt;/a&gt;, an ice-distilled doppelbock with 57,5% alcohol content.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It depends on your definition, commercially available is Kwak, around the same as wine, if you go to the Grand Place it comes in those horse &amp;amp; cart designed bulbous glasses (like a mini yard of ale). Once you go above that the others are all pretty specialist.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimay_Brewery" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wikipedia's article&lt;/a&gt; leads to several sources that substantiate what @ValentinGregoire preempted. For example, Chimay put up &lt;a href="http://www.chimay.com/en/art-of-brewing.html?IDC=284" rel="nofollow"&gt;a series of short video clips&lt;/a&gt; that take us through surprisingly up-to-date facilities capable of bottling up to 40,000 bottles a day! (Probably it's just my own prejudices—associating monks and monasteries with old times, thus old technologies—causing surprise in my case.) With many other competing beers, and demand checked by relatively higher prices, the abbey alone suffices.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The volume produced, according to &lt;a href="http://marketsmedia.com/chimay-turns-150-week-manchester-pub-nyc-celebrates/" rel="nofollow"&gt;this 2012 article&lt;/a&gt;, is 120,000 hectoliters of beer annually, or 16,000,000 bottles (750 mL) of beer. To put this in some perspective, according to &lt;a href="http://celebrator.com/archives/2007/12/gh_belgianbeer.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;this 2008 article&lt;/a&gt; St. Bernardus at the time was exporting to 20 countries and producing 13,000 hectoliters (considerably lesser than Chimay) annually. And as @ValentinGregoire started saying, Westvleteren is difficult to find because the monks of the abbey of Saint Sixtus decided not to increase production despite the beer's popularity, and thus produce only 4,800 hectoliters according to a 2005 publication.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For me, it's hard to grasp such large numbers in any meaningful way. I looked up Stella Artois' production figures (and not because it's Belgian—it was just the first popular, global beer to come to mind), and found that in 2012 they produced a little over 10,000,000 hectoliters that year. Divide that by Chimay's 120,000 hectoliters per annum. Can I believe that 83 units of Stella are being consumed for every 1 equivalent unit of Chimay? Meant only as a sanity check and not any rigorous argument, it checks out as believable to me—after all, Stella's on draught all over the U.S. (I can't speak for other countries but I'm sure everywhere else too).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is whole style of beer, which is made with honey. It is made by adding honey to the wort during or before fermentation. Thanks to addition of honey in early stages you get balanced, homogeneous taste. Nothing to add that honey will ferment along with malt.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Technically you can add anything to beer when it is ready (including honey), but then you get this aggressive flavor on top.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Stan Hieronymus, the author of "Brew Like a Monk" has some info on his website (from 2006) about production numbers from various Monasteries:&lt;/p&gt;

					Achel        2,000 HL   2               17      1
					Chimay       120,000 HL 82              20      0  
					Orval        45,000 HL  32              16      0
					Rochefort    18,000 HL  15              17      6
					Westmalle    120,000 HL 41              20      0
					Westvleteren 4,750 HL   10              28      7
					&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Stan also mentions in Ep 37 of &lt;a href="http://beersmith.com/blog/2012/04/30/brewing-like-a-monk-with-stan-hieronymous-beersmith-podcast-37/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Beersmith Radio&lt;/a&gt; that some of these Monasteries own their own bottling plants and production facilities.  I can't remember which one, but one of the Abbey's facility that they operate out of is owned by Heineken, but operated by the monks.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I disagree: boil time &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; affect ABV.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Assuming you're not trapping the steam, most of what boils off is water, meaning your final wort will have a higher O.G. In general, that will result in a smaller quantity of a higher ABV beer. (Of course, there are many variables, such as your yeast, your fermentation time, your ratio of fermentable:unfermentable sugars, and so on.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, the starch-&gt;sugar conversion is generally terminated by your sparge (that being one of its purposes), so how fast you get to your boil doesn't have much of an impact.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Peated malt can provide a beer with subtle smokiness. Peated malt is malt that has been smoked over peat (decaying vegetation). This is common in Scotch &amp;amp; Whisky Ales.

					&lt;p&gt;To add a bit of detail to the existing answers, the primary method for adding a smoked flavor to beer is by using malts that have been dried over a smoky fire, rather than in a kiln which allows the malt to absorb compounds from the smoke that they then release into the beer during brewing.  Some of the oldest smoked beers still produced are German (Rauchbiers) and the malt is dried over &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rauchbier#Bamberg_Rauchbier"&gt;beechwood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Other woods can be used, and you can find malt smoked over oak, cherrywood, and any number of other species.  As mentioned in another answer, peat can be used as well and in fact is for &lt;a href="http://www.stonebrewing.com/porter/"&gt;Stone's Smoked Porter&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another method for adding a smoky flavor is to use &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_smoke"&gt;liquid smoke extract&lt;/a&gt;. This is made my cooling and condensing smoke with water, and can be used instead of smoked malt.  I'm not aware of commercial brewers who use this method, but it's a way for home brewers who use malt extract instead of dried malt to add smokiness to their beers. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One other potential source of smoke flavors is actually the yeast.  Some yeast produce phenolic compounds during fermentation that produce smoke flavors and aromas.  Scottish yeast strains in particular are known for this.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One source of smokiness unmentioned as of yet is vinvyl-guaiacol production from bacteria metabolism.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The answers already given are more relevant, however there is one important source that has been unmentioned. Although more common in distilling, lactobacillus and other strains of bacteria can attribute flavor to fermentation products. Different strains induce a different, possibly harmful, effect. Focusing on lactobacillus, which is your common bacteria used in cheese making, lactobacillus can introduce more lactic acid into the beer. This anaerobic bacteria is more active either before fermentation has started (either by contamination or inoculation) and after fermentation has ended. More so after fermentation this bacteria has metabolize the autolysis products of yeast. The acids from this bacteria later form into vinvyl-guaiacol, a flavor compound that lends a spicy and smokey note.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Mead is an entirely different product which tastes more like a wine than a beer but is quite distinct from either in terms of taste, designation and production. I have never come across a mead flavoured with hops but some are flavoured with other botanicals such as spices or orange peel  so I cannot guarantee that none are.
					Most beer breweries undertake a more complex brewing process involving adding ingredients to the mash at different stages and as such, knowing a few hundred UK brewers as I do, they are all about getting the complex mixture correct and blending ingredients correctly they are disinterested in the simple mead making process. That said the mead making process; adding honey to water, adding yeast and letting it ferment may be boring to them it doesn't mean that none do, &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; I have never known any to be interested.
					On the other hand some wineries in the UK have their own beehives to help pollinate their fruit and so they produce mead as a side product. This may also be true in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A quick search bears out my thoughts on wineries in the US: &lt;a href="http://www.stormthecastle.com/mead/where-to-buy-mead.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Where to buy Mead&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Mead is not considered a style of beer, since the sugars in mead come from honey, not from the starch of a grain. Hops are sometimes added to mead for flavor and as a preservative.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The process for making mead is more similar to wine making than brewing beer. There's no brewing (boiling) stage necessary in making mead. All of the fermentable sugar comes from the honey in mead, so you just mix honey with water (and whatever spices you want) and go directly to the fermenting stage. Mead also has a higher alcohol content than most beers (8 - 20%, which is more similar to wine, or even brandy).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;...would it be reasonable to think a brewery I like may make, or consider making mead as well?&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not really. At least not in the U.S. Beer is much more popular than mead, and the process for making mead is different, so relatively few brewers are going to make it. I tried mead once at a specialty beer &amp;amp; wine store, which is your best bet for finding it in the U.S. You may have to ask around to see if a store can order some for you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In addition to what was already said, there's a lot of legal gray area, as most if not all states have different laws governing breweries and wineries.  Mead is really something different than both, but I believe most meaderies choose to identify as wineries, and many if not all states prohibit wineries from having malt on premises, and breweries MUST use malt in fermentation.  You'd either need to find someone that has a license for both beer and wine, which probably isn't that common in commercial operations (brewpubs may be your best bet there), or look for someone who makes a braggot, which is generally a beer/mead blend.  Dogfish Head makes Bitches' Brew, and Sprecher Brewery just released a braggot this year.  If you're looking to buy, wine shops are generally a better bet - again, lots of people don't know exactly what to do with mead, but I've had good luck finding it, usually around the dessert wines, sherry, port type of wines.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some&lt;/strong&gt; Gluten Free beers actually have gluten at the moment they are made, for example in the case of Omission the beer goes trough a proprietary "gluten removal process" and then they use a gluten test called the Competitive R5 ELISA, which is used to test foods that are "hydrolyzed," or broken down. This test looks for a specific lengthy fragment of the gluten protein and returns a negative result if it doesn't finds it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the test results are under 20 parts per million (as @LessPop_MoreFizz's answer says), then it can be called "gluten free" in the USA... and yes, I've heard people with serious celiac disease can still "feel" that concentrations and get sick.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"Estrella Damm Daura" on the other hand has only 3 parts per million, they also have a proprietary process to remove gluten. Estrella Damm Daura is an European beer made in Spain, obviously in Europe health and food standards are way better than USA's. In Europe, food authorities will never allow a brewery to call a beer with 20 ppm "gluten free". Just don't confuse it with "Estrella Damm" which is their regular beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The main difference between the two is the different types of yeast that they both use. Lager yeasts are more tolerant to cold temperatures and so are fermented at a lower temperature. This is what gives the lager a crisp flavour. The ale yeasts ferment at higher temperatures and take less time to complete as the yeast is more active the higher the temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Both types also use very different hops and malts...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Along with Marty's reccommendation of Pumpking, Southern Tier also makes an Imperial Pumpkin Stout called &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/3818/99558/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;. Best Pumpkin beers I've had so far ( Warlock &gt; Pumpking imo ).&lt;/p&gt;

					  &lt;p&gt;"Pump Up the Volume   A blast of pumpkin pie aroma introduces you to this full-bodied and fairly malty beer.

					&lt;p&gt;Just to add to this topic, I think it's important that the correct terminology is used since a number of answers contain false information.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the beer world, "gluten free" can only be used if the ingredients used to brew the beer do not contain gluten. Sorghum appears to be the most popular ingredient for making GF beers, but there are a number of other options including buckwheat, millet, honey, even chestnuts. Redbridge is an example of a GF beer. I have yet to taste a GF beer that I enjoyed as sorghum specifically gives off a cider-y flavor and all the beers end up thin.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are also beers that are brewed with traditional ingredients that contain gluten, but an enzyme called Brewer's Clarex is added to primary fermentation. Clarex was originally used to clear beer and prevent chill haze, but it was discovered it also breaks down gluten such that, when tested with traditional gluten tests (ELISA), the beer is well within the "gluten free" threshold (&amp;lt;20 ppm). These beers cannot be called "gluten free", though, rather they can only be labeled "crafted to remove gluten". Omission brews "gluten reduced" beer (which are very good IMO), but apparently Yards also uses Clarex in some of their beers (even though they don't label their beer as "crafted to reduce gluten").&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If it is an Oyster stout then it probably should have contact with ACTUAL oysters. Using the shells is a cop out that is like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Soup" rel="nofollow"&gt;stone soup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Checkout new brewery Hammertown in London who do it properly:
					"In 1938 the original &lt;a href="http://www.hammertonbrewery.co.uk/our-beers/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Hammerton Brewery&lt;/a&gt; was famous for being the first in the world to use Oysters as part of the brewing process. In this new recipe we’ve used a variety of flavoursome malts, including a good dose of oats. Fresh wild Maldon oysters are then added to the boil to add a subtle extra complexity to the taste of this stout."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If everything has been sealed tightly, it should all be good still. The grain is probably fine, check that it's dry and still hard before using it, and inspect carefully for weevils or other small bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Dry extract is good for at least 6 months if sealed and dry. Sift it and see how clumpy it's gotten- if it's been good and dry, it won't have many clumps, and you can still use it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Liquid extract is fine for at least a year if it's sealed. Check the top of it for mold.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are many schools of thought on hops going bad- personally, I'd buy new ones. Also buy new yeast, or at least get it started a couple days ahead of time and make sure it's nice and alive.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If everything is reasonably cool and dry, no problem, but it would be a better if the hops and yeast had been kept in a refrigerator. You might have lost a little hop flavor, or the ferment might take a bit longer&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Remember that barley and hops are only harvested in one season - does AB stop brewing every spring while waiting for the next harvest?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A few bugs on the grain isn't so bad (been there, brewed that) but mold is bad news, will actually screw up your beer (apparently some of the mold's enzymes will survive the boil and keep digesting your beer).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Dry yeast is supposed to be OK for 1 year at room temp, but it will stay viable for quite long time if sealed. That stuff is hard to kill completely.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as the extracts go, I've never heard of them going bad, as long as dry is dry and liquid is not diluted. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Best of luck!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;yes, not really and yes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's quite popular to add flavors, especially spices, after
					fermentation. The ideal method is to make extract of the spice, try
					it in a sample of the finished beer, and add the right amount to get
					the flavor level you want. Adding it during fermentation makes the
					end result harder to predict (especially if the CO2 scrubs out
					volatile flavor compounds) but it is not uncommon to dry hop while
					the beer is near the end of fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only special thing to do on brew day is make sure the beer style is suitable for the spice that you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For barleywine some people will continue to add fermentables over a long time, apparently it keeps the yeast happier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ideally you'd want to add flavors in the secondary fermentation stage (aka placing your fermented beer in a brightening tank). After your primary fermentation happens, you'd rack the beer into another clean container and let it set for longer. This would allow any of the remaining sediment to fall out of solution and make your beer less cloudy.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is a very common time to do things like "Dry hopping." Where, in addition to adding hops in the wort-making-stage... You take (as sterile as you can get them): hops; spices; fruit; or whatever you feel like adding - place them in a sterile cheese-cloth if they would get messy/float - and then let the new mixture set until you're ready to bottle/keg. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;@Pepi is correct. Since you cannot "clean" a cinnamon stick, it is common practice is to make a spice extract and place it into the beer, a little at a time, until you achieve the appropriate flavor. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You probably can add something &lt;em&gt;during&lt;/em&gt; the primary fermentation; but, the chances that it would cause issues with the fermentation become much greater. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Could I add in like orange extract or something along those lines in order to get a citrus flavor in the beer?&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes; search Google for "secondary fermentation additions".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Is there anything I can do or should that have happened when I was boiling the wort in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are flavor additions you can throw in the kettle but you'll get the most bang for your buck with (SANITIZED!) additions during fermentation. Don't think twice about an amber ale, though; wait until you have some more experience before improvising with recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;would it be possible to raise the alcohol percentage of the beer/ make it stronger in this stage&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Again, yes and no. In theory you can add more cane sugar, but in practice it only works with yeast that are highly alcohol tolerant. (Usually Belgian; highly alcohol tolerant yeast strains usually make no secret about their properties.) The yeast used for an amber ale is most likely not tolerant enough to go very far outside the recipe, and beer that is &lt;em&gt;too alcoholic&lt;/em&gt; for the recipe generally tastes pretty bad.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;AB claims it is. In reference to it being brewed in the US,&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Chris Cools, the head of the German branch of the company, says he's confident that Becks will lose none of its German character. He believes the beer's taste will be enough to ensure success. Becks is brewed according to Germany's Beer Purity Law, the Reinheitsgebot, that dates back hundreds of years and is made in exactly the same way in 15 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The classic, strict interpretation of the law would require only barley to be used as a grain. There are more lax standards currently, revised as the &lt;a href="http://archiv.jura.uni-saarland.de/BGBl/TEIL1/1993/19931400.1.HTML" rel="nofollow"&gt;Provisional German Beer Law&lt;/a&gt; (in German), but by using the name of Reinheitsgebot, it's safe to assume they are intending to convey the original restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can certainly brew beer at home that is similar to a commercial recipe, but unlikely one that will pass for exactly the same thing.  First, the exact recipes are trade-secrets, and while you can guess at the quantities of ingredients, boil times, etc, you likely won't get them exactly the same.  Additionally, the ingredients you use aren't going to be exactly the same, and by far the biggest difference is likely to be in the water.  The mineral content in your water will be different from theirs, for instance, and this will have an effect on the flavor.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, brewing beer shouldn't be able slavishly replicating something you find on the store shelves...It should be about experimenting until you find the recipe that is perfect for your particular tastes. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Reduced alcoholic beer has been developed by using an advanced development of the process known as vacuum distillation at low temperature (which is the most traditional and is less aggressive of any alcohol extraction methods), by using this sophisticated process the beer doesn't suffer any temperature or pressure aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's possible to make almost any beer at home; this hobby is known as Home Brewing and even has a Stack Exchange Community around the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most beer falls into two major categories: ales and lagers. Ales are easier to make at home because the beer can ferment at temperatures that do not require special equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Budweiser is a lager; lager beers require additional equipment to keep the beers fermenting at very specific low temperatures. So while it is certainly possible to make beers like Budweiser at home, few choose to do so because of the added expense and level of difficulty of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's just marketing.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Lager fermentations are very clean so it tends to be a beer you want to drink in a warm and humid climate.  The breweries want to make beer that will sell very well locally, and that just happens to be lagers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;At a commercial scale brewers are investing in temperature control regardless of ale or lager, so it's not a significant expense or savings one way or another.  So since they're spending the money anyway, might as well brew what people will buy more of.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From the consumer perspective, it's cheaper to buy from a local company than it is to buy an imported beer in most cases.  So the local beer sells better than the import.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Lagers tend to be more popular as they taste better colder, and are 'easier drinking' than heavier, more flavourful beers, and taste good very cold or with ice, so better for quenching thirst in the heat.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, stouts and darker heavier beers are often popular in rural areas in tropical Asia where ice is unavailable - think &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/727/5551/" rel="nofollow"&gt;ABC Extra Stout&lt;/a&gt;, Beer Laos Dark, Guinness Foreign Extra Stout, or &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1885/12773/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Black Panther&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have personally drunk beer that was unintentionally sour, and smelled like a sewer, without a problem.* &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If it has alcohol, and a low-ish pH (was made from reasonable water, barley and hops) then it is, according to history, safe. Many contaminating bacteria will produce acetic or lactic acids under these conditions, but they are also safe to drink.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you really screw things up, (forget to add yeast, drop  dead mouse in there) maybe its possible to grow some listeria or something, but you'd probably find the smell to be intolerable.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Typical beer infections will produce various levels bad flavors along with some scum on top of the bottled beer (since yeast produce bubbles and foam when working, this scum might not be visible until the yeast are completely finished, usually after the beer has been bottled). Some kinds of bacteria will also give a ropey (snotty) texture to the beer, but even this is safe to drink. &lt;a href="http://www.howtobrew.com/section4/chapter21-2.html"&gt;This page&lt;/a&gt; lists common beer off-flavors, note that danger isn't discussed, because there really isn't any.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And if you contaminant is a wild yeast, the beer might turn out OK (or even great) after a long aging, despite initially smelling horrible. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;*Not a beer that I made&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The basic rule is that beers should be served at the temp they were fermented. Lagers should be served at about 40°F and ales around 50°F - 55°F.  Having said this I usually like my beers a little colder on a warm summer day. Try this experiment:  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;chill your beer to 35°F - 40°F and pour about 2/3 of it into the proper glass for that beer. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Drink at least 4 or 5 sips, gulps, or however you typically consume it. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Then put what is left in the microwave for about 20 seconds (time will vary with the output of the microwave).  This will reduce the carbonation some so pour the other third right in the middle of the glass without tipping the glass to get some head, on the beer that is. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It makes a big difference on some beers. less on others. Also try different types of glasses and see what you like. Remember, everybody's palates are different and yours will vary depending on several factors such as, what you've been eating or drinking, how much beer you've already consumed, and how tired you are. It's a good idea to eat a bite or two of good bread like a baguette to cleanse your palate between samples. The above does not apply to mass produced lagers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's always going to be a matter of preference. I prefer most beers around 55-60 but do not hesitate to drink beer at room temperature. Some styles are more enjoyable approaching room temperature. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Historically, most beer was served at cellar temperature to room temperature, depending upon what was available. That isn't just an English tradition. Any beer can be consumed warm and drinking it ice cold as mass produced lagers are usually served tends to hide most of the flavor that you are paying for in a good beer. Give it a try and see what you like. Maybe you don't like your beer a little warmer. Enjoy what you like.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Oysters used to be served as an accompaniment to beer in pubs in Victorian England, so the first beers called Oyster Stouts were probably beers intended to compliment oysters rather than containing them. Later someone discovered that you could use crushed Oyster shells as a fining agent in beer and later still someone actually added the oyster meat, probably as a marketing gimmick since oysters aren't going to add much to the flavour.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So it's fine for oyster stout to not contain oysters.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Well, people at the craft beer industry just doesn't have limits, so, guess what? They are doing primary fermentation with Brettanomyces for many styles, including popular ones, like IPAs (look for brett ipa on Google). I don't know very specific details about the strains used for it, but I do know there are a few ones in the market right know. Probably some of them are more suitable for it than other ones.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, Brett doesn't take longer than any ale yeast to ferment (primarily), and gives a slightly different aroma and taste profile, but nothing funky like it does in secondary fermentation/maturation, which is that slow process you probably have heard of, when it eats complex sugars and other compounds, ending up with that barnyard aroma. &lt;strong&gt;And contrary to what many people think, it doesn't acidify the beer (brett produces only a small amount of acid, not enough to sour it). When people want to brew sours, they use bacteria.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Actually, at a glance, 100% brett beers aren't so different from beers fermented with Saccharomyces. Off course, this is completely different from adding brett to the bootle and letting it to develop over time.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Why brewers are doing it? A guess they ask the exact opposite: you should we not do this? =)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Effectively, yes.  A sour beer is what we'd consider to be a spoiled beer.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a quick primer, "wort" is turned into "beer" when microbes convert the sugars in the liquid into alcohol, CO2, and ...other stuff.  Generally speaking, we use brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces Cerevisiae for ale or Sacc. Pastorianus for lager) because the other stuff tastes pretty nice, or at least doesn't taste bad.  Various strains of the same organism produce different byproducts, an example would be an English ale yeast which is well known for compounds that are kindof sweet or fruity vs Belgian ale yeasts which are well known for being peppery, clovy, or banana-y.  Those flavors all come from the yeast used for fermentation, but it's only ever a single strain of yeast, which was isolated in a lab.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sour beers are basically defined by not using a single isolated, clean-tasting strain of Saccharomyces.  The most common sour yeast used is in a genus called Brettanomyces, which depending on the specific species can produce flavors like...horse saddle, bandaid, cheese, cloves, and vinegar.  But most sour beers are not strictly brewed with yeasts like Sacc. or Brett. but also have bacteria in them.  Most commonly lactobacillus and pediococcus which are known for producing large amounts of lactic acid, which is where the sour really comes from.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That's not to say sour beer brewers are being sloppy, because their "infections" aren't accidents.  They're deliberately trying to use less predictable and slow-acting organisms to create consistent beer.  That's tough.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As to a suggestion?  I like Tart of Darkness by The Bruery.  Petrus is good stuff and Duchesse de Bourgogne is nice.  Occasionally it's nice to find a really tart Berlinerweisse and mix it with a fruit syrup and Gose can be incredible paired with cheese.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sourness may have been, in a higher or lower level, a common characteristic of beers centuries ago, specially after some time of storage, once the common vessel to keep it was wooden barrels, and wood often harbor a lot of microorganisms, including bacteria and wild yeast, the former being responsible for souring the beer. After the Industrial Revolution, with more hygiene and sterile tools, that characteristic became more and more uncommon, and at some point, undesirable. So, meanwhile, yeast was "discovered", isolated, and fermentation controlled so that we had a clean taste profile, free from acids at all, which is what you know as beer nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Don't be fooled: &lt;strong&gt;what really sours a beer are bacteria, not &lt;em&gt;Brettanomyces&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The later, also known as 'wild yeast', are usually found in sour beers as well, but are responsible for other aromas and flavors (barnyard and horse saddle being the most recognizable). (&lt;em&gt;Brett&lt;/em&gt; actually produces a tiny amount of acid, no more than that).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some Belgians have been intentionally making sour beers for centuries, through spontaneous fermentation process (in the case of &lt;em&gt;lambics&lt;/em&gt;) and wood-aging (in large oak vats) after "clean" fermentation (in the case of &lt;em&gt;flanders reds&lt;/em&gt;). Germans did it too, but their two traditional sour styles (&lt;em&gt;gose&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;berliner weisse&lt;/em&gt;) are almost dead there, and differ from the belgians ones on the absence of &lt;em&gt;brett&lt;/em&gt; character.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, nowadays people comprehend a lot better how those processes occur, and are doing sours again on purpose and manipulating those organisms in many ways. Basically, souring bacteria used are &lt;em&gt;pediococcus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; (not very different from &lt;em&gt;lambics&lt;/em&gt;, actually). Most of the time, barrels are still used in the process, because of the micro-aeration those microorganisms need. And, off course, for keeping the microflora inside it, etc, etc, not to mention the flavor complexity that comes from wood compounds itself.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A contaminated beer may end up being a sour. Well, so what distinguish a spoiled beer from a sour? Nothing actually, except that when people intentionally want to produce a sour, they do that with some more control in order to get the outcome they want and not some weird aleatory taste at the end. But, at some level, producing a sour beer, specially when using barrels, is always unpredictable too.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it's a rich and complex topic, probably the most exciting one about brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As suggestions, I definitely encourage you to taste the classic ones, belgian lambics (any &lt;em&gt;Gueuze&lt;/em&gt; you find) and flanders reds (have you ever heard about &lt;em&gt;Rodenbach&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Duchesse de Bourgogne&lt;/em&gt;? they're amazing). I love &lt;em&gt;Petrus Aged Pale&lt;/em&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And, if you are from US, then you are bloody blessed, because american craft brewers are doing sour/wild beers like there were no tomorrow. =P Look for &lt;em&gt;Allagash&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Russian River&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Lost Abbey&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Bruery&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Avery&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Boulevard&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Almanac&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Deschutes&lt;/em&gt;. The list is infinite. The thing is getting so serious that in the last years, all-sour breweries are popping up, like &lt;em&gt;Rare Barrel&lt;/em&gt; from Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Well, technically, single malt (scotch whisky) is a distilled beer, except for not having hops in it. They even call it beer before distilling and the brewing process is pretty much the same (again, except for the hops), although it doesn't go through secondary maturation. Off course, they keep the recipe very simple, on most cases probably using a single type of base malt and nothing else. No special/flavouring malts like beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But some people nowadays are doing crazy things like &lt;strong&gt;distilling real and well-known beers into whisky&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Look at those guys of &lt;a href="http://www.sevenstillsofsf.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Seven Stills&lt;/a&gt;, from San Francisco, and &lt;a href="http://www.solspirits.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sons of Liberty&lt;/a&gt;. They're are making whisky (pretty much single malts if you stop to think) from Imperial IPAs and Chocolate Stouts. &lt;a href="http://www.purspirits.com/products_beer.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Those guys from Germany&lt;/a&gt; are distilling their classic Marzen style too. Rogue, a brewery in the first place, distill some of their beers as well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are even some well-know craft beers which have already been distilled into whiskys, like &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2012/06/17/new-whiskey-will-made-from-sam-adams-beer/z9hxDImhtlunnErE46PzdI/story.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Samuel Adams' Boston Lager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some people go even further: they distill a barrel-aged beer and age the resultant spirit again in the same barrel which the beer came from. Not to mention that sometimes they age their regular spirits in "beers barrels" as well. Confused? Me too. =)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Interesting time we are living nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some breweries use a hop "Torpedo", where the beer is forced through a chamber containing the desired aroma hops:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://byo.com/hops/item/1899-torpedoes-away" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://byo.com/hops/item/1899-torpedoes-away&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Oyster stouts are indeed brewed with oysters. The occasional offering that we sell (Niagara College Teaching Brewery), uses oysters at the end of the mash regime (hot soaking of the grains). The idea here is that you are extracting calcium carbonate from the shells, which helps reduce the tannic astringency that can result from the roasted grains used in stouts. This is the same reason/benefit that stouts are traditionally brewed in areas with relatively hard water. It also happens to be the perfect temperature for cooking oysters. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Oysters cooked or uncooked could be added at other parts of the process, but may not have the same impact on reducing astringency. There is a subtle undertone of the oyster that makes it into the finished product, but your palate may vary and may or may not detect it (depending on process and quantity used). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a South African homebrewer I can happily report that it is legal to brew in South Africa. We have no legal limitation on what/how much we may brew. The only rule is: DO NOT SELL!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a few homebrew shops around, Beerguevera, brewmart, black kilt, etc. Google should help you find a good one close by.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ask your questions on homebrew.stackexchange.com&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For a active SA Brewing forum: wortsandall.co.za&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is a home brew club in most provinces. On wortandall you can find one close to you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Better get brewing fast! The Nationals are starting soon! :D&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question one&lt;/strong&gt;: how does bottled beer differ from draught beer?
					This varies from beer to beer, and should be handled on a beer-to-beer basis. Sometimes beer in the bottle is pasteurized, while the keg is not. Sometimes one or the other is filtered, while the other is not. The gas content can also differ, since this is adjustable in draught systems but not with bottles.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In some cases, such as when yeast content is very important for the flavor profile of a beer, like German Hefeweizen, how much yeast you get in your glass has a big impact on the drinking experience. When drinking from the bottle, you can make sure that you get all of the yeast from the bottom of the bottle into your glass by agitating the last few ounces of beer, but this isn't possible with a keg. 
					Kegged versions of these beers still have yeast in them, but you're not getting that perfect ratio in every glass. In my two years as a beer enthusiast living in Germany, these beers are almost always served from the bottle, and every bar or bartender has their preferred method for getting all the yeast out of a bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question two&lt;/strong&gt;: What is done to bottled beer to prolong its shelf life?
					This also differs from beer to beer. Some imports are pasteurized in the bottle, some others, namely MillerCoors products, use proprietary hop derivatives like Tetrahop to keep hop flavor while minimizing hop oils' susceptibility to producing off-flavors due to light exposure. This isn't a bad or unnatural thing, and I hope this becomes more widespread, because skunked, lightstruck beer is awful. (see &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/2010/12/03/131785456/Searching-For-Science-In-A-Glass-of-Beer" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt;) This, however, is also present in kegged beer, as it has other beneficial properties like increased head retention.
					Sometimes, though, nothing is done beyond packaging, like Sierra Nevada's transition from twist-off to pry-off caps a few years ago to combat leaking, infection, and oxidation. &lt;a href="http://brookstonbeerbulletin.com/sierra-nevadas-new-pry-off-cap/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Brookston Beer Blog 2007&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question three&lt;/strong&gt;: Why is draught so much better?
					Very, very subjective, and you may want to clarify or qualify this in the future. Is good draught beer better than old, skunked bottled beer? Yes. Is good bottled beer better than flat draught beer poured through dirty lines? Also yes. Each has its pros and cons when it comes to service and storage.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would venture to say that much of draught beer's appeal comes from it being special- you typically have to go somewhere else to get it in a way that's not usually available to the home user, like how the theater experience differs from the home movie experience. Yes, you can get bottled beer in bars, too, but it's still a more "normal" format. In terms of taste over experience, though, I don't know that you could say for sure without some sort of blind tasting with lots of variables (age, glass type, line cleanliness, CO2 pressure) controlled for. Even then, what does it for the tasters might not do it for you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For further reading on all that goes into draught beer, check out the &lt;a href="http://www.draughtquality.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/DQM_Full_Final.pdf" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Draught Beer Quality Manual&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"premium verum" is just a marketing-joke. Warsteiner is a real "Pilsener".

					&lt;p&gt;That's a very broad question, and hard to answer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Very early on, hops weren't well known, and beer was made without hops; this likely would have caused the beer to be sweeter than it is today. Hops were known and added to beer relatively early in the Middle Ages, though.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Today, in my opinion, the key differences are variety and technology. Not only do we have a greater variety in styles, but we have more varieties of hops, malts, and different yeasts. These create wildly different flavor profiles unheard of centuries ago. Technology has allowed us to create more consistency in beers, as well as increasing variety indirectly through different techniques used in brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here's a pretty nice article on the history of beer: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_beer" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_beer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And if you want to try some beers brewed in traditional styles, they are out there. Here's a good list of some of the best: &lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beerstyles/traditional-ale/59/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.ratebeer.com/beerstyles/traditional-ale/59/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not only has variety improved, but so has the technology and agronomy of brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Malt variety, yield, and efficiency&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Crop science has increased the size of barley kernels and the amount of starches available to convert to sugar.  The common grain at the time was 6-row malt, today the most &lt;a href="http://www.homebrewersassociation.org/zymurgy/zymurgy-extra-2-row-vs-6-row-barley/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;common brewing barley is 2-row&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Understanding of the malting process has drastically improved. Today we understand how to &lt;a href="http://www.brewery.org/brewery/library/Malt.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;get perfectly malted barley&lt;/a&gt;. Historically the malt would have been over or under modified.  Under modified would have lots of unconverted starch which would leave a hazy beer that tasted rather bready. Over modified malt would would have no starch, but less sugar than possible so the resulting beer may lack body.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Kiln dryers allow for greater variety of malt. By controlling the heat cycle, the same variety of &lt;a href="http://hbd.org/brewery/library/Malt_AK0996.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;barley can make different malt&lt;/a&gt;.  Drying the grain in medieval times consisted of heating it over a fire.  Fire dried grains would have a smokey flavor that would be present in the beer.  The traditional Scottish Ale uses malt that has been dried over a fire where the fuel is peat, which is a very distinct smoke flavor.  The fire also was not nearly as exact or even as a modern kiln so some kernels would be burnt and other may be under cooked, so to speak. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Water&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Needless to say, but water purity is drastcally better today than in the 6th-15th centuries.  Because the brewing process boils the water, the beer was safer to drink than the water. Hence the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_of_Soissons" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;patron saint of brewers&lt;/a&gt; said "Drink beer, not water."&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Dissolved mineral content of water and pH control.  Medieval brewers had the water that they had.  Today, a brewer can start with distilled water and add whatever minerals they desire to change the flavor profile and pH of the mash.  The water pH can effect the mash efficiency and fermentation profile of the beer.  This lack of water control lead to specific styles coming from specific areas. I.E. Burton upon Trent is known for pale ales, Pilsen for golden pilsners, Munich for malty lagers.&lt;a href="http://howtobrew.com/book/section-3/understanding-the-mash-ph/balancing-the-malts-and-minerals" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Some water source mineral content.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Hops&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Ancient beers were not hoppy. Hops were not used extensively in beer until about the 12th century and were not cultivated en mass until about the &lt;a href="http://www.britishhops.org.uk/history-of-hops/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;13th century&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/a/4643/4637"&gt;Most beers older than that were bittered with Gruit.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The hops that were used were not high in bittering acids.  The oldest common hop varieties are the &lt;a href="http://beersmith.com/blog/2012/02/05/noble-hops-for-european-beer-styles/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Noble hops&lt;/a&gt;.  Just like today, costs of ingredients was a major factor in brewing.  Making a really hoppy beer was prohibitively expensive.  Just compare an English IPA brewed from old recipes vs. an American IPA.   &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Yeast and Microbiology&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;This is where modern technology really helps out.  Louis Pasteur discovered yeast in 1857. Up until that time, the changing of sugar into alcohol was considered magic or an act of god.  It was understood that the foam on top of a fermenting wort could be passed around to other vats of wort to start the process (&lt;a href="http://www.homebrewersassociation.org/how-to-brew/exploring-the-german-technique-of-krausening/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Krausening&lt;/a&gt;). Others would transfer &lt;a href="http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000103.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Magic Sticks&lt;/a&gt; from batch to batch to start fermentation.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;There are other microorganisms that can inhabit beer. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brettanomyces_bruxellensis" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Brettanomyces&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediococcus" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Pediococcus&lt;/a&gt; to name a few.  These can cause a sour, acidic flavor in beer.  Some ancient breweries would just let the cold night air in through an open window in order to cool the freshly boiled wort, exposing the warm sugar solution to whatever might land on it.  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Technology&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Thermometers - The temperature of the mash can affect the fermentabilty of the wort. The temperature of the malting and drying affect the sugar content of malted barley.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Chemical cleaners - All of the brewing equipment is sanitary. Modern living through chemistry.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Food storage/availability - I can get whatever ingredients I want, whenever I need them.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Refrigeration - I can cool the wort in controlled conditions. Beer can travel farther. I can ferment at optimal yeast temperature.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;More than can possibly be named...&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;h1&gt;The Result?&lt;/h1&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Ancient beers would be sweeter and thicker than today's thanks to less fermentable sugars in the wort due to inconsistencies in the brewing process, and inconsistencies in the malting process and poor yeast/microorganism control.  The alcohol content would be lower as well.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Ancient beers would not be hoppy.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Ancient beers would have to be drunk quickly before they spoiled.  The other bugs in the beer would turn the beer bad after a few weeks.  This also prevented the beer from traveling very from from the brewery.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Ancient beers could vary greatly, batch to batch.  The brewers of the times were very skilled with what they could work with, but they were constrained by what ingredients they could use, whether by law or availability.  Flavor can be affected by fermentation temperature, so a hot day in December could ruin my beer.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Ancient beers were dependent on the season. When was the grain harvested? When is it cool enough to ferment?&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Probably more information than you need, but hopefully it helps.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Generally - yes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A large part of the flavour of the beer comes from esters produced by the yeast during fermentation.  There are many different varieties of yeast, and each has a differing set of esters it produces.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The problem arises in that as temperatures increase the yeast ferments and grows much more rapidly, and can produce different and/or too many esters, in addition to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusel_alcohol" rel="noreferrer"&gt;fusel alcohols&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most packs of brewer's ale yeasts will have a temperature range on the back, say something like 18-25°C{1}.  However, unless one is brewing a beer style that warrants it (like a "Saison") the general rule is to keep the beer fermenting below 20°C.  Ideally, 18-19°C is best.  (You don't want to go too low either, at &amp;lt; 15°C, ale yeast may go dormant - but that's another answer.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, what can you do?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Brew only in winter.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Find a spot in your house, a cave, whatever that maintains this temperature.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immerse your fermenter in a larger vessel of water:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Find a vessel significantly larger than your fermenter.  Bathtub, laundry sink, plastic barrel, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Put your fermenter inside this, fill the space with water.  Drape a cloth, towel, t-shirt, over the fermenter such that it wicks-up the water.  This cools by evaporation.  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Add blocks of ice a few times a day, as necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modify an old freezer (or 'fridge) with a temperature controller:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;A device like an STC-1000 allows one to simply set the temperature wanted inside the 'fridge and it monitors and adjusts the temperature by turning the electricity on and off.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Some variants of these have the controller mounted in a box with a pair of domestic sockets, so the 'fridge doesn't need to be modified, just plugged in. (the temperature probe still has to go inside though).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I personally brew in a hot climate (some Autumn &amp;amp; Spring, and most Summer days are &gt; 30°C), and have used all these methods with varying levels of success.  They are ordered from least-successful to most-successful.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;{1} Just because the yeast pack says it's OK at 25°C, doesn't mean it produces &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; beer at this temperature.  I expect some people will disagree with me on this. Ultimately it's a matter of preference, and I think keeping fermentation temperatures &amp;lt; 20°C is good advice for a beginner.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some beer styles are less sensitive to temp than others, strong ales or hefeweizens would do better than lagers for example. In my opinion, if you are serious about brewing you want consistency. To achieve consistency you need a temp controlled storage. Get an old freezer or fridge and a kit from ebay/amazon and you can maintain 70F on the cheap... &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"Bottom fermentation" is one of the two main types of fermentation which take place during beer production; the other being "top fermentation". A third less common type would be spontaneous fermentation (a natural beer fermentation process taking place in the wild). Typically, only one fermentation process occurs during production (either bottom, top, or spontaneous fermentation). It basically describes what happens to the yeast during fermentation- some yeast float to the top of the liquid during fermentation, while some types of yeast sink to the bottom. Which type of fermentation takes place, depends on the type of yeast used in the process. So to answer your question, if it effects the type of drink (and taste), the answer is yes. It's not so much whether the yeast sink to the bottom or float to the top that affects the taste/style, but it is rather due to the type of yeast which determines what will happen to during fermentation (float to top/sink to bottom). For instance, lager strains of yeast typically float to the bottom. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From Beeradvocate.com: 
					"Some of the lager styles made from bottom-fermenting yeasts are Pilsners, Dortmunders, Märzen, Bocks, and American malt liquors."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"Top-fermenting yeasts are used for brewing ales, porters, stouts, Altbier, Kölsch, and wheat beers."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A more in-depth summary can be seen at the &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/101/yeast/"&gt;Beer Advocate's Yeast Guide.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This, "The idea here is that you are extracting calcium carbonate from the shells, which helps reduce the tannic astringency that can result from the roasted grains used in stouts." from John, was most helpful and logical. Understanding how chemistry functions in brewing becomes logical once you ponder the explanation. Thanks, John.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Typically, it seems people expect single, double and triple to mean higher alcohol content.  But that is not exactly true.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You have single and double bocks with the same alcohol content.  Take Weihensthephaner for example (a respected 1000-year old monastic brewery): Weihenstephaner Korbinian is a double with 7.4% ABV. Weihenstephaner Vitus is a single bock with a higher ABV of 7.7%.  In this case, the single has a higher ABV than the double.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;More grains and more sugar do not equal more alcohol.  The strain of yeast and temperature determine the survivability.  Some yeast can live at high alcohol levels.  You can feed them all the sugar and grains and they will still die and stop fermentation (producing alcohol) when the alcohol level 'limit' is reached.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The eisbock gets a higher ABV by freezing the beer and removing ice.  This removal of water is how the alcohol content is increased.  Again, most yeast cannot reach 12% (which one typically finds in an eisbock).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The single, double, triple label has to do with the strength of the beer overall, including nutrition (calories) and taste.  Remember, these 'doppels' were created for sustenance.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Careful with the word 'stronger' when talking about bocks.  It can mean more malty, darker, fuller, not just higher alcohol level.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Hobby&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some people do it as a pleasurable hobby.  You might also ask why someone would build furniture if they could buy it, or why they play a musical instrument if they can just listen to the radio.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Personal Taste&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You may like a particular style of beer that isn't popular.  And, especially in Germany, you may want to make a style of beer that you can't buy in the store - one that has other flavor ingredients, so it doesn't comply with the beer purity laws.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You ask a great question.  I think a great reason to do it is to learn.  I like the answer 'Personal Taste' above.  If you already know what you like you can make it.  But, if you're just playing around brewing you can come up with tastes you never thought of.  You might even like your own recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hello from the homebrew community.  There are many reasons to brew yourself, and the first reason is because you can.   This question is the same as "why bake your own bread?", "why grow your own food?", "why start your own business?"  Because you can!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is something primal and fundamentally connected to nature about brewing, and being able to harness a fungus to produce alcohol.  Not only this, but something spectacularly human about being able to produce something by yourself, and brewing beer and wine is surprisingly easy.  Consider that you then get to drink something you made and the satisfaction of being self-reliant in this respect.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The satisfaction of self-improvement and being able to share your creations with others can't be put into words.  You most certainly can buy beer, but you absolutely can't buy the beer I make.   Also, mine costs a fraction of the price that you pay others to make for you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I hope I have answered your question.   We brew because we can, because yeast is freely available to all, and because it improves our skills and human capital.  Most of all, just like any trade, whether it be a carpenter, a butcher, or a chef.... we get to enjoy the fruits of our labour of love.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Because its a lot of fun! I always feel like a mad scientist when I'm boiling up the wort on the stove adding ingredients, especially when adding the hops. Its quite amazing to watch the yeast consuming the sugars and making the alcohol, yes you can see it!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Homebrew is healthy for you. It is a living beverage. All the yeast, enzymes and vitamins are all there for you just like nature intended. Large commercial brewers filter most of this out and some even have to add back in the carbonation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Homebrew is not dangerous, the worst that will happen is bacteria will spoil the beer's taste. There is no documented case of contaminated beer that has killed anyone. The theory is since the yeast micro-organism already 'lives' in the beer they create an environment that is not favorable to other micro-organisms.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finally if you are not old enough to buy alcohol, usually you can buy the ingredients and make it yourself. The brew shop I frequent is very close to a large college campus. Coincidence? I think not.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's exactly as with food.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;By cooking* at home, my wife and I can always get the food** that we want, exactly the way we want it. There is a chance of us screwing up and ending up with bad food**, but with practice that doesn't happen very often. There is some food** that we are not well equipped or trained to make, but that we happily buy from professionals. And it's cheaper to do your own cooking* than to buy everything ready-made, if you discount the cost of labour and appliances.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you want to exclusively have food** that someone else makes, that's your choice, and modern society can provide. But I think cooking* at home really is rather sensible.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sour_beer" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wiki page on Sour Beer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"[S]our beers are made by intentionally allowing wild yeast strains or bacteria into the brew. Traditionally, Belgian brewers allowed wild yeast to enter the brew naturally through the barrels or during the cooling of the wort in a coolship open to the outside air – an unpredictable process that many modern brewers avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The most common agents used to intentionally sour beer are Lactobacillus, Brettanomyces, and Pediococcus. Another method for achieving a tart flavor is adding fruit during the aging process to spur a secondary fermentation or contribute microbes present on the fruit's skin."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are a fan of BIG beers.  Let me suggest the mother of all pumpkin beers, &lt;strong&gt;Avery's pumpKYn&lt;/strong&gt;.  I try to land a few bottles every year.  It is expensive, but it is not the type of beer one drinks several bottles of.  Each year, the ABV sits around 15 to 16 percent.  I like to say that this is the pumpkin beer that should end every other breweries' attempts to craft a pumpkin beer.  They should all stop and deem Avery the winner.  It is not just a little aroma of pumpkin, it is a mouthful of thanksgiving with each sip.  This beer is heavy and creamy and fills your nose with nutmeg and cinnamon.  Skip a meal for this one, it will fill your stomach.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you want to explore a wonderful variety of this brew.  I would suggest &lt;strong&gt;Avery's RUMPKIN&lt;/strong&gt;, which is their pumpkin ale aged in rum barrels. This is a bit more of a kick in the mount though, as it not only get's a great deal of sweetness from the rum, it also gets a bit more alcohol too.  Rum barrel aging is a unique process.  So you get to try something that is likely new to you.  So often, brewers use other spirit and wine barrels, but you do not see as many use rum or tequila barrels.  Kudos to Avery for that.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Both brews are priced around 10 bucks per 12oz bottle.  And you will need to shop at a specialty store for them.  I occasionally see them in Schnucks in Saint Louis though (which is a grocery store).  They are pretty rough when they are fresh.  So I like to grab a stock each year, then drink the ones I purchased the year before.  Age them upright at cellar temps, IN THE DARK.  I can not stress that enough.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy them.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'll take a stab at this... Absinthe is an unregulated name unlike something like Champagne which is highly regulated name/place. With Champagne you can only use Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay in making it and it has to be grown in the Champagne region. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Absinthe can be made by any distiller anywhere in the world. What that means is that you could put whatever you want into a bottle and call it Absinthe (within liquor regulations). True that traditional Absinthe is a green color, from wormwood, but using other herbs or plants could change it a different color. But a quick look around the web yielded several wildly colored examples called Absinthe. So, if it bugs you, only drink green Absinthe and ignore the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Clear Absinthe&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Absinthe is made much in the same way that many gins are.  You take neutral spirits, add botanicals (wormwood and anise), and re-distill.  Anything that comes out of the still will be clear.  Some absinthes at this point are finished, these will be called blanche (white) or sometime la bleue.  The first absinthe available in Val-de-Travers (the birthplace of absinthe) after the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/04/world/europe/rebirth-of-the-potion-that-made-valdetravers-famous.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;ban in Switzerland was lifted&lt;/a&gt; was a blanche.  That same bottling was the driving force behind making it legal in the United States &lt;a href="http://www.bevlaw.com/absintheinamerica/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;(interview of lawyer who fought the ban)&lt;/a&gt;.  It can be really good stuff.  Any of these can be really easily colored.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Green Absinthe&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Usually absinthe gets a second chance to mingle (macerate) with some herbs after it's sprung from the still, this style is known at verte.  This is when it gets it's color, as well as some extra flavor and aroma. It's a more complex flavor.  The color that the chlorophyll imparts is dull.  If it's neon green there was &lt;a href="http://realabsinthe.blogspot.com/2011/06/what-makes-green-fairy-green.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;food coloring added&lt;/a&gt; and some of these "greener" varieties are actually blanche at heart.  Also of note is that sometimes these food colored types add sugar, to make it friendlier to less experienced drinkers (or to hide poor distillation technique as happens with vodka).  There is at least &lt;a href="https://www.absinthes.com/absinthe-adnams-rouge-p935" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;one non-green bottling&lt;/a&gt; that I know of that is still macerated post distillation, but uses hibiscus which turns it red.  These methods of coloration don't make them any less of a true absinthe, they do use wormwood (and equally important, anise).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Czech Absinth (without the e)&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The most common non-green "absinthe" is so called Czech-style, also known as Bohemian style.  These are &lt;a href="http://wormwoodsociety.org/index.php/general-information-education-214/39-whats-wrong-with-bohemian-qstyleq-absinth" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;not rightly called absinthe&lt;/a&gt; and are historically known for very low quality.  Instead of distilling the botanicals in the alcohol, they are cold compounded.  It's made either by mixing spirits, flavoring oils, and food coloring or by macerating the botanicals without distillation.  Be wary of absinthes &lt;a href="https://www.diffordsguide.com/encyclopedia/275/bws/absinthe-how-is-absinthe-made" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;much over 140 proof&lt;/a&gt;, as they are frequently Czech-style.  Do be aware that they're called Czech-style because that's where the style originated and where most of this variety still comes from, however the Czech Republic does have &lt;a href="http://www.praguepost.com/articles/2006/04/26/worthy-of-their-name.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;good examples of absinthe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think they would not make a good candidate for beer or wine bottles if you want to subject them to moisture or cold&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stickergiant.com/static-cling-decals" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Static Cling Labels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Static Clings are usually made of a flexible vinyl or plastic that has a very smooth coat and will stick to clean glass surfaces utilizing the moisture in the air and on the glass to adhere to the surface. In cold weather and dry climates static clings tend to dry up, freeze and then fall off easily. The vinyl material will not retain its "cling" abilities for more than a year or two depending on the conditions where the cling is exposed. Some static cling options can be refreshed with soap and water, which is great for long-term use. Static Clings may need a custom quote.&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'll take a stab at this... I would start with a good homebrewing book and walk through the process. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Complete-Joy-Homebrewing-Fourth-Revised/dp/0062215752" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Complete Joy of Homebrewing&lt;/a&gt; is where I started 20 years ago and it's still a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I was also very active in my homebrew club so I would definitely reach out to them too. You can learn so much so quickly watching someone else. I think this is where you would learn a lot about beer styles and tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I taught in the wine making program at a local community college for a couple of years. This school also had a brewing program. I would only go this route if you really, really want to be a serious brewer. You can brew really excellent beer just learning on your own or hanging out at a homebrew club.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's been a long time since I originally asked this question. While my contributing answer here doesn't &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; clear up why draught beer (maybe, maybe doesn't) taste better than bottled beer, two things are clear to me now after spending a lot of time reflecting on the difference:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As Tom pointed out in the very first comment, drinking beer (and coffee too, for that matter!) out of a small spout (bottle, travel mug, etc.) blocks your nose from inhaling the aromas of the beer. This limits the amount of flavour you can sense. Pouring the bottled beer into a glass dramatically improves its flavour because the open mouth of the glass allows you to taste &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; smell.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There's an inverse relationship between perceived "better" taste and the volume of bottles a brewery produces (and how far they intend to distribute). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer brewed at a local microbrew has a shelf-life of only a few weeks on the outside; preservatives are limited or omitted and their ingredients are typically fresh, with a comparably short self-life. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Larger breweries distribute further distances, demand a longer shelf-life, and usually have a need to maintain a consistent taste across their entire production line and the resulting shelf-life. These breweries use high-volume equipment (an increase in the amount the beer is processed) and high-volume ingredients (preservatives in ingredients make them last longer, but may not be fresh). It also becomes increasingly difficult to quality-control when mass-producing —  these breweries are less likely to take risks, and they rely on machinery to achieve consistency, often sacrificing quality. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;tl;dr:&lt;/em&gt; draught beer, like micro-brewed beer was never intended to last for months or years on the shelf, and thus preservatives don't need to be factored into the production, and the beer is liable to be fresher more flavourful.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One last bonus point&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've also noticed that at times, bottled microbrews, poured into a glass can actually taste &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than their draught counterparts. Go figure ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have a similar question, but interpret the original question differently - probably because I am a home brewer that lets the beer carbonate naturally. If you are forcing CO2 into the beer, I imagine you have greater control over levels of carbonation. However, I understand that the final gravity, alcohol content, amount of sugar, and temperature have the most significant impact on carbonation in the bottle. The primary factors would be Lower FG and ABV will increase carbonation, and secondarily a little more sugar and time (&gt;3weeks) will increase carbonation. This all assumes you are storing the beer in a temp range that makes for happy yeast.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am going to put my two bits into this question also.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are several existing colored absinthe on the market at the moment and a couple of ways to get various colored varieties. Artificial coloring is the most common.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Absinthe may be found in the following colors: &lt;strong&gt;Green, Red (or Rose), Yellow, Brown, Clear and Blue.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One way to get the desired colored is to make your own absinthe as can be seen in the following recipe. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Put the dry herbs in a large jar. Dampen slightly. Add 800 milliliters of 85-95 percent alcohol. Wine spirits make a better product than pure grain alcohol. Let steep for several days - a week is better - shaking occasion absinthe. Then add 600 milliliters of water and let the whole macerate for another day. Decant off the liquid squeezing as much from the mass of herb as possible. Wet the herbs with some vodka and squeeze again. Recipe should give a little over a liter and a half of green liquor. It must then be distilled... - &lt;a href="http://absinthe.msjekyll.com/recipe.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Traditional absinthe recipe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There or other non-traditional herbs and artificial coloring agents that are used to make a particular color also.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Absinthe can be classified differently&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;By color:&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Green absinthe – classically natural color of absinthe. Color can vary from deep emerald to light green or olive shade. Practically every manufacturer produces green absinthe. &lt;strong&gt;But because the natural dye (chlorophyll from the leaves) is not durable therefore manufacturers in most cases use artificial coloring.&lt;/strong&gt; To preserve natural green color of absinthe it is bottle in green or brown bottles. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Yellow absinthe – is usually natural colored because natural dye from chlorophyll has a tendency to lose its color and become more yellowish in couple of months after production (aging of absinthe). &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Red absinthe – is colored by extract of pomegranate or macerated with blossoms of hibiscus what gives absinthe light-ruby shade and original after-taste. But nowadays majority of red absinthes are artificially colored. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Brown absinthe – unlike all the other absinthes this kind is macerated with the roots of wormwood not the leaves of blossoms. Also dark color can be achieved by adding black cutch extract which brings slight flavour of berries. - &lt;a href="http://absinthe-time.eu/EN/menu/kinds-of-absinthe" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Kinds of Absinthe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia has this to say about absinthe:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Absinthe may also be naturally coloured pink or red using rose or hibiscus flowers. This was referred to as a &lt;strong&gt;rose&lt;/strong&gt; (pink) or &lt;strong&gt;rouge&lt;/strong&gt; (red) absinthe. Only one historical brand of rose absinthe has been documented.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Many contemporary absinthe critics simply classify absinthe as distilled or mixed, according to its production method. And while the former is generally considered far superior in quality to the latter, an absinthe's simple claim of being 'distilled' makes no guarantee as to the quality of its base ingredients or the skill of its maker.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blanche&lt;/strong&gt;, or la Bleue: Blanche absinthe (also referred to as la Bleue in Switzerland) is bottled directly following distillation and reduction, and is uncoloured (clear). The name la Bleue was originally a term used for bootleg Swiss absinthe, but has become a popular term for post-ban-style Swiss absinthe in general.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As noted in &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/a/6410/5064"&gt;Montijello's excellent answer&lt;/a&gt;, clear absinthe may be easily artificially colored.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of Clear Absinthes on the market as can be seen on the following website:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.absinthes.com/en/clear-absinthe-s328" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Clear Absinthe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;This is usually the favourite of people trying absinthe for the first time, and of the most experience absintheurs: where absinthe drinkers settle again in the end, having explored the world of green absinthe. Quite simply because it is balanced and delicious. Much of the finest absinthe is clear. Also known as Blanche, La Bleue, and white absinthe...&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would like to add that although I have not confirmed it I read somewhere the purity laws had less to do with "making great beer" and more to do with them being poor. They didn't want certain grains or things being used for beer as it drove up the price of bread and other foods. In the following article it is states they didn't want to waste valuable grains for beer: &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/04/0423deutsche-reinheitsgebot-german-beer-purity-law/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;April 23, 1516: Bavaria Cracks Down on Beer Brewers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I just add it at the secondary fermentation stage when I homebrew beer. I made a belgian style wheat beer and simply added some vanilla extract.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;edit : I just added some cloves to a dark beer brew when decanting it out of my fermentation vessel. Worked very well. Additions don't need to be a liquid. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;28% ABV is the best I have managed with my yeast though it needs plenty of sugar added to whatever you are brewing apart from mead. Getting the yeast from the boot's from it's original 8% to 20% took 8 years getting it from 20% to 28% has taken 25 year's and I haven't been able to get any increase on that 28% in the last 5 years though it is getting more consistent &amp;amp; given enough sugar it rarely dips below 28%.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ignore any references to Brewmeister here there "cold brewing" process is Fractional freezing more conmanly called Freeze distillation where they remove water by freezing it out this has nothing to do with the brewing process.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's difficult to answer why fermentation did not complete without further information.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's quite possible the sugar content was too high and pH to low for whatever yeast was added to survive and begin fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Vinegar however is created when bacteria that produce acetic acid are present in an environment with a sugar source and oxygen. They will thrive off of the sugar just like brewer's yeast, but will also produce acetic acid as a byproduct of their life processes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you wish to make cherry wine, I would suggest diluting the juice down to somewhere in the range of a sugar concentration of 10 percent, measuring with a hydrometer or refractometer, and using a yeast, possibly a dry wine yeast, that can withstand alcohol in ranges of 10-14 percent abv.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, I would check to see if it's still drinkable. You might have a carboy of apple cider vinegar if you haven't put any sulfites into it or somehow prevented from oxidation. The way to test it is to get a siphon (that you have sanitized) and suck out a little to taste. If it tastes ok, then you need to prepare for bottling. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would follow these &lt;a href="http://www.greatfermentations.com/wp-content/themes/greatfermentations/images/blog/2012/04/Cider-Tech-Revised.pdf" rel="noreferrer"&gt;directions&lt;/a&gt; except when it says to prime with 1/2 cup of corn sugar, I would put in a little yeast (maybe a tablespoon?) and mix with some water before you bottle. Make sure the yeast has dissolved. I'm sure the yeast in your carboy is dead at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I once did the same thing. I must have added water to the fermentation
					 lock 4 or 5 times. The taste was fine so i just bottled it as usual. I always suck up the part of yeast when bottling. by the way, the yeast is dormant not dead.  Adding additional yeast would not hurt. Just don't add it before boiling the sugar and water or cider or it will be dead.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Well, I've been brewing for more than a year. I already did 1 gallon to 5 gallons, the quality of the beer is the same. You must pay attention in all proccess not just in the used kit.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My friends and I use a simple kit, to make the beer most archaic. Except the first time, the others results were very good.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I talk more of the beers that we made in &lt;a href="https://sommelieria.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://sommelieria.wordpress.com/&lt;/a&gt;. It's in Portuguese but can help you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think it depends on a lot of factors, but you should be able to make high quality beer. You just have to pay a lot of attention to detail. Measuring ingredients becomes super important. A little error can screw up a beer. In bigger batches there is more room for error. Same with mashing. You need to have a really good way to keep the mash at the proper temperature, which can be hard in a small container. Otherwise, there is no reason a 1 gallon batch can't be just as good.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have used a soda stream to carbonate wine in the past. It works well with very little work. If you want to go with an old school method of carbonating in the bottle then you must be sure that your bottles are rated for 90PSI. Once the fermenting is done in the bottle, turn the bottle upside down so that the yeast sediment settles in the neck of the bottle. Once the yeast has settled and your wine or cider looks clear, you then place it in a freezer and watch for ice to form in the neck first. Once the yeast sediment freezes in the neck only, remove it from the freezer and open the bottle and the frozen yeast can be easily removed. Most of the time the pressure from the carbonation will push the frozen yeast wad out. You can then top it off with more wine or cider if you plan on storing it for later.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Simplified definition:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're fermenting grains, it's beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're fermenting fruits, it's wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're fermenting honey, it's mead.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's not really that simple, because there are beers that use fruit (e.g., cherry lambic, raspberry wheat), beers that use honey (it's a fairly common adjunct), wines that use fruit (e.g., &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EtZoMR4nN8" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;elderberry wine&lt;/a&gt;), and a whole lot of meads that use fruit. The crossover is substantial. When you consider hard ciders, it gets even more complicated (is apple wine really a cider?).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The base ingredient of beer is almost always malted barley. Even beers named for another grain — like wheat beer, oatmeal stout, rye beer — use malted barley as a base. Hops are a critical ingredient in beer for two reasons: bittering and aroma.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The base ingredient of mead is always honey. I've had mead with hops (&lt;a href="http://charmcitymeadworks.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Charm City&lt;/a&gt; makes one), but it's uncommon, and I personally don't like the flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's more common to find a winery that makes mead than a brewery that makes mead. There's an outstanding one in Montana called &lt;a href="https://www.hiddenlegendwinery.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Hidden Legend&lt;/a&gt;. They also make a mead/wine blend called a "pyment," which was popular in the 15th century or so.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some sugars won't start a fermentation with brewer's yeast at all, such a lactose. In such case, sooner or later other organisms would take over (e.g. lactobacteria).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Any sugars that can be fermented, would ferment at different speeds. As there is usually more than one kind of sugar present, the easy ones ferment first until the alcohol kills off the yeast, leaving the more difficult ones behind. Fermentation usually continues at that point, just a lot more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The difference in the effect is minor as long as everything is fully fermented. An example of such a difference is fruit wines and beer. Fruit wines contain minor amounts of methanol while beer usually does not. Differences in flavour are more about what is not fermented.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Mannose can definitely be fermented by brewer's yeast. Dextrose is just another name for glucose.     &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I recently watched the 2010 Maia Liddell documentary, &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1794761/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Colditz The Legend&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Colditz Castle was a maximum security prison from which no one was meant to escape... but escape they did. Take a fresh look at the legendary escapes, featuring stories from both Colditz survivors and their extended families.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Listening to the narratives by former British officers held captive and memories and anecdotes by family (sons, daughters, grandchildren) prompted Google searches, among them these.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nysun.com/obituaries/george-drew-87-british-pow-brewed-turnip-hooch/23502/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;George Drew, 87, British POW Brewed Turnip Hooch at Colditz &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Major George Drew, who has died aged 87, helped his fellow prisoners to cope with the boredom and deprivations of Colditz Castle during World War II by producing potent homemade alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;He and his friend Pat Fergusson first tried to brew from the sugar and raisins from Red Cross parcels, but failed. Then they realized that there was sufficient sugar for fermentation in the turnip jam supplied by the Germans. Mixing the jam with yeast and water, they used a piece of purloined drainpipe and a large can, sealed with plaster of Paris from the sick bay, to produce hooch for such events as St. Valentine's and St. Patrick's Days.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;However, the effects of the more than 100 proof alcohol could be severe, even leading to temporary blindness. Dental fillings would fall out. If a man was having obvious difficulty walking and talking in the castle yard it was said that he was "jam happy."&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;When Drew and Fergusson took part in the British television series "Escape From Colditz" in 2000, they made their potion for the first time since 1945. Taking the first glass before the camera, Drew said "Dear God," remarked that the smell was not quite as bad as it used to be, then drank again. "Oh Christ," he gasped.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And although not brewed, a group of tunnelers, after nine months of digging, took a wrong turn and emerged, fortuitously, in the castle’s wine cellar, enjoying 137 bottles, about four and a half bottles per person. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Article: &lt;a href="https://pilcrow.squarespace.com/stories/colditz" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;In 1940 British POWs accidentally tunneled into a Nazi colonel's wine cellar and proceeded to drink everything they saw&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
