					&lt;p&gt;I expect a high alcohol beer, with a lot of complex flavors.  One that the alcohol content will "sneak" up on you because it isn't very obvious in the taste.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Quoting from the &lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style18.php#1c"&gt;Beer Judge Criteria&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Aroma: Complex with moderate to significant spiciness, moderate
					  fruity esters and low alcohol and hop aromas. Generous spicy, peppery,
					  sometimes clove-like phenols. Esters are often reminiscent of citrus
					  fruits such as oranges, but may sometimes have a slight banana
					  character. A low yet distinctive spicy, floral, sometimes perfumy hop
					  character is usually found. Alcohols are soft, spicy and low in
					  intensity. No hot alcohol or solventy aromas. The malt character is
					  light. No diacetyl.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Appearance: Deep yellow to deep gold in color. Good clarity.
					  Effervescent. Long-lasting, creamy, rocky, white head resulting in
					  characteristic “Belgian lace” on the glass as it fades.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Flavor: Marriage of spicy, fruity and alcohol flavors supported by a
					  soft malt character. Low to moderate phenols are peppery in character.
					  Esters are reminiscent of citrus fruit such as orange or sometimes
					  lemon. A low to moderate spicy hop character is usually found.
					  Alcohols are soft, spicy, often a bit sweet and low in intensity.
					  Bitterness is typically medium to high from a combination of hop
					  bitterness and yeast-produced phenolics. Substantial carbonation and
					  bitterness lends a dry finish with a moderately bitter aftertaste. No
					  diacetyl.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body, although lighter than the
					  substantial gravity would suggest (thanks to sugar and high
					  carbonation). High alcohol content adds a pleasant creaminess but
					  little to no obvious warming sensation. No hot alcohol or solventy
					  character. Always effervescent. Never astringent.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Overall Impression: Strongly resembles a Strong Golden Ale but
					  slightly darker and somewhat fuller-bodied. Usually has a more rounded
					  malt flavor but should not be sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Comments: High in alcohol but does not taste strongly of alcohol. The
					  best examples are sneaky, not obvious. High carbonation and
					  attenuation helps to bring out the many flavors and to increase the
					  perception of a dry finish. Most Trappist versions have at least 30
					  IBUs and are very dry. Traditionally bottle-conditioned (“refermented
					  in the bottle”).&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;History: Originally popularized by the Trappist monastery at
					  Westmalle.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Ingredients: The light color and relatively light body for a beer of
					  this strength are the result of using Pilsner malt and up to 20% white
					  sugar. Noble hops or Styrian Goldings are commonly used. Belgian yeast
					  strains are used – those that produce fruity esters, spicy phenolics
					  and higher alcohols – often aided by slightly warmer fermentation
					  temperatures. Spice additions are generally not traditional, and if
					  used, should not be recognizable as such. Fairly soft water.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am a big fan of tripels and quadrupels.  They are dark, and much smoother, I find, than blondes and other lower-alcohol beers (and yes, tripels are substantially more alcoholic).  Contrary to the previous answer, I find they taste less bitter than typical beers, although perhaps it may be because the bitterness is masked by the other flavors perhaps?  It may depend, though; Chimay yellow label has a note of bitterness that I don't find in, say, a Westmalle.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Part of it depends on what you're used to.  If you're used to mass-market beers you will find these very different.  Heavier and more substantial.  Richer, more luxurious.  Very much not something you quaff down a few at a time to quench your thirst; these are savored.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are also quadrupels, such as the Roquefort 10 or Westvleteren XII, which are even better in my mind. These are very dark and pack an alcoholic punch.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Dubbels and Tripels are vastly different beers. While dubbels are generally something akin to a brown ale, malt forward with some light hints of dark fruit and roastiness, Tripels are pale to golden, being a vehicle for both the yeast flavors (clove/bananna), fruity esters, and the whims of the brewer (Belgian candi sugar, coriander and other spices are common additions).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The additional Trappist style ale the Quadripel (Quad) is much more like a bigger version of the dubbel, although they have their own distinct flavor profiles as well. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's often a misconception that one comes forth from the other, this is incorrect. The name was used to indicate the strength of the Westmalle beers. Originally there was the Enkel, Dubbel and Tripel. It is said that they represent the holy trinity. Later quadruppels were added. Both Dubbel and Tripel as name were first used by the Trappist brewery of Westmalle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Westmalle produced the first dark beer in 1856 named "Dubbel" (the recipe was changed in 1926). Dubbels are dark in color, and tend to have malt flavors dominating over hops. Whereas the Quadrupels have more of a fruit presence, the Dubbels tend to be a bit spicier with strong caramel flavors. They tend to have an ABV of 6.5-9.0%.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Chimay Red&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;La Trappe Dubbel&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Ommegang&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Westvleteren 8 &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Rochefort 6&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Westmalle Dubbel&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Tripels are lighter color, often blonde. They are generally a lot fruitier and lighter in flavor. The name Tripel originally was first used in 1956 by the Westmalle brewery to name their strongest beer (originally produced in 1930 and named Superbier, it was renamed to Tripel). The ABV is a lot higher than the double,  8.0-12.0%. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Tripel Karmeliet&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Westmalle Tripel&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;St. Bernardus Tripel&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Leuvense Tripel&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Chimay Cinq Cents Tripel &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As stated above, if you want to know about a certain style the &lt;a href="http://bjcp.org/2008styles/catdex.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;BJCP guidelines&lt;/a&gt; are a great place to start.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not all styles are reflected in the BJCP guidelines though.  For instance, the BJCP doesn't recognize Black IPAs, or American Wild Ales.  The &lt;a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/style" rel="nofollow"&gt;Beer Advocate style guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, and the guidelines from the &lt;a href="http://www.greatamericanbeerfestival.com/the-competition/beer-styles/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Great American Beer Festival&lt;/a&gt; might also be useful to you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With regard to your specific question about Tripels, you can read my own thoughts about them on my blog (I'm trying to drink all the BJCP styles are write about them):&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Depends what you mean with Belgian Triple. As I understand in the US it is used as a style name and it is base on the Westmalle Triple. You can see the style discription in the answer of Schleis. But if you want to know what to expect, try Westmalle Triple, it's a good (my preferred) benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In Belgium it's not a style. It's merely a label to mark that more ingredient were used, comparatively with the other beers within the same brewery.
					A little history:
					The ingredients to make beer were expensive in the middle ages, so the brewers tried to use as little as possible for there beer. There was however also an market for more tasteful, more expensive, beer. To differentiate between the brewed barrels they used X for the cheap bear, XX for the expensive one. Not saying that there were double the ingredients in it, just more. Later came also XXX. You can still find these X's on some labels these days.
					The name Triple is a more recent appellation (1930's), but it is based on the same idea.
					A classic trio you find in Belgium, but with a lot of exceptions, is a blond(X), a brown (XX, double) and a strong blond ale (XXX, triple). These are relative references, within the brewery and like already mentioned, more ingredients, not doubling or tripling the amount of ingredients. Making the beers stronger in alcohol and taste.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I guess you now also know what to expect with a quadruple...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a Belgian chap, I obviously love our beer :). More specific, my favorite beers are always tripel beers.
					The thing about tripel beers is that the fermentation is achieved further in the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In general I can tell you all tripel beers are always pretty blonde looking (maybe slightly darker) and doubles are always darker (like really brown!).
					In Belgium, we would call a double beer a dark beer (Double Leffe we would call: Donkere Leffe or Dark Leffe in English).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The taste of double beers will always be sweeter while tripel beers are far more bitter.
					I don't like those sweet drinks so I very much prefer tripel beers.
					However, all tripel beers are different from each other so there is not a real way of describing them. In general bitter, but there are sweeter tripels as well...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The difference in taste between blonde and tripel beers in general is that tripel beers have far more flavors (= more expensive) than blonde beers. The sad thing is that blonde beers are very popular and I don't even know why... Tripel beers have way more flavors :).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a side note, my favorite beers are: Tripel Karmeliet and Tripel Kasteelbier.
					The more poular (blonde) beers are Duvel and Leffe for example. Both in my opinion hugely overrated beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In Dutch the names mean double and triple, they originated at the Belgian Westmalle abbey brewery where the double was a strong brown ale. Their tripel was the name they gave to their strongest beer, a blonde pale ale.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These beers quickly became popular and were imitated worldwide as were their names. The convention now is as following, a dubbel is a strong (6%-8% abv) dark ale, a tripel is a strong pale ale in the style of Westmalle tripel (9.5%). A quadrupel is an ale stronger than a tripel (+10%) but beyond that there is no real agreement on what it should be. Westvleteren 12 is an example of a quadrupel.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Color tends to come primarily from the malt bill used (darker roasted malts lending darker color to a beer).  In the case of Belgian beers, a "candi" sugar (derived from beets) may used as an additive, and different styles use different types of candi sugars.  For dubbels in particular, the candi is a darker variety, made with a (more) substantial dose of molasses, which would darken the beer further.  A tripel uses a candi with less molasses.&lt;/p&gt;
