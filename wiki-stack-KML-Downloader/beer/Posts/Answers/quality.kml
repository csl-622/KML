					&lt;p&gt;I can answer this... once you get above about $20 a bottle is not proportional to the value you get out of it. The flavors/tastes simply don't give you the value above that range. A $100 or $1000 bottle of wine starts to get into &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;veblen goods&lt;/a&gt; territory. Production costs simply stop contributing to the price on the self above this point. I've tasted several 100 point rated wines and thought where is the emperors new clothes!?!? OK, have tasted one wine that was $10000 a bottle and 230 years old from Madeira that absolutely blew my socks off but those are rare. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Veblen Goods from Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;A price increase may increase that high status and perception of exclusivity, thereby making the good even more preferable. At the other end of the spectrum, with luxury items priced equal to non-luxury items of lower quality, all else being equal more people would buy the luxury items, even though a few Veblen-seekers would not. Thus, even a Veblen good is subject to the dictum that demand moves conversely to price, although the response of demand to price is not consistent at all points on the demand curve.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Certainly as many goods there is diminishing return.    &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wines between $10 - $20 is a narrow range.  If you are happy in that range then no reason to get outside that range.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I find many wines under $10 I consider drinkable.  Under $10 you will also get more variation from bottle to bottle.  They are often just buying grapes in bulk.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are many wines in the $20 - $30 range that are what I call no regrets wines.  Even if I was very rich those would still be my daily drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A lot is the grape:  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;A pinot nior you need to get close to $20 as it is low yield grape&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;A malbec I don't spend more than $12  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;An old vine zinfindal then need to get into $40 range or I would
					rather just drink a $20 merlot&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;An $80 wine is certainly not twice as good a $40 but there are people with the budget for $80+ wine. Most people can find a lot of good wines in the $4 - $40 range that fit their taste.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not sure if it is true but Kevin O'Leary on Shark Tank says 90% of wine sold is $13 or less a bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I cannot speak for the canadian market, as i do not live here, but in France  we have quite a large choice, and were bottle rank from 5€ to 200€ in a good wine shop.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Assuming there is little return threshold on wine above $20 is, in my humble opinion, a mistake. Because &lt;strong&gt;you don't drink a price, but a work&lt;/strong&gt;. And good work is never cheap.
					I'm not talking about marketing, a wine harvested by a dwarf  wrapped in ham on a full moon night before sorting the grape on the tights of virgins ... but about solid facts.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You might consider this :&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Producer choices&lt;/strong&gt; Above everything, a wine producer is a skilled craftman whom makes soil, cultivation,  harvesting, ageing choices, to make the wine that fits his objectives. Whereas some may aim for low quality high quantity, a great number intend to make the best price over quality wine. And those choices can be expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weather&lt;/strong&gt; It's plain stupid, but a wine is also a product of rains, snow, temperatures, insects, sickness ... production is random. Of course, you can add water, persticides, fertilizers, use UV light by night and cloudy days. But it'll not taste the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soil&amp;amp;terroir&lt;/strong&gt; Good soil is rare, and what is rare is expensive. Right terroir also is. Vine don't grow everywhere, and some places are better than other. And as those lands are rare ... Keep in mind that a century old vineyard and a ten years old one doesn't make the same grapes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breeding&lt;/strong&gt; An industrial wine in steel cask doesn't age and develops flavor the same than in a concrete tank or wood barrel. A wine in a cellar doesn't age like one in estufagem. A wine draught too young will never be good. Don't forget that Pinot Noir, only vines allowed in Burgundy has to age two years in oak barrel and three years in bottle before being opened ? Or that a third of a Savagnin wine barrel evaporate in oxydation to get the taste right ? Well, the producer also has return treshold concerns ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harvesting&lt;/strong&gt; If the harvest is machine made, it's cheap, but immature or rotten grapes go to the pressoir. If it's hand made, it's expensive, but the grapes (and sometimes, every single seed) are harvested the right day : not before, not after. And even after harvest, not everything proceeds to the pressoir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legal or crafting obligations&lt;/strong&gt; In several places in Europe, traditions, rules, even laws determines quality standard. &lt;em&gt;When only the upper two third of an harvest can be made into wine, and the worst third can only be transformed into other products, it has a cost. In France, you cannot put wood dust in your wine to flavour it woody. If you want the wood tastes, you get wood barrel. End of discussion. Adding sugar is restricted. You don't add brandy to cut fermentation. You don't add other fruits. In fact ... it must be 99.9% wine and 0.1% preservatives. If it needs something else than grapes, it's no wine. It's not a moral statement : it just simply isn't wine anymore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glass&lt;/strong&gt;. Is your glass suited for the wine, and its degustation ? It's a common mistake, but there are three kind of glasses : 1/ &lt;a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verre_%C3%A0_vin#D.C3.A9gustation_professionnelle" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;degustation&lt;/a&gt;, standardized to test several wine in same objective conditions 2/ figured : you don't drink Pils, Stout, IPA and Weizenbock in the same beerglass do you ; It does also apply to wine, old&amp;amp;young, white&amp;amp;red does not required the same shape 3/ fancy bullshit. Sorry you bought them. And it's  common in restaurant to have the wrong kind of glass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pairing&lt;/strong&gt; Not every wine fits every dish. Not every wine fits every time of day. Not every wine meets your mood at a precise time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your tastes&lt;/strong&gt; I'm rude, but do you know what you like ? I'm fond of oxydated wines. Most drinkers can't bear them. I don't enjoy champagne. Most drinkers swear by it. You might not have met what you like, and thus you might not know enough in oenology to assess nor appreciate the subtleties. It's easy to learn (if you have a good teacher), but it takes time. I do not buy expensive wines. Because i'm broke. And because i cannot enjoy them fully : i learn and wait until i'm able to enjoy them &lt;em&gt;When i got my drivers licence, i drived a car older than i was. Today i can ride a common sports car. But i would not dare to drive a Porsche or a Ferrari : i would do nothing but find the nearest wall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I might expose twenty other factors that determines both price and quality.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are great wines under 10€. Really ! Simple and straightforwards.
					There are awful wines over 20€. Really ! Miscrafted, mishandled ...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, please, step over your range boundaries. The threshold you wonder is several rung above the price's ladder ! Ask oenologists, do visit wine trade fair, try to meet producers ... or simply visit a true cellarman in his shop. It'll blow your tastebuds !&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Source : my experience as beer cellarman for the importance of the crafting. And several hundred different wine bottle over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

					  &lt;p&gt;how can I choose between two bottles in a non-arbitrary, and objective way?&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can't. It's purely a subjective exercise. It is a dark art that takes a lot of tasting and learning what regions you like and winemakers you like. Even high points from a well known critic aren't a sure bet. If I were you, I would start reading Wine Spectator and Wine Advocate and whatever online wine resources you can find to get an education about what you like. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Things are easier in Europe where they more tightly control the wine making/grape growing process and some regions like Bordeaux, Champagne and Burgundy you can assume a certain high quality from a certain appellation. In the "New" world (USA, Australia, South Africa, etc) it's more of a crap shoot. Napa Valley wine is not a sure bet. It involves a lot of research and personal preference. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;People spend many years and tons of money trying to figure this out and it's a never ending process. The journey is long and paved with many bad bottles. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Let's start with what are Nomex corks and what are natural corks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomex" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Nomex&lt;/a&gt; is a registered trademark for flame-resistant meta-aramid material developed in the early 1960s by DuPont and first marketed in 1967.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Nomex and related aramid polymers are related to nylon, but have aromatic backbones, and hence are more rigid and more durable. Nomex is the premier example of a meta variant of the aramids (Kevlar is a para aramid). Unlike Kevlar, Nomex cannot align during filament formation and has poorer strength. However, it has excellent thermal, chemical, and radiation resistance for a polymer material.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"Nomex corks" for wine do not exist. In fact "Nomex cork" material is used as a &lt;a href="http://www.auburn-mfg.com/gasket-material-guide.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;gasket material&lt;/a&gt; for engines and the like. &lt;strong&gt;I believe you are thinking of rubber corks.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Natural cork comes from the outer bark of the cork tree.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Cork is produced from the sponge like material taken from cork oak trees, also known as Quercus Suber. Cork oak trees are grown primarily in Portugal. Cork started to become the sealing material of choice in the late 1600’s when it became possible to create glass wine bottles with an almost uniform shape and design. It took until the late 1700’s to create easy to use corkscrews for the wine lover or tavern owner. At that point in history, cork replaced glass wine stoppers, which while they worked well, glass stoppers were not easy to remove without breaking the wine bottle. The pairing of the cork and wine bottle ushered fine wine into the modern age, as from that point forward, wine had the ability to age and evolve in the bottle. Interestingly cork and fine wine share another commonality. The cork, oak tree needs to be at least 25 years old before the material used to create the cork can be harvested. This is similar to the age of vines in many of the world’s best wine regions. While grape vines are harvested every year, cork trees are only able to be harvested once every nine years. - &lt;a href="http://www.thewinecellarinsider.com/wine-topics/wine-education-articles/wine-corks-everything-need-know-wine-corks/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wine Corks Everything You Need to Know About Wine Corks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternative wine closures or corks&lt;/strong&gt; can be seen here and many are known as rubber corks and plastic corks: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Alternative wine closures are substitute closures used in the wine industry for sealing wine bottles in place of traditional cork closures. The emergence of these alternatives has grown in response to quality control efforts by winemakers to protect against "cork taint" caused by the presence of the chemical trichloroanisole (TCA). - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_wine_closure" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Alternative wine closures (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are pros and cons to using of all types of corks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The problems with synthetic corks is the lack of a perfect seal. In turn that allows more unwanted air into the bottle, causing the wine to oxidize. Worse, many of the synthetic corks have been known to impart a slight rubber or chemical smell, damaging the wine. Beherns and Hitchcock, a producer of Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa California was one of the early proponents of plastic corks. Most of the wines bottled using those synthetic corks have not developed well. Many of those wines are defective. However, today, they have improved since their initial creation. Because the plastic corks allow air to integrate at a faster pace than normal corks, some winemakers actually prefer it. In fact, that has become part of the selling point as the corks can be ordered to allow for a more or less rapid transmission of air into the wine, based on the tightness of seal.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Wine corks do however have problems, the major issue being infection with TCA, which causes what is known by wine collectors and others in the wine business as Corked Wine. Corked bottles of wine remains a serious problem in the wine industry as many people think that it effects between 5% to 10% of all wine undrinkable.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The old saying that nothing lasts forever is especially true with wine. When a wine cork degrades, so does the wine, due to additional exposure to air, which in turn causes premature oxidization. Before that happens, for rare and expensive bottles, it might be possible to replace your old cork with a new wine cork. This is something you cannot do at home on your own. For more on replacing your wine cork, &lt;a href="http://www.thewinecellarinsider.com/wine-topics/wine-educational-questions/recorked-or-reconditioned-bottles-explained" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Everything you need to know about Re-Corking wine bottles.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Corks have been the undisputed choice to seal wine bottles for hundreds of years. But with all the alternative enclosures available these days, &lt;em&gt;by 2016, it is estimated that only 70% of all wine bottles today are sealed with natural corks.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Still, at the end of day, it is unlikely corks will be replaced as the sealer of choice for the best wines.&lt;/strong&gt; In part, there is the romance and tradition of removing the cork, coupled with that special popping sound that lets you know, you are about to drink a wine and that is something technology cannot improve on. - &lt;a href="http://www.thewinecellarinsider.com/wine-topics/wine-education-articles/wine-corks-everything-need-know-wine-corks/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wine Corks Everything You Need to Know About Wine Corks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Although natural cork is more eco-friendly, they are s slightly more expensive than their counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes and No. Expensive wines are &lt;em&gt;generally&lt;/em&gt; bottled in more expensive packaging because there is a greater profit margin and winemakers want to exude an air of exclusivity and expense. The unfortunately part is usually you can't see the cork because of the foil and the dark color of the bottle. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But, if you could visually inspect the cork before you open the bottle, yes those that tend to use more expensive corks generally mean a higher quality wine. Screwcaps and plastic corks generally mean a lower quality wine, EXCEPT in Australia and New Zealand where there is a large push to use screwcaps for all levels of wine to reduce TCA taint. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, if you could look at the cork, these are the things you might look for. &lt;/p&gt;
