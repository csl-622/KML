					  &lt;p&gt;While the names might differ, this is the key principle: there’s a
					  name for a large (425ml) and small (285ml) size in every state. Most
					  (but not all states) use schooner for the larger size, but the options
					  for the smaller one vary considerably:&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;there is no reason that I can find to why they have different measures but i have found a really good source of information to help understand what size beer to order &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;here is the handy guide for buying your &lt;a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2014/03/how-to-order-a-beer-in-every-australian-state/" rel="nofollow"&gt;beer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In short, it's because of taxation. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=wkUlAQAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA74633#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Commonwealth of Australia's Parliamentary Debates of 1904&lt;/a&gt; (p.8534),  The Honourable Chris Watson (who went on to become the 3rd Prime Minister) made a statement about the brewers of Sydney strongly objecting to a proposal for an excise duty on beer. The sentiment amongst Sydney's brewers was that the additional cost would be difficult to pass on to the consumer, and in fact they had thus far failed to do so. In response The Honourable Alexander Poynton, said that the tax had successfully been passed from brewers to consumers in South Australia by making the glasses smaller.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For the record, The Honourable Chris Watson expressed sadness at the notion of smaller glasses.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Why don't you do the work yourself. &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;amp;rlz=1C1GGRV_enUS751US751&amp;amp;q=melbourne%20micro%20breweries&amp;amp;npsic=0&amp;amp;rflfq=1&amp;amp;rlha=0&amp;amp;rllag=-37876314,144977068,10910&amp;amp;tbm=lcl&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwii4q2Wm-_bAhVgJDQIHbTPAkQQjGoIZg&amp;amp;tbs=lrf:!2m1!1e2!2m1!1e3!2m1!1e16!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:9&amp;amp;rldoc=1#rlfi=hd:;si:;mv:!1m3!1d148035.92266011552!2d145.08454344999998!3d-37.86729595!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i325!2i282!4f13.1;tbs:lrf:!2m1!1e2!2m1!1e3!2m1!1e16!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:9" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Google lists about 15 craft breweries&lt;/a&gt; in downtown Melbourne. I would have to say that's probably the most up to date list &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Duty-Free shops are placed in such a way that travelers must leave the country of origin (sale). Australia is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Duty-free shops (or stores) are retail outlets that are exempt from the payment of certain local or national taxes and duties, on the requirement that the goods sold will be sold to travelers who will take them out of the country. Which products can be sold duty-free vary by jurisdiction, as well as how they can be sold, and the process of calculating the duty or refunding the duty component. - &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty-free_shop" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Duty-free shop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/118045/42525"&gt;J. Caron&lt;/a&gt; makes this statement about the Sydney airport:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Don’t remember the exact layout in Sydney, but in most airports (if not all), you can’t get to the duty-free shops without going through immigration (where applicable) and security, which you generally won’t be able to do without a boarding pass for a flight.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The shop will also often require to see the boarding pass, and in some places will make a distinction between people travelling domestic or international. In some countries like the US, as there is not necessarily a separation between domestic and international travellers, and you can exit the departures area at will, they will not give you the goods right away, but deliver them during the actual aircraft boarding.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;In some airports (especially in the EU), duty-free shops will actually sell duty-free when they can (you are actually leaving the country, or in the case of the EU, leave the EU customs union), and make a discount equivalent to duty-free for other cases.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have seen duty-free sales of liquor and other items sold on in-flight only on some international flights.&lt;/p&gt;
