					&lt;p&gt;Some of the mocelues in the beer are broken down by ultraviolet  light and bind to sulfur atoms. This causes Skunking. This is why some bottle six packs have a tall sleeve and beer keeps longer in a darker colored bottle. A common misperception is warming and cooling over and over again causes Skunking.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Skunking is a stage in a beer's life in which it goes rancid. It may smell funny, almost like a skunk, and taste bad. As John pointed out, it is generally caused by excess exposure to light. Beers packaged in clear (Corona and Land Shark for instance) or green bottles are particularly susceptible to this. It is best to avoid these kinds of beers to avoid the risk of skunked beer; choose beer bottled in brown bottles or cans, which are less susceptible to light exposure. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Fully attributing &lt;a href="http://www.berghoffbeer.com/blog/"&gt;the Berghoff Beer Blog&lt;/a&gt; for this interesting story (emphasis mine),&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Around World War II, brown glass rose in demand and many companies had to forfeit their brown glass for their country. Unfortunately that meant companies with higher quality beers had to use clear glass, which made their beers look like cheaper, clear glass beers. Higher quality brewers’ solution was to sell their beer in green bottles so a consumer could tell the difference between a regular beer and a higher quality. &lt;strong&gt;The green beer bottle became a status symbol for many European breweries.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;These days, there’s not much of a reason to sell a beer in a green bottle other than for marketing and aesthetic. Many companies use it to distinguish their beer from others. Of course, some beers have used green bottles for so long, it would seem silly to switch to a brown glass now.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucky for us, glass suppliers are able to apply clear, UV protected coats to glass that help keep beer fresh no matter what kind of bottle it is in.&lt;/strong&gt; [...]&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.berghoffbeer.com/blog/what-does-the-color-of-your-beer-bottle-mean/"&gt;http://www.berghoffbeer.com/blog/what-does-the-color-of-your-beer-bottle-mean/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, perhaps it's no longer the case that clear and green bottles are (noticeably) inferior to brown bottles!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Edit: I failed to find historical sources for the above claims, even some indication of higher demand for brown glass during World War II. However, the story seems widely believed today, true or not.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would expect that companies which use clear bottles don't expect their product to see that much sunlight, or that they think their customers won't notice a little skunking if it does see any.  Anecdotally, I typically associate clear bottles with the larger brewers (Coors, Budweiser), and I don't think of those beers as having much in the way of hops, the source of the isohumulones which, when combined with light, create the "skunk".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_bottle#Lightstruck_beer" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; points out something interesting as well:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;In some cases, such as Miller High Life, a hop extract that does not
					  have isohumulones is used to bitter the beer so it cannot be
					  'lightstruck'.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Certain wavelengths of light are responsible for skunking beer. I believe these are mostly in the blue and ultraviolet parts of the spectrum. Brown bottles do the best at blocking out the UV rays. This is why you can get an occasional Rolling Rock that tastes off. I've never heard of a UV reflective coating before, but it makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What follows is probably only relevant if you want to be nit-picky about this:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If it is not in direct sunlight, I'd say your pretty ok. I don't know what your lighting situation is, but I know most incandescent bulbs mostly give off infrared light (I'm not sure if infrared light has been correlated to skunking) and the modern CFL bulbs mostly give off light in the visible spectrum. I'd say both however give off some sort of UV light.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are really concerned, you could tint the cupboard glass. Vehicle window tint is designed to block out UV rays that can damage the interior of cars. Your level of protection depends on how dark you want your tint. If you want the highest protection though, I'd recommend a wooden cupboard.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Go to the store and get Bitburger german pilsner in a can, and in a bottle.  Tell me if you taste a difference.  I tried that and the canned stuff is a heck of a lot better tasting than the skunked stuff in the brown glass bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think for short term storage it shouldn't be a problem. It sounds like you're just keeping the bottles in the cupboard outside their cardboard carriers? You could always use the carriers or keep most in carriers in the back and single bottles in the front if you enjoy the appearance of the bottles. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Samuel Adams' carriers are taller for the exact reason of keeping out light, and they use brown bottles so obviously even with brown bottles light is still of some concern.
					&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					I've usually had a problem with beer tasting off if it goes from a refrigerated state to room temperature and then back in the fridge. I've noticed this happens to me more frequently than anything with light.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;No. They are not sufficient, but are one of several necessary conditions to keep beer from going bad. In general, keep beer at a cool temperature (50-60 degrees), away from light, and stand the bottle up (do not lie them sideways like wine bottles are stored). Brown bottles help keep beer away from light, but as a rule of them, store your beer someplace dark. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is no way to prevent skunking! Except drink it fast and drink it cold;)
