					&lt;h2&gt;The Life of Wine (after opening)&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The short answer is approximately 3-5 days, but it all depends on the type of wine. There are a number of factors at play when it comes to the life of wine, after it has been opened.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These include acetic acid bacteria that consumes the alcohol in wine and metabolizes it into acetic acid and acetaldehyde. This causes the wine to have a sharp, vinegar-like smell.  Additionally, the alcohol can oxidize, causing a nutty, bruised fruit taste, that robs the wine of fresh, fruity flavors. These are both chemical reactions, and so the lower the temperature you keep a wine at, the slower this will happen.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Please see link for full reference and detailed breakdown of How long wine lasts after opening: &lt;a href="http://winefolly.com/tutorial/how-long-opened-wine-lasts/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://winefolly.com/tutorial/how-long-opened-wine-lasts/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes the alcohol cooks off but the flavor is not in the alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you would not drink it then don't cook with it. The flavor of the wine will come through. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For me I do not cook with an expensive full body red as then just too much comes through.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;More about grape and just get a decent wine.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Like Chardonnay with clams you would get some oak coming through with a nicer bottle but I am not going to spend more than $12 on cooking wine.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You don't use that much. You can just use the wine you would pair with the meal. I don't drink much white so I will typically use the wine I am serving with the meal.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A pork chop with onion and peppers I will use a $4 red bottle I would drink.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another trick is if they are starting to go bad then cooking wine. But wine rarely stays around long enough to go bad at my house.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The more expensive bit is not true, but the type of wine does make a dramatic difference to the taste imparted to your food.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As an extreme example compare cooking a steak with a light white wine sauce to cooking it with a heavy Merlot.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Even within a particular grape, there are differences in how full or heavy the taste is.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So don't worry about the price (go for a cheap one) and instead think about what flavours you want to go into your food.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It all depends on what you are making and what you are drinking!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some people reach for the &lt;a href="http://www.foodandwine.com/articles/alexandra-guarnaschellis-tips-on-cooking-with-wine"&gt;cheap bottle&lt;/a&gt; that's in the door of the fridge when making a braise, where the wine will cook for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Others use the &lt;a href="http://www.winemag.com/2007/02/19/cooking-with-wine/"&gt;type of wine&lt;/a&gt; you’d serve with dinner to make the dish. Even better, unless you’re pouring something rare or expensive, buy an extra bottle and cook with it. When you’re cooking with red wine, watch out for tannins. When concentrated in reduction sauces, they can become harsh. Fortunately, proteins found in meat and dairy declaw tannins like milk does tea.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.winemag.com/2007/02/19/cooking-with-wine/"&gt;Wines contains sugars, acids, and tannins,&lt;/a&gt; and each of these will show up on the plate. Subtle characteristics, by contrast, normally disappear with cooking. To maintain balance, check your recipe for acidic ingredients like lemon juice or vinegar and cut back to make room for the acid in the wine. This is especially crucial when cooking with white wine. For delicate fish or vegetables, a dry non-oaked wine works best. If your recipe is packed with onions, carrots and tomatoes, there will be plenty of sugars in the pot, so cooking with a fuller-bodied, less dry red or white wine can integrate perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.winemag.com/2007/02/19/cooking-with-wine/"&gt;For deeper flavors,&lt;/a&gt; experiment with fortified wines like Port, Sherry, Madeira and Marsala. Michael Schachner offers some helpful tips and recipes on cooking with fortified wine in this piece.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-Wine-in-Cooking"&gt;Cook with a wine you would drink.&lt;/a&gt; Do not use a wine to cook if you would never drink it in a glass or serve it with food. •Start with a basic red or white wine. An example of a good white to cook with is Sauvignon Blanc. Try Chianti or Cabernet Sauvignon for a red.
					•Avoid using wines that are labeled "cooking wines." These wines contain a lot of salt and other additives and you would never drink them in a glass.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.matchingfoodandwine.com/news/entertaining/how-to-mull-wine-the-tips-you-need-to-know/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mulled wine&lt;/a&gt; is a seasonal staple but although it's easy to make it's also easy to spoil.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can mull white wine but most people prefer a red. It needs to be inexpensive, obviously, but that doesn’t mean it should be undrinkable so don’t just chuck in the tail ends of bottles you may have hanging round the kitchen. And you don’t want a wine that’s too heavily oaked though that’s relatively unlikely if it’s cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There’s a fair amount of inexpensive own-label Corbières I’ve noticed lately which would fit the bill perfectly or try a basic Portuguese red. Most recipes add water as well which brings down the cost and stops guests getting too plastered but adjust the amount to the strength of your wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Whole spices work better than ground ones otherwise you can get an unpleasant powdery sensation as you drink. Cinnamon is probably the most popular spice but you could also use cloves, cardamom (lightly crush a few pods) ginger and nutmeg. Some recommend star anise but use sparingly if you don't want your mulled wine to taste of aniseed. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most recipes call for sugar but you might want to add a little less than they suggest if your wine is particularly soft and fruity or if you add port."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally, I am very fond of cinnamon in my mulled wines at Christmas time. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wines.com/blog/classic-american-wine-pairings/" rel="nofollow"&gt;From Classic American Steak and Wine Pairings.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Wines to Drink with Steak&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cabernet Sauvignon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"The king of red wines, Cabernet Sauvignon is often the number one choice for steak and wine pairings. Beef steak has lots of strong flavor from the meat itself and from smoke, marinade, sauce, or pepper, so it calls for choosing a wine that is also full-bodied. Cabernet Sauvignon’s robust fruit tastes and powerful flavors can stand up to most any steak. The tannins in Cabernet Sauvignon (coming mainly from the red skin of the grape)  and relatively high alcohol levels also help cut through the fat of the steak, making the wine taste smoother and less bitter… and the steak more flavorful."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;California Zinfandel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"Zinfandel has moderate tannins and high acidity, making it a fitting match with steaks that contain relatively good amounts of fat. Rib Eye, T-Bone or Porterhouse steaks are ideal partners for Zinfandel. A little less refined than  Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel has a characteristically bold grapey spiciness and thick richness on the pallet."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malbec&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"Malbec is an up and coming red wine that is definitely steak friendly. In fact, Malbec is the number one consumed red wine in Argentina where it’s considered the ideal wine to pair with beef.  Malbec is a versatile, rich and food-friendly red wine that may break with tradition but won’t break the bank. Check out Malbec wines from Argentina or Chile. You won’t be disappointed." &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Good Red Wine Pairings with Steak&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"The classic wine choices to pair with grilled steaks are big, bold red wines, especially California Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec.  Merlot, Syrah (Shiraz from Australia), Sangiovese, Chianti and Pinot Noir are also good choices and will produce softer red wine and steak pairings, which you may prefer depending on the steak, the doneness you prefer and whatever else you are serving."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosés, Blush Wine and Sparkling Wines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"Not to be forgotten, a crisp chilled Rosé wine or a bubbly Sparkling Wine (especially brut or rosé) is  almost always an enjoyable pairing with steak and other grilled fare. Just be sure to chill them in the refrigerator or on ice for several hours before serving. In fact, we recommend also chilling your red wines to avoid any “hot wine” influence on the taste of the steaks."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Romans learned their love of wines from the Greeks. In fact Greek wine was highly praised by the Romans and incorporated viticulture into their own culture, thanks to the Greeks. The white  &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retsina" rel="nofollow"&gt;Retsina&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resinated_wine" rel="nofollow"&gt;Resinated wine&lt;/a&gt; of the ancient Greeks is still produced in Greece and is locally very popular. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a few wineries in Europe, notable Italy that make a claim (loosely) of producing a truly &lt;strong&gt;Roman wine&lt;/strong&gt;, but interpretation is still left to the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First of all, there is the &lt;a href="http://winefolly.com/update/drink-like-true-roman-wine-lazio/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cesanese Wine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Cesanese could have been the local wine of ancient Rome.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•It’s quite possible that Cesanese was the red wine of ancient Rome because the grape is quite old and existed in the region during pre-Roman times.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•However, there is no physical records to prove this, just ampelography (the study of grapes).&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Evidence of Cesanese dates back to the 1400s from agricultural contracts that were preserved in local monasteries.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•There are only about 1500 acres of Cesanese vineyards left around Rome and the province of Frosinone in Lazio, Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A second possibility is &lt;a href="http://www.intowine.com/frascati-wine-when-rome-drink-what-romans-drink" rel="nofollow"&gt;Frascati Wine&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The Romans referred to it as the Golden Wine both for its color and its value.  It has become embedded in the cultural and economic traditions of the city.  In fact, in 1450, there were 1,022 taverns in Rome.  Producers of Frascati owned almost all of the taverns.  It has been said that Frascati is the most often mentioned wine in Italian literature.  Pope Gregori XVI, in the first part of the 18th century, said it was his favorite wine.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The wines made in close proximity to Rome are collectively known as Castelli Romani, nine communes that produce wine in the Alban Hills, which are just south of Rome.  The vineyards range from 200 to 1,000 feet in altitude.  The Soils are well drained and volcanic.  The Mediterranean provides some influence but the climate is more affected by the hills.  Of these, Frascati is the most famous.  It has historically had a widespread reputation as an inexpensive and serviceable white wine served in the cafés of Rome.  The potential, however, is there to really improve the wines.  &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tourelles.com/spip.php?article116" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mas des Tourelles&lt;/a&gt; offers some unique &lt;strong&gt;“Archeological Roman Wines”&lt;/strong&gt;:  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;These wines are only available in France (and in few quantities in Germany).
					   As many people contacted us to have informations on the way to buy and taste these wines in the US, you should know that it is hard to export wines without having a registered importer. It need also that this company can after deal with a reseller that can work with all the states.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mulsum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Like testifying the passages of Pline the eldest, the blend of wine, honey and a certain number of plants ans spices (cinnamon, pepper, thyme ect...) are usedin making this famous wine, which was often served to the « gustatio » (before the meal as an aperitif).&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;However, it also accompanies filet of duck with figs, small quails with grapes and pine kernels, very spicy dishes, Roquefort or chocolate fondant. To serve at 14°.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turriculae&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Made exactly according to the writings of Lucius Columelle, it displays the tastes of the Romans as far as dry wine is concerned. The addition of seawater, fenugrec, defrutum (grape juice concentrated to boiling point) ect..., during the vinification makes an amazing and complex wine. Roman dishes, such as oysters ans smoked fish, are wonderful with our wines of recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;However, in the years of 2746 - 2747, you will be able to serve it with fried foie gras or cakes with nuts. To serve at 18°. « The fenugrec confers it to the particular « vin Jaune » taste and it has a detectable smell due to the notes of nuts and almonds. The taste of the Turriculae proves to be rich and supple with a round prune flavoured finish.
					   (La Revue des Vins de France - Mai 1999)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carenum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;This sweet wine, described by Palladius, is produced by fermenting very mature grapes with plants, quince and defrutum. A delicately viscous and silky wine notes of quince and subtle aromas of crystallised peaches, it is a wonderful accompaniment with “foie gras” and fruit tarts.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;To serve at 14°. « The wine is of an amber colour, and its smell hesitates between peach and caramel. These smoky and caramel notes are also present in its mellowt taste. It makes a very nice aperitif ».
					   (La revue des Vins de France - Mai 1999)&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To make things a little more interesting it could be noted that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/22/italy-wine-archaeology" rel="nofollow"&gt;Italian Scientists have planted vineyards with the aim of making wine using techniques from classical Rome described by Virgil.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Archeologists in Italy have set about making red wine exactly as the ancient Romans did, to see what it tastes like.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;At the group's vineyard, which should produce 70 litres at the first harvest, modern chemicals will be banned and vines will be planted using wooden Roman tools and will be fastened with canes and broom, as the Romans did.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Instead of fermenting in barrels, the wine will be placed in large terracotta pots – traditionally big enough to hold a man – which are buried to the neck in the ground, lined inside with beeswax to make them impermeable and left open during fermentation before being sealed shut with clay or resin.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is no &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt; for any bottle of wine. You can open it and it has gone bad.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Good is subjective.  Well flavored is subjective.  Flavor is more about the grape.  If you don't like a Cabernet Sauvignon then you are not going to like an expensive Cabernet Sauvignon.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are numerous reviews and point systems.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A vineyard will have a reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The wine buyer at the store has the reputation of the store to protect.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Restaurants will sample the wine before putting it on the menu.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes wine snobs know the difference and they LOVE to talk about wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are not a wine connoisseur you might not know the difference between a $40 and $400.  But you would probably prefer the $40 over over the $4 of the same grape.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In a free market supply and demand establish the price and wine is a liquid (that is an economics term) commodity.  Even a small run will have a set of knowledgeable buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes they may have just slapped a price on it as a marketing ploy. Does not mean the market will bite. For sure you don't need to bite. There are many reviews available. If you want to get into higher priced wines then find  reviewers / publications you trust.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are many wines which are for sale at many thousands of pounds/dollars that no-one will ever drink, and that are not expected to have a good taste at all - they are simply priced there through scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A rare item is going to demand a higher price from an interested buyer than a commodity item.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While I may be able to tell the difference between a £10 bottle and a £200 bottle, I may in many cases prefer the £10 (and this has proved to be the case often enough that when I used to sell wines I used to sell based on what the customer liked previously, &lt;strong&gt;Not&lt;/strong&gt; some description of the nose and palate that is upwards of 50% subjective and arbitrary)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Upwards of £200 there is almost no quality/taste difference, and upwards of £1000 the customer is solely paying for exclusivity, and the opportunity to drink or offer a glass no-one else can, or just to hold it as an investment.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the aerator top is still working, meaning that no air has gotten to the wine, you should still be able to bottle it. The best way to know is to taste it. If it tastes right, you should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for butter  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Many white wines undergo a process that causes them to take on buttery flavors (which sometimes come across as buttered popcorn or even butterscotch).  That process is called malo-lactic fermentation, and here's the quick take on how it works.  Just after the grapes are made into wine, a special type of beneficial bacteria is added to the wine.  That bacteria converts one of the acids in wine (malic) to another type of acid (lactic).  The two acids feel different on the tongue.  Malic acid is very sharp (it's the acid in a Granny Smith apple); lactic acid is fairly soft (it's the acid in milk).  Most Chardonnay's go through malo-lactic fermentation and are therefore soft and buttery. (Taken from &lt;a href="http://www.blueskyvineyard.com/why-do-wines-taste-buttery" rel="nofollow"&gt;Why Do Wines Taste Buttery?).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are several categories of organic compounds that are responsible for aromas - esters, ketones, and aldehydes are the most notable.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Esters are formed when an alcohol and an acid combine; creating esters is a common laboratory experiment in high-school chemistry - I remember making peppermint and banana.  This is the actual compound responsible for making peppermint smell like peppermint; the way we synthesized it in the lab isn't necessarily the way the peppermint plant makes it, but the result is identical.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A similar process happens during fermentation and aging of wine: the acids and alcohols present combine to form the compound that makes a cherry smell like a cherry, a thyme sprig smell like thyme, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Just to be clear, most fermented beverages are going to have some of these aroma compounds as byproducts of fermentation.  But grapes are notable in that they produce many more different acids than other fruits.  So the range of possible aroma compounds is greater in wine than in, for example, cider - since apples don't have the variety of acids that grapes do, and can't make as many different esters.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would spend your limited time and money just tasting wines from one region.  &lt;strong&gt;Nahe&lt;/strong&gt; is a smaller wine region just west of Frankfurt, and I've found the wines there to be good quality, with individual charm (in other words, without the sense that they are mass-produced).  &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahe_(wine_region)" rel="nofollow"&gt;More info here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;By all means, talk to locals: the people you're visiting, the clerk in your hotel.  That's almost always a great way to discover something.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For me, the most important thing to select the wine I like/dislike is &lt;strong&gt;grape variety&lt;/strong&gt;. You'll have to do some research and try some different grapes in order to know what you like and dislike.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Country and region&lt;/strong&gt; can also have an influence. You'll also need to do some research for this.
					For myself, I don't really like Bordeaux and Italian wines.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So you'll have som tasting to do. Try to write down what you liked and what you didn't like and it'll become clear what you're favourite style might be.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;1) Take a wine-tasting course. You will learn how different foods affect the flavour of wines. It really does make a difference (you will be astonished). You will also (hopefully) learn how to analyse wines (without being pretentious) and make useful notes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;2) Travel. Travel as much as you can and drink the local wines. If you find something that you really like and can afford to buy some, do so. You will never find your "favourite wine" by working your way systematically through your local wine shop.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;3) Remember that wines change. One of the best wines that I ever tasted was a certain 1996 Amarone (Recioto della Valpolicella), and I was fortunate enough to be able to buy a case of it. However, once it was gone, it was gone. Later vintages (from the same producer) were not nearly as good.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;4) Time passes. The wines that you love will be associated with treasured memories and inevitably belong to the past. You can never step into the same river twice. Such is the beauty of wine (and life).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think you have to be able to find the wine that best matches your tastes. it took me several months to sample different types of different regions. I am Italian, and here we assure you that there are many varieties of wines. I did courses, I just chose what I liked best. in my case my favorite wine is Amarone! we are not made equal, then a wine that you can enjoy, for others maybe not enthuse. I apologize for the translation from Italian to English, they are not very good! I hope to been helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Make a &lt;a href="http://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/kir-royale"&gt;kir royale&lt;/a&gt; with it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Add a small amount of a strong, fruity liqueur to the bottom of the glass, such as creme de cassis or framboise (Chambord is one brand name).  Then gently add the sparkling wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Often, cheap sparkling wine is not very palatable because it is bitter: the strong fruit flavors of the liqueur will mask this.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your biggest worry with an open fermentor is contamination. 
					If you've added potassium or sodium metabisulfide to the wine must, you should be safe against most wine spoiling bacteria.  However, it is advisable to cover the fermentation vessel.  See &lt;a href="https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/2199/open-fermentation-process"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; about open fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I always cover with a tea towel and tie it round the rim with string, still allows it to breathe and fights off nearly all air borne infections. You are right about the fact fermentation will be faster with the lid open, be wary of the fact it can happen to fast - if its bubbling a lot then you would be better to decrease the heat that the pan is sitting on, be that a heat mat or a floor. Happy brewing!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Why, a Buck's Fiz, of course! Two parts chilled Champagne (recommend a NV from a non-&lt;em&gt;Grandes Marques&lt;/em&gt; Champagne house) or bubbly (chilled white sparkling wine that isn't from the Champagne region) to one part freshly squeezed orange juice from oranges stored in a fridge. This is a British idea, one that is traditionally served mid-morning or even as a chaser to a good cooked breakfast with top-notch ingredients! A Christmas morning indulgence or as a libation to kick off the day on any other celebratory occasion. What's not to enjoy about that, then?  (Wikipedia)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Mint extract and mint oil won't do the same thing as leaves, not exactly. The flavor is different. If you infuse it with mint leaves, the flavor can have a more "leafy" or herbal quality, not necessarily a good thing. And infusions can change the color of your liquor, which if you're drinking it straight is not ideal. For these reasons, I'd use extract. It's also cheaper than oil, more shelf stable, and it's less concentrated which makes it easier to adjust how minty your hooch is. Just add it at the end when the kilju is finished and filtered. You can consider using peppermint extract instead of mint, which is usually a combination of peppermint and spearmint. And you might want to add a little simple syrup too.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I was a professional wine maker for a few years. We always used open top fermenters on our red wines when they were fermenting on the skins, we just threw sheets or blankets over them to keep the bugs out. Of course we are talking about tons of grapes at a time. White wines you could do this too, but I would only as long as there is active fermentation and enough CO2 to keep the oxygen out. But for white wines we had a closed lid with way for the CO2 to escape easily. Sulfites will be blown out with an active fermentation so they are pretty useless while fermenting, but they need to be added as soon as fermentation is done. As long as there is active fermentation, it is very hard to oxidize your wine as most of the oxygen will be consumed by the yeast.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I agree that making kyr royale is a good solution.
					Also putting some fresh and perfumed herbs in it will help. Try Lemon Balm or others that you like. Put the wine in a carafe together with some bundles of leaves, leave it in the fridge for 30 min.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I dug into their website and they are moving away from the Cava distinction because it is associated with cheap sparkling wine and they want to go higher end. They could call it Cava but choose not too. I would put this wine at the same level as a nice Champagne. Looks like a really nice bottle of wine!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you dig further on their website, you'll read this: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;In 1888, Manuel Raventós Doménech created a sparkling wine in Penedés with three native varieties: Xarel•lo, Macabeu and Parellada.
					  When we created CAVA in 1872, we dreamed of a World Class sparkling wine. This is why Josep Raventós Fatjó decided to innovate with Xarel.lo from the same vineyard where de la Finca comes from to this day. He understood the great potential of this grape, the mineral structure of our oldest soils and, most importantly, that to become World Class you have to be AUTHENTIC.
					  &lt;strong&gt;After 150 years CAVA has become a volume-oriented DO lacking geographical distinction in terms of climate and terroir; it also suffers from low viticultural standards.... For this reason, in November 2012 we decided to leave the CAVA DO.&lt;/strong&gt;
					  We believe that we need to create a LOCAL, VITICULTURALLYORIENTED DO with strict controls in order to showcase our wines and help them to be better understood worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					  &lt;p&gt;The earliest reference to Epiphany as a Christian feast was in A.D. 361, by Ammianus Marcellinus.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, it would be pertinent to drink wines made from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_wine#Italian_grape_varieties" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Italian grapes&lt;/a&gt; since the feast was held within the time of the Roman Empire.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;More particularly, you might pick a grape variety from &lt;a href="http://www.unrv.com/economy/wine-chart.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;a list of ancient grapes&lt;/a&gt; from which the Romans, themselves, would have made wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not that it's entirely pertinent to the Feast of Epiphany, but it is apt to say here that, you might purchase your wine here: &lt;a href="https://www.epiphanywineco.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.epiphanywineco.com/&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as my quick and limited research has gone, there really isn't an 'official' wine of the feast - not really a Christian concept to have "official alcoholic beverages," imho.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as local traditions, the wiki you linked covers the traditions of the feast internationally but again, alcohol consumption doesn't really ever seem to be the focus...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, let's not forget that the Roman's would have had beer at this feast...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;All wine that you want to age for a long time should be kept at the same temperature. The difference in temperatures come when you want to serve the wine. White should be served at a lower temperature than cellar temperature. Red wine, ideally, should be served at cellar temperature. What is the ideal cellar temperature? That is open to debate, but somewhere in the low 50s Fahrenheit (about 11-12 C). Humidity should be kept constant around 75% but there is no evidence you need to keep the humidity that high. You do not want to keep it at an excessively low humidity. You are trying to make sure the corks don't dry out which can cause wine leaking around the cork. You also want as little light and vibration as possible. Think of a cave as your ideal storage facility. You can read the Wikipedia article about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_of_wine" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wine Storage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is nothing called "Zinbardel". The only thing close is Zinfandel. Just in case I was missing something I did a google search on ZinBARdel and it had only 6 results. One of them was your question! Now if you are talking about ZinFANdel, all you have to do is go to your closest supermarket and buy a jug of Gallo Zinfandel.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2014/04/charcuterie-pairing-spirits-cocktails-advice-jeff-faile-partisan-dc.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;This link&lt;/a&gt; has decent information on pairing spirits. The problem for giving generalizations becomes differences in palate. Most people don't pair straight spirits with foods as most (self injected word) people reading websites for pairings drink spirits in "cocktail" format.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Information from the website includes:  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RYE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Faile recommends pouring rye to cut through the high fat content of fattier charcuterie options. "The tannins and natural spices come through in a rye," he explains, "and a higher proof (100 or higher) is perfect for complementing something fatty and smoked."&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOURBON&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;bourbon naturally complements smoky flavors, but the added dimension of sweetness can come in handy. "Bourbons pair with the same principle as spicy foods paired with Riesling," says Faile. "The sweetness of the bourbon tempers the heat from spice so the heat does not become the only note. A wheated bourbon coats the tongue to allow the spice to come through with each bite rather than building up." &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCOTCH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"The peatiness of Scotch makes it a perfect match for smoked meats, " says Anda. "German style sausages, like landjäger, are great with Scotch because they're smoked with immense depth of flavor and not overly fatty."&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;But finding the right charcuterie match can be a bit of a moving target depending on how the spirit is finished. A sherry-barrel aged Scotch like Bowmore 15, accents peat flavors with a sweetness that Faile says can be great with saltier charcuterie.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GIN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"Being all herbal and floral," Faile explains, "gin doesn't require fat to balance its flavors." Instead, the charcuterie flavors to look for when thinking of pairings for gin, says Faile, "are botanical more than fat." Herbs like fennel and thyme are key points for pairing. "Porchetta's are often seasoned with fennel and citrus," Anda says, pointing to one delicious option. Anda also recommends duck prosciutto, which he describes as more oily than fatty and is often cured with herbs, or a finocchiona, a fennel salami&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMARO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Along the same lines as gin, amaro's earthy, herbaceous, and citrus qualities give it pairing versatility. Faile recommends trying earthy Averna with a liverwurst, or herbaceous Fernet with a bresaola or speck. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Chaptilization is the addition of sugar, mostly cane sugar but could be other sugars like beet or corn. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Chaptilization is only illegal in several countries and one state in the USA. Here is the list Australia, Austria, Germany (for high quality wines), Italy and South Africa. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Chaptilization is permitted in only certain areas of France. Those are Bordeaux, Burgundy, Alsace and Champagne. There is no need in warmer climates where the grapes get higher brix (sugar levels)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;No it's not dangerous to consume chaptilized wine. The main reason is to bring a wine up to around 11-12 potential alcohol so the wine is stable and in balance. Cool climate places like Germany and France routinely have under ripe grapes and sometimes need a little help getting across the finish line. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If done in moderation, all the sugar added will be consumed by yeast and turned into alcohol. I suppose you could go crazy and make a wine with so much sugar it wouldn't finish fermenting. Some people swear they can tell when a wine has added sugar, but as far as I know, nobody can really tell by tasting if done in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Why is it banned in the warmer places like California, Australia and South Africa? There simply isn't a need. The grapes get ripe on their own. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is one big loophole to get around this, you can use grape juice concentrate to give you an added boost if you are in bad (cool) year. But for the most part if you are looking at a crappy and cool year, say in California, you might just buy grapes from a warmer location and do some blending.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaptalization" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Chaptilization on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The primary effect a spitoon would have, is less alcohol recpetion (some alcohol will get into the blood via the mouth-mucus). The alcohol could lead to different results for the later wines. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You might get a more intense taste of the wine if you could take more of it into your mouth and "wash" with it. Even more if you take a sip, wash, gulp/spit, take another sip and taste.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Maybe you want to try it, when you drink a glass of wine next time and then decide if the bigger sips / double sipping makes a difference to you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If it does but you dislike the idea of a spitoon, try reducing the number of wines per evening, so the increasing intoxication is not a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I really like your version of private tastings and might adopt some ideas from it. Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's fairly common in the wine trade to spit wine when evaluating wine as a buyer, winemaker, sommelier because you will get trashed if you drank everything.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So there are two ways to spit. There is the common spit "bucket" and the paper coffee cup methods. When I taught at our local community college, they had every student spit wine into white paper coffee cups. Some people don't want to touch a common spit bucket and not everyone one is good at spitting with precision, so I recommend the coffee cup approach for beginners. You should see real professionals, they can spit into a bucket from 20 feet!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is a technique to it that takes a little bit of mastery so you don't end up dribbling wine all down your chin and clothes, but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The most romantic thing is to conform to the desires of your companion. It sounds like there are specific problems with sparkling and red wine. Personally as much as I like beer, I don't think it is "romantic" with the possible exception of a Belgium Tripel. These taste great, are surprisingly alcoholic and look neat served in the appropriate glass (a large wine glass may suffice). What I do think might be fun is a good French rose (a sparkling rose is really romantic, but out). Otherwise investigate cocktails. Unfortunately, I not much of a cocktail guy so I don't have any suggestions. Googling "romantic cocktails" provides a lot of hits.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's unclear what the restrictions are so i have to guess.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So how about highballs/longdrinks? If you are easy on the spirits it should be possible to drink them as beverages.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What might be a nice companion to food (depends on the food and your taste) as it's not too sweet and not to much alcohol: Lillet (white vermouth) and Wild Berry (Schweppes). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Margaritas are also common during dinner, but that might be a problem as you're on a boat.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Coke &amp;amp; rum, vodka &amp;amp; orange-juice, gin &amp;amp; tonic might also work.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Isn't Saint Valentine Irish? I would be drinking a Guinness then! Oh, but you asked for wine... You could celebrate with the blood of Christ and drink a nice Italian Red Wine, like a nice aged &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarone" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Amarone&lt;/a&gt;.

					&lt;p&gt;As you're planning well ahead, good man, I'd suggest you pair your celebration with the Umbria, as he was Valentinus of Terni, in central Italy. Poor man, bits of him, his relics, are in churches all over, in Dublin, as well as in Rome and Savona, Madrid, Prague, Vienna, Birmingham, Glasgow, Malta, Greece, and France.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Umbrian truffi, truffles, suggests strangozzi (pasta) with black truffles, paired with Montefalco Sagrantino, or gallina ubriaca, drunken hen, a chicken cooked wine; cook it in Montefalco Rosso and, what else, pair it Montefalco Rosso (after all, you don't want to cook with a wine you wouldn't drink).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And then there's Perugia, the capitol of Umbria, and Perugina Baci, kisses, chocolate, how appropriate. Pair that with an Orvieto Classico or Grechetto Bianco. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Well, Champagne has to come from Champagne and has made out of a combination of 3 grapes (Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier or Chardonnay) and made using the Méthode Champenoise techniques. They think this truly reflects the terroir of the Champagne region. They were one of the first to assert their regional identity around the world by enforcing their region name as almost a trademark. They forced Californians to stop using the the word Champagne when they make sparkling wines (ok there exceptions from before the treaty was signed)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Cava just like Champagne is tightly regulated. It has to be made in a certain place with certain grapes and with certain methods (Méthode Champenoise again). Again, Cava is supposed to reflect the Terroir of the place it's made (Mostly Catalonia). Cava can be as expensive as good Champagne. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Both regions make excellent sparkling wine. Can you tell the difference? Probably not to the untrained palate. I think even I would have a difficulty telling the difference between a high end Cava and Champagne. The only way you'll know is to start buying and tasting!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am always looking to pair the best wine with my meal and I have a book 
					"What to Drink with What you Eat". It pairs wine with food - and a separate section -food with wine.  That is a list of every imaginable dish and pairs a wine with it.  The it lists all varieties of wine and then pairs a dish with it.  I have never looked for a paring when either the dish or the  wine wasn't listed.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Example:  Fried Chicken - KFC -Pinot Noir. Popeye's -Sherry&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Over 10 pages of different cheeses with individual wine pairings.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It also lists other beverages like Tea, Beer , Coctails etc  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I can answer this... once you get above about $20 a bottle is not proportional to the value you get out of it. The flavors/tastes simply don't give you the value above that range. A $100 or $1000 bottle of wine starts to get into &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;veblen goods&lt;/a&gt; territory. Production costs simply stop contributing to the price on the self above this point. I've tasted several 100 point rated wines and thought where is the emperors new clothes!?!? OK, have tasted one wine that was $10000 a bottle and 230 years old from Madeira that absolutely blew my socks off but those are rare. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Veblen Goods from Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;A price increase may increase that high status and perception of exclusivity, thereby making the good even more preferable. At the other end of the spectrum, with luxury items priced equal to non-luxury items of lower quality, all else being equal more people would buy the luxury items, even though a few Veblen-seekers would not. Thus, even a Veblen good is subject to the dictum that demand moves conversely to price, although the response of demand to price is not consistent at all points on the demand curve.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Oh... something I am a real expert at! You are mixing your context when calling vines hybrids. There are three ways you can grow grapes for fruit. 100% original "own rooted" vines, grafted vines and hybridized vines. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Let's back up so I can explain why that is. Many Americans in the 1600-1800s tried unsuccessfully to bring European vines to North America and they always died within a few years and they could never figure out. When American vines were brought to France in the 1860s to study the differences between American and European vines, they inadvertently brought a root louse called phylloxera with them in the soil (they also brought over powdery mildew, but that's another story). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As it came to be, phylloxera completely wiped out most vineyards in Europe within a decade or so. Then started a race to figure out a "cure" for this bug. Three methods were attempted. The first was to drown the soil in chemicals to kill the bugs and that worked for a long time. Some vineyards were still operating like that until the 1960s. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;After more research, they figured out that American vines were resistant to phylloxera. So that led to the other two ways of keeping their vines alive. Hybridization between French and American vines. These hybrids were resistant and yet made drinkable wine. Not the same quality as 100% vitis vinifera but hey it got you tipsy just like a good Cabernet did. Many of these hybrids are still around. I have grown several of them. One that I liked a lot is called Leon Millot. The French after WWII, in a fit of purity, have banned most of these grapes and had them ripped out.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The third way was considered the best way to preserve the flavors of the cabernets and chardonnays of the world. They took a page from the apple growing industry, which had already perfected the art of grafting roots onto a different tree. So, they grafted American vines onto French (and German and Italian and so on) vines. This worked out almost perfectly for everyone. In fact, because they use several different vitis species (there is only one vitis species in Europe, vitis vinifera) they were able to more tightly control how the vines grow. This saved the wine industry around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are only several small pockets and one large one, where phylloxera hasn't invaded. The big one is Washington State in the Northwest corner of the United States. This is where I live. Because of the unique soils (very sandy) and climate (basically a desert) they can grow "own rooted" vines. So, if you are in a place where you can buy a Washington State wine, you are tasting the last place on earth where European vines are grown on their own roots.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Can you taste a difference? I would say not really. There are so many factors that come into play when making a wine. Any subtle influences the own rooted vs. rootstock play in flavor is masked by things like oak, climate, yeast and so on. Just be happy there is a place in the world that phylloxera has not invaded! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Certainly as many goods there is diminishing return.    &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wines between $10 - $20 is a narrow range.  If you are happy in that range then no reason to get outside that range.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I find many wines under $10 I consider drinkable.  Under $10 you will also get more variation from bottle to bottle.  They are often just buying grapes in bulk.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are many wines in the $20 - $30 range that are what I call no regrets wines.  Even if I was very rich those would still be my daily drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A lot is the grape:  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;A pinot nior you need to get close to $20 as it is low yield grape&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;A malbec I don't spend more than $12  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;An old vine zinfindal then need to get into $40 range or I would
					rather just drink a $20 merlot&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;An $80 wine is certainly not twice as good a $40 but there are people with the budget for $80+ wine. Most people can find a lot of good wines in the $4 - $40 range that fit their taste.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not sure if it is true but Kevin O'Leary on Shark Tank says 90% of wine sold is $13 or less a bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I cannot speak for the canadian market, as i do not live here, but in France  we have quite a large choice, and were bottle rank from 5€ to 200€ in a good wine shop.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Assuming there is little return threshold on wine above $20 is, in my humble opinion, a mistake. Because &lt;strong&gt;you don't drink a price, but a work&lt;/strong&gt;. And good work is never cheap.
					I'm not talking about marketing, a wine harvested by a dwarf  wrapped in ham on a full moon night before sorting the grape on the tights of virgins ... but about solid facts.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You might consider this :&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Producer choices&lt;/strong&gt; Above everything, a wine producer is a skilled craftman whom makes soil, cultivation,  harvesting, ageing choices, to make the wine that fits his objectives. Whereas some may aim for low quality high quantity, a great number intend to make the best price over quality wine. And those choices can be expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weather&lt;/strong&gt; It's plain stupid, but a wine is also a product of rains, snow, temperatures, insects, sickness ... production is random. Of course, you can add water, persticides, fertilizers, use UV light by night and cloudy days. But it'll not taste the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soil&amp;amp;terroir&lt;/strong&gt; Good soil is rare, and what is rare is expensive. Right terroir also is. Vine don't grow everywhere, and some places are better than other. And as those lands are rare ... Keep in mind that a century old vineyard and a ten years old one doesn't make the same grapes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breeding&lt;/strong&gt; An industrial wine in steel cask doesn't age and develops flavor the same than in a concrete tank or wood barrel. A wine in a cellar doesn't age like one in estufagem. A wine draught too young will never be good. Don't forget that Pinot Noir, only vines allowed in Burgundy has to age two years in oak barrel and three years in bottle before being opened ? Or that a third of a Savagnin wine barrel evaporate in oxydation to get the taste right ? Well, the producer also has return treshold concerns ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harvesting&lt;/strong&gt; If the harvest is machine made, it's cheap, but immature or rotten grapes go to the pressoir. If it's hand made, it's expensive, but the grapes (and sometimes, every single seed) are harvested the right day : not before, not after. And even after harvest, not everything proceeds to the pressoir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legal or crafting obligations&lt;/strong&gt; In several places in Europe, traditions, rules, even laws determines quality standard. &lt;em&gt;When only the upper two third of an harvest can be made into wine, and the worst third can only be transformed into other products, it has a cost. In France, you cannot put wood dust in your wine to flavour it woody. If you want the wood tastes, you get wood barrel. End of discussion. Adding sugar is restricted. You don't add brandy to cut fermentation. You don't add other fruits. In fact ... it must be 99.9% wine and 0.1% preservatives. If it needs something else than grapes, it's no wine. It's not a moral statement : it just simply isn't wine anymore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glass&lt;/strong&gt;. Is your glass suited for the wine, and its degustation ? It's a common mistake, but there are three kind of glasses : 1/ &lt;a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verre_%C3%A0_vin#D.C3.A9gustation_professionnelle" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;degustation&lt;/a&gt;, standardized to test several wine in same objective conditions 2/ figured : you don't drink Pils, Stout, IPA and Weizenbock in the same beerglass do you ; It does also apply to wine, old&amp;amp;young, white&amp;amp;red does not required the same shape 3/ fancy bullshit. Sorry you bought them. And it's  common in restaurant to have the wrong kind of glass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pairing&lt;/strong&gt; Not every wine fits every dish. Not every wine fits every time of day. Not every wine meets your mood at a precise time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your tastes&lt;/strong&gt; I'm rude, but do you know what you like ? I'm fond of oxydated wines. Most drinkers can't bear them. I don't enjoy champagne. Most drinkers swear by it. You might not have met what you like, and thus you might not know enough in oenology to assess nor appreciate the subtleties. It's easy to learn (if you have a good teacher), but it takes time. I do not buy expensive wines. Because i'm broke. And because i cannot enjoy them fully : i learn and wait until i'm able to enjoy them &lt;em&gt;When i got my drivers licence, i drived a car older than i was. Today i can ride a common sports car. But i would not dare to drive a Porsche or a Ferrari : i would do nothing but find the nearest wall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I might expose twenty other factors that determines both price and quality.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are great wines under 10€. Really ! Simple and straightforwards.
					There are awful wines over 20€. Really ! Miscrafted, mishandled ...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, please, step over your range boundaries. The threshold you wonder is several rung above the price's ladder ! Ask oenologists, do visit wine trade fair, try to meet producers ... or simply visit a true cellarman in his shop. It'll blow your tastebuds !&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Source : my experience as beer cellarman for the importance of the crafting. And several hundred different wine bottle over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, if you bought it in a specialized shop, a cellar, do contact the seller.
					He might do some gesture, and it's an important information for him, if he has other in stock.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Make sure you use the right &lt;a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire-bouchon" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;kind of corckscew&lt;/a&gt; : it shall have a &lt;a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire-bouchon#/media/File:Korkenzieher_01_KMJ.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;pigtail shape&lt;/a&gt; instead of a straight one. This way it'll apply the torque and the pulling force more even on the wood, and shall have less accident. You may also try for a twin-prong cork puller, where blunt blade are pushed between cork and glass. They do even less damage to the cork.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Corks aren't suppose to live eternally : it's not unusual for bottle above twenty years to have some defect. 2004 is a bit early, but you might get the monday morning cork ...
					In fact, some cellarmen changes corks every decades to make sure nothing dreadful happens.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You should at least taste it. If it has spoiled, you'll definitly know it in a few second ... and even before you take a sip, if you are careful to the scent.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;If it has gone bad ... well, make vinegar from it if you can't get help from the seller.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;If it has lost some flavour but you still enjoy the taste ... well enjoy your wine !&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;If it tastes perfect ... why should you worry ? Any kind of rubbish that could have been dangerous was put inside the wine before it has been draught from the cask. The corks only let a little osmosis with oxygen over the years.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I do have a very few 1988 bordeaux with this problem. Nothing different with the "healthy corks"ones.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Kaldui.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;li&gt;The best way to take out bad corks is with an Ah So. Keeps the crumbly corks together better. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pjgd8.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pjgd8.jpg" alt="Ah So cork puller"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Instead of picking at the cork, push it back into the bottle and then strain the wine through a stainless steel tea strainer like this:&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xCAyw.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xCAyw.jpg" alt="tea strainer"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Many times the wine is good, but when the cork is that bad it's probably oxidized to hell, vinegar or corked. The only way to tell is to smell and/or taste it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would say yes and no... I was reading "&lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0671687026" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Vintage&lt;/a&gt;" by Hugh Johnson. It's out of print, but you can find it on Alibris. I highly recommend it if you want to read the history of wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the De Re Rustica chapter about Roman wine, he talks about the very highest quality wine called Falernian he says: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;It is surprising to learn that all of them were white wines - until you also learn that they were all sweet. The tast of the Augustan age (27bc - 14 ad) was for wine that was sweet and strong, and very often cooked in much the same way as madeira is today. Usually it was drunk diluted with warm water or even seawater. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wine did not last that long back then. They kept it in Amphora and it probably had to be drunk within the year after picking before it turned to vinegar.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is a lot more in the chapter about how cheaper wines they added flavorings like herbs, spices and resins. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, my answer is to seek out a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retsina" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Retsina&lt;/a&gt; from Greece. Retsina, is a sweet, strong white wine made with pine resin. This is probably the closest you are going to get to a wine that was made 2000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;How about &lt;strong&gt;Marawi Wine&lt;/strong&gt; from the Recanati Winery in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The wine, called marawi and released last month by Recanati Winery, is the first commercially produced by Israel’s growing modern industry from indigenous grapes. It grew out of a groundbreaking project at Ariel University in the occupied West Bank that aims to use DNA testing to identify — and recreate — ancient wines drunk by the likes of King David and Jesus Christ. - &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/30/world/middleeast/with-indigenous-grapes-israel-breaks-new-ground-in-wine-industry.html?_r=0" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Israel Aims to Recreate Wine That Jesus and King David Drank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					  &lt;p&gt;how can I choose between two bottles in a non-arbitrary, and objective way?&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can't. It's purely a subjective exercise. It is a dark art that takes a lot of tasting and learning what regions you like and winemakers you like. Even high points from a well known critic aren't a sure bet. If I were you, I would start reading Wine Spectator and Wine Advocate and whatever online wine resources you can find to get an education about what you like. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Things are easier in Europe where they more tightly control the wine making/grape growing process and some regions like Bordeaux, Champagne and Burgundy you can assume a certain high quality from a certain appellation. In the "New" world (USA, Australia, South Africa, etc) it's more of a crap shoot. Napa Valley wine is not a sure bet. It involves a lot of research and personal preference. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;People spend many years and tons of money trying to figure this out and it's a never ending process. The journey is long and paved with many bad bottles. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a safe bet, dry still red wines should be served between 18-20°C
					Of course exceptions apply... &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Opening time prior to service depends on the vintage, older wines (4+ years) need to breathe longer than young wines (0-3 years).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Knowing what kind of wine you have would help, denomination and vintage being the most useful information.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I know wineries that spent huge amounts on a label design and others that keep it super simple with just text and no graphics. The sky is the limit on designing a label. I had to spend about $1000 USD to have a decent label designed. Then printing it on really high quality paper cost $$$$. I was charging between $30-$50 a bottle for my wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I was spending around $0.25 a label, $.40 a cork, $.50 tin capsule and about $0.75 a glass bottle. I can only imagine that production costs on the Canary islands are probably double that because it costs so much to ship that stuff to the islands. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Packaging costs become less of a factor the more expensive your wine is. For me it was about $3 per bottle. If you wine costs $10 then it's a huge percentage. If you are charging $50, then it becomes less of an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wine labels are like snowflakes, not two are alike and why someone would choose eye popping graphics for a low production wine from the Canary Islands, I have no idea. Those usually are reserved for supermarket level wines so you are compelled to pick it up off the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If fact, If you look at the most expensive wines in the world. They have very conservative labels. &lt;a href="https://financesonline.com/top-10-most-expensive-red-wines-in-the-world-cabernet-sauvignon-tops-the-list/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;10 most expensive labels&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;An excellent practice is also read the wine back label. In some cases there is information about the "serving temprature" and also this maybe can be found on the winnery webpage. Some wineries web site are in their local language as well as English.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Is there such a thing as dedicated sacramental wine?  After a bit of research, my own conclusions are that it is simply wine.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://forums.catholic.com/showthread.php?t=329152" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Catholic Forum&lt;/a&gt; also had this to say. Thus I believe that it is difficult to answer as possibly the wine could be simply purchased.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;A lot of people don't realize this, but there's nothing particular
					  that makes altar wine "altar wine". The wine for the Precious Blood
					  must be true wine, made from grapes, and have no additional sweeteners
					  or flavorings, or preservatives (beyond a bare minimum), or anything
					  else. The vast majority of wines available on the shelf might
					  potentially be used as altar wine. The only difference is that a
					  competent authority in the Church has certified this wine for use at
					  the altar.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;That's a long way of sayiing that vintners produce a line of wine and
					  most of the bottles get "regular" labels, and some of them get "altar
					  wine" labels, but the product inside is identical. It might already be
					  on the shelf at your local store, but it's just not labeled the same.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;So you could contact the winery, ask who their distributors are, and
					  buy all you want. A very few wineries cater exclusively to Catholic
					  churches, so you might have some difficulty getting them to sell it to
					  you--not because they can't but simply because they don't have any
					  method of selling to a private person.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Land Down Under&lt;/em&gt;, the  &lt;strong&gt;Sevenhill Cellars&lt;/strong&gt; is the only winery in Australia specializing in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramental_wine" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;sacramental wine&lt;/a&gt;, and the only one recommended by the Catholic Church to be used in Mass.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Easter is a busy time of year for the oldest operational winery in South Australia’s Clare Valley, Sevenhill Cellars. As Maria Tickle writes, the winery supplies the bulk of the sacramental wine for Australasia, pumping out &lt;strong&gt;90,000 litres a year.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The winery’s story began in 1851 when a group of Jesuit priests bought 100 acres in the heart of the Clare Valley and named it Sevenhill, hoping to create a Catholic cultural centre akin to the Sevenhill district of Rome. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The Jesuits started a winery that began supplying sacramental wine to the surrounding parishes in 1858.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Brother John says his sacramental wine stacks up rather well even on the international market. 'I’ve even actually tasted the altar wine which they sell in Cana of Galilee, where the Lord changed the water into wine, and I’ve tried that wine, I prefer ours,' he says. - &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/rnfirstbite/clare-valley-winery-sevenhill-cellars-produces-a-heavenly-drop/5381562" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Clare Valley winery Sevenhill Cellars produces a heavenly drop.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;All three types of their Altar Wines are made in accordance with Canon Law.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Sevenhill's sacramental wine is made in three styles in a similar fortified method to Apera (the official name for sherry in Australia). Sweet Red is a blend of Grenache, Ruby Cabernet and Pedro Ximenez grapes. Sevenhill's sacramental wine is made as naturally as possibly with minimal winemaking intervention in conformity with the requirements of Canon Law. - &lt;a href="https://www.sevenhill.com.au/wine-portfolio/sweet-red" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wine Portfolio: Sacramental / Altar Wines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Let's start with what are Nomex corks and what are natural corks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomex" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Nomex&lt;/a&gt; is a registered trademark for flame-resistant meta-aramid material developed in the early 1960s by DuPont and first marketed in 1967.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Nomex and related aramid polymers are related to nylon, but have aromatic backbones, and hence are more rigid and more durable. Nomex is the premier example of a meta variant of the aramids (Kevlar is a para aramid). Unlike Kevlar, Nomex cannot align during filament formation and has poorer strength. However, it has excellent thermal, chemical, and radiation resistance for a polymer material.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"Nomex corks" for wine do not exist. In fact "Nomex cork" material is used as a &lt;a href="http://www.auburn-mfg.com/gasket-material-guide.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;gasket material&lt;/a&gt; for engines and the like. &lt;strong&gt;I believe you are thinking of rubber corks.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Natural cork comes from the outer bark of the cork tree.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Cork is produced from the sponge like material taken from cork oak trees, also known as Quercus Suber. Cork oak trees are grown primarily in Portugal. Cork started to become the sealing material of choice in the late 1600’s when it became possible to create glass wine bottles with an almost uniform shape and design. It took until the late 1700’s to create easy to use corkscrews for the wine lover or tavern owner. At that point in history, cork replaced glass wine stoppers, which while they worked well, glass stoppers were not easy to remove without breaking the wine bottle. The pairing of the cork and wine bottle ushered fine wine into the modern age, as from that point forward, wine had the ability to age and evolve in the bottle. Interestingly cork and fine wine share another commonality. The cork, oak tree needs to be at least 25 years old before the material used to create the cork can be harvested. This is similar to the age of vines in many of the world’s best wine regions. While grape vines are harvested every year, cork trees are only able to be harvested once every nine years. - &lt;a href="http://www.thewinecellarinsider.com/wine-topics/wine-education-articles/wine-corks-everything-need-know-wine-corks/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wine Corks Everything You Need to Know About Wine Corks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternative wine closures or corks&lt;/strong&gt; can be seen here and many are known as rubber corks and plastic corks: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Alternative wine closures are substitute closures used in the wine industry for sealing wine bottles in place of traditional cork closures. The emergence of these alternatives has grown in response to quality control efforts by winemakers to protect against "cork taint" caused by the presence of the chemical trichloroanisole (TCA). - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_wine_closure" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Alternative wine closures (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are pros and cons to using of all types of corks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The problems with synthetic corks is the lack of a perfect seal. In turn that allows more unwanted air into the bottle, causing the wine to oxidize. Worse, many of the synthetic corks have been known to impart a slight rubber or chemical smell, damaging the wine. Beherns and Hitchcock, a producer of Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa California was one of the early proponents of plastic corks. Most of the wines bottled using those synthetic corks have not developed well. Many of those wines are defective. However, today, they have improved since their initial creation. Because the plastic corks allow air to integrate at a faster pace than normal corks, some winemakers actually prefer it. In fact, that has become part of the selling point as the corks can be ordered to allow for a more or less rapid transmission of air into the wine, based on the tightness of seal.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Wine corks do however have problems, the major issue being infection with TCA, which causes what is known by wine collectors and others in the wine business as Corked Wine. Corked bottles of wine remains a serious problem in the wine industry as many people think that it effects between 5% to 10% of all wine undrinkable.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The old saying that nothing lasts forever is especially true with wine. When a wine cork degrades, so does the wine, due to additional exposure to air, which in turn causes premature oxidization. Before that happens, for rare and expensive bottles, it might be possible to replace your old cork with a new wine cork. This is something you cannot do at home on your own. For more on replacing your wine cork, &lt;a href="http://www.thewinecellarinsider.com/wine-topics/wine-educational-questions/recorked-or-reconditioned-bottles-explained" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Everything you need to know about Re-Corking wine bottles.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Corks have been the undisputed choice to seal wine bottles for hundreds of years. But with all the alternative enclosures available these days, &lt;em&gt;by 2016, it is estimated that only 70% of all wine bottles today are sealed with natural corks.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Still, at the end of day, it is unlikely corks will be replaced as the sealer of choice for the best wines.&lt;/strong&gt; In part, there is the romance and tradition of removing the cork, coupled with that special popping sound that lets you know, you are about to drink a wine and that is something technology cannot improve on. - &lt;a href="http://www.thewinecellarinsider.com/wine-topics/wine-education-articles/wine-corks-everything-need-know-wine-corks/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wine Corks Everything You Need to Know About Wine Corks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Although natural cork is more eco-friendly, they are s slightly more expensive than their counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes and No. Expensive wines are &lt;em&gt;generally&lt;/em&gt; bottled in more expensive packaging because there is a greater profit margin and winemakers want to exude an air of exclusivity and expense. The unfortunately part is usually you can't see the cork because of the foil and the dark color of the bottle. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But, if you could visually inspect the cork before you open the bottle, yes those that tend to use more expensive corks generally mean a higher quality wine. Screwcaps and plastic corks generally mean a lower quality wine, EXCEPT in Australia and New Zealand where there is a large push to use screwcaps for all levels of wine to reduce TCA taint. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, if you could look at the cork, these are the things you might look for. &lt;/p&gt;

					8 oz. of strawberries cut into slices&lt;br&gt;
					3 peaches cut into slices&lt;br&gt;
					1 lemon cut into slices&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Combine all the ingredients together in one pitcher. Pour over ice.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And, just in case you want a full-on killer cocktail: &lt;a href="http://portcocktails.com/cocktails.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Maria McClaire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;1 1/2 oz. Irish whiskey&lt;br&gt;
					1 oz. Fonseca Siroco White Port&lt;br&gt;
					1/2 oz. Campari&lt;br&gt;
					2 dashes Peychaud's Bitters&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Strain into a chilled cocktail glass and twist a thin-cut swatch of orange peel over the top.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While this is just a theory (I'm ignorant to the taste of fig wine! :( - it would seem that any food that pairs well with figs would do the trick. Such as Goat Cheese or Prosciutto...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The marketing strategy of labeling wines below the luxury or super-premium price points with grape varietal names was just emerging in the late 60s or early 70s. So the product name may not have been a varietal; as a "jug wine" it may have been a marketing name for a blend (perhaps Zinfandel &amp;amp; Barbera).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Alternatively Hugh Johnson's Vintage: &lt;em&gt;The Story of Wine&lt;/em&gt; states that a vine called '&lt;strong&gt;Black Zinfardel&lt;/strong&gt; from Hungary' was offered in the 1830 catalog of the Princes of Long Island nursery (p 364). Could it be a memory lapse?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I don't know the taste of fig wine, but I do love figs, both fresh and dried, so I'm thinking it's along the lines of fruit cake (not a fave), minus the rum or brandy, but with it's own alcoholic pleasure (very much a fave). Some suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charcuterie&lt;/strong&gt;: bacon, ham, sausage, terrines, galantines, ballotines, pâtés, confit&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheeses&lt;/strong&gt;: goat, blue, Gorgonzola, camembert, Stilton, brie, mascarpone&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grilled&lt;/strong&gt;: veg (corn on the cob, tomatoes), chicken (spicy or citrus), fish (tuna, swordfish)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And, from my &lt;a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;New York Times Recipe Box&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If I am completely off the track here, tell me and I will delete my answer - but I will have a bash at this.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I found some information &lt;a href="http://www.decanter.com/tag/wine-films/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;, at decanter.com.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wine films&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;There are several well-known films based on the drinking or making of
					  wine or the wine industry itself. They range from American
					  comedy-drama Bottle Shock (featuring Alan Rickman as wine expert
					  Steven Spurrier), buddy-movie Sideways and book adaptation A Good Year
					  to smaller pictures such as the controversial Mondovino, mockumentary
					  Corked and French hit Vagabond.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Individual wines have also featured on the big screen including
					  Chateau Margaux in Withnail &amp;amp; I and Sherlock Holmes, Chateau Latour in
					  Monty Python’s Meaning of Life, Chateau Angelus in James Bond Casino
					  Royale and Veuve Clicquot in Casablanca.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;In May 2012 it was announced The Billionaire’s Vinegar is to be turned
					  into a motion picture starring Brad Pitt.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, when I owned my winery (after 15 years I had to shut it down) I went through distributors and agents. Distributors typically buy the wine from me at a 50% discount from the retail price and then mark it up to the 30% discount mark and sell it to retail/restaurant at that price, where the retailer marks it up to to whatever they want. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, let say I have a $10 bottle of wine. I sell it to a distributor for $5. They mark it up to $7 and sell it to retail. Retailers usually will sell it for around 100% of the price you suggest. Restaurants sell at usually 200% of retail.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, on a $10 bottle of wine the distributor is making $3 a bottle. That's what we have to work with. Of that $3 there are overhead costs, profits and % goes to the salesman. I once worked with a commission only wine sales guy and he was making 10% on a case of wine. So in our theoretical exercise he makes $1 a bottle or $12 a case. I think 10-12% is typical for commission only sales. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Being a wine salesman is a tough business and it takes a lot of relationship building and cold calls and super thin margins. Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Madeira is a fortified wine and very very sturdy. Pretty hard to ruin it.  I would not decant it but let it settle to the proper temperature. If you have it too cold you miss some of the flavor and too warm the alcohol is too prominent. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.vinhomadeira.pt/Temperature-208.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://www.vinhomadeira.pt/Temperature-208.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is usually recommended that the wine be served at between 13 and 14º for younger wines while older wines, given their greater complexity, should be served at a temperature varying between 15ºC and 16ºC.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most fortified wines such as port, Madeira, (sweet) sherry, Commandaria are both very sweet and are very high in alcohol. Many are in the range of 20% ABV. I would strongly [pun intended] suggest seeing if she enjoys Port or Madeira. My personal favourite strong, sweet wine is &lt;a href="https://www.majestic.co.uk/Elysium-Black-Muscat-zid18224" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Elysium Black muscat&lt;/a&gt;. It is so sweet that I commonly have it as dessert in restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It depends on how sweet you are looking for. If you are looking for very sweet than dessert wines are the way to go, a &lt;strong&gt;Sauternes&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Mustacel&lt;/strong&gt; will be at least 12% if not higher. If all you want is a fruitier wine then many German white wines like &lt;strong&gt;Rieslings&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Gewürztraminers&lt;/strong&gt; tend to be on the sweet side, sometimes too sweet for many palates. Slightly less sweet whites are &lt;strong&gt;Sauvignon Blancs, Chenin blancs&lt;/strong&gt;, soaves, the list goes on. All of these should be above 12%&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Reds are tough for people with sweet palates, there are red dessert wines out there, and there are sweeter reds but there's no variety I can think of that is reliably sweeter. Roses are often sweet, especially the cheaper ones like &lt;strong&gt;White Zinfandel&lt;/strong&gt;, but those can be low quality. A good &lt;strong&gt;Zinfandel&lt;/strong&gt; red is a great wine, but not what I'd consider sweet. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A little primer on alcohol and sugar in wine. The lower the alcohol is usually associated with higher acid levels because the grapes are picked less ripe. Champagne is a good example of this. To offset the biting acids, winemakers usually add sugar to compensate. That's why so many low alcohol wines are sweet. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Can you find higher alcohol wines that are sweeter? Sure, dessert wines come to mind. Sauternes, Ice Wines, Tokay, Late Harvest wines are sweet with more alcohol. A lot of mainstream wine brands, like Sutter Home are purposely made sweeter. Unfortunately, the cheaper the wine, usually the sweeter it is. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Like I always mention here, wine is an adventure that only you can travel. You need to discover what you like (or your wife in this case). But I think these are several recommendations that should set you on the path.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Please consider the sweet and fortified wines of the Rhone with &lt;em&gt;Muscat de Beaumes de Venise&lt;/em&gt; being the kind of wine that might give satisfaction allround. I find that the great house of E. Guigal offers an excellent price/quality/ratio for this wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My favourite wine varietal these days is Portguese Vinho Verde which is a super-sweet white wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Two major brands are Sogrape Gazela Vinho Verde at 9% ABV, sugar content 11g/L or Caves Alianca Vinicola De Sangalhos Vinho Verde which is actually 10% ABV, sugar content 14g/L&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wine and movie pairing, although not a very popular item these days, some people seem to be into it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples, for what they are worth.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silence of the Lambs&lt;/strong&gt; (1991) can be paired with &lt;strong&gt;Chianti&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Suit Yourself Pinot Grigio&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Alamo Drafthouse is releasing two wines that pay tribute to the classic killer chiller: Cannibal Chianti and Suit Yourself Pinot Grigio.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Italian-grown Cannibal Chianti is a 85% Sangiovese blend with Canaiolo and Malvasia del Chianti, a DOCG wine from a vineyard between Florence and Sienna. Alamo notes that it has “savory plum and tobacco leaf notes.” Suit Yourself Pinot Grigio — a reference to “Lambs” killer Buffalo Bill’s penchant for wearing suits made of women’s skin — is a California wine from the Central Coast and inland vineyards with notes of “tropical peach and Mexican limes with just a hint of honey.” - &lt;a href="http://variety.com/2013/film/news/silence-of-the-lambs-wines-from-alamo-drafthouse-quaff-some-cannibal-chianti-1200489046/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Silence of the Lambs’ Wines From Alamo Drafthouse: Quaff Some Cannibal Chianti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One must admit that Hannibal Lecter is one sick dude.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;What most people seem to remember about Silence of the Lambs is not when Hannibal Lecter triumphs while shooting two FBI agents, but when Lecter tries to scare off FBI trainee Foster. Lecter says, "A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice &lt;strong&gt;Chianti&lt;/strong&gt;." - &lt;a href="https://www.vivino.com/wine-news/article-wines-made-famous-by-the-movies" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wines Made Famous by the Movies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/strong&gt; (1931) or any Frankenstein movie may be paired with Francis Coppola Director’s &lt;strong&gt;Frankenstein Cabernet Sauvignon&lt;/strong&gt; 2014 California.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"The Monster" is Boris Karloff's signature film role, and much like a finely crafted bottle of wine, his performance is the result of dedication, study and collaboration with other expert filmmakers.Prepare to be stirred by Dr. Frankenstein's creation and this thrilling Cabernet Sauvignon. - &lt;a href="http://tcmwineclub.com/francis-coppola-directors%20frankenstein-cabernet-sauvignon-2014/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Movie &amp;amp; Wine Pairing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are a &lt;strong&gt;Cleopatra&lt;/strong&gt; fan you may try a blend of Zinfandel and Pinot Noir called &lt;strong&gt;Cleopatra&lt;/strong&gt; 2014 California.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Inspired by the legendary allure of the Queen of the Nile, Cleopatra’s namesake red showcases the bounty of California’s stellar 2014 vintage. It’s a bramble- and spice-packed blend of Zinfandel and Pinot Noir, masterfully blended with California rarities like Mourvèdre, Alicante Bouschet and Barbera and more. Winemaker Rob McNeill, of Sonoma’s famed Don Sebastiani &amp;amp; Sons, gave this tempting potion further intrigue with a little oak aging. As you’ll discover, there’s (still) no resisting Cleopatra. - &lt;a href="https://www.vivino.com/wine-news/article-wines-made-famous-by-the-movies" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Movie &amp;amp; Wine Pairing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Of coarse &lt;strong&gt;James Bond&lt;/strong&gt; is quite unique in his wine pairs of his 22 episodes, so I will give only three examples here:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;“On Her Majesty’s Secret Service”: This is the first of two 007 movies in which the spy truly falls in love, so let’s go with something romantic, pink bubbles: the very-berry-ish, refined Schramsberg Brut Rosé.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;“Diamonds Are Forever”: My favorite Bond wine moment ever is when he uses two assassins’ ignorance about Bordeaux to out and wipe out the dastardly duo. So the tippling tout is the earthy but elegant Chateau D’Argadens Bordeaux Superiore.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Goldfinger”: For me (and countless others), this is the perfect Bond film: nonpareil villain, thug and “Bond girls.” So we need a near-perfect wine; let’s splurge and go with the always-stellar Chateau de Beaucastel Châteauneuf-du-Pape. - &lt;a href="http://What%20wine%20goes%20with%20each%20James%20Bond%20movie?" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;What wine goes with each James Bond movie?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My two cents:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Orange wine + sheeps cheese. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The cheese is rich, gooey, it'll support the sweetness of orange wine. I think it's better with a mature sheeps cheese like an aged Pecorino/Manchego.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Orange wine + apple pie/apfel gratin/apfelstrudel. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hahaha, inspired by my half-German half-Indonesian father. Being a seasonal vegetarian is kinda cool. You'll be the coolest vegetarian on earth.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Orange wine + Indonesian Kambing Guling (slow roasted young lamb shanks with Indonesian spices, herbs). &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Trust me the delicate meat of young lamb was born just to accompany orange wine. The spices, the herbs, the fat, will balance the structure of the wine. Here are some resources about Indonesian Bumbu/seasoning:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumbu_(seasoning)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumbu_(seasoning)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Orange wine + seafood + lemon + sliced/chopped raw onion. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Helping your seafood addiction whilst battling cholesterol (thank me later). The sour lemon will soften the wine somewhat. What about the taste? So precious that its value can't be determined.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First of all what can we say about &lt;strong&gt;orange wines&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Not only is their orange hue fitting for the season, but they tend to be heavier than whites and lighter than reds - a perfect compromise for the fall. Make sure to serve it slightly chilled, at around 55 degrees Fahrenheit, and try pairing it with those increasingly heavier fall meals, like roasted vegetables and poultry.  - &lt;a href="http://blog.cookingchanneltv.com/2010/10/19/orange-wine-in-time-for-halloween/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Crushing: Orange Wines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is what Jared Brandt says about orange wines:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"Orange wines fill in the gaps when pairing, because you get the acidity of a white and the tannins of a red," says Jared Brandt of Donkey &amp;amp; Goat winery in Berkeley, California. Last fall, he and his wife, Tracey, released a cloudy orange wine: a floral, spicy Roussanne. "We recently had a tofu dish that a red wine would have obliterated, and a &lt;strong&gt;rich lamb dish&lt;/strong&gt; that would have overwhelmed a white," Brandt says. He opted to pair both with an orange wine from Friuli's Stanko Radikon, one of Gravner's acolytes, and it worked brilliantly.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Some people might argue that rosé can be just as versatile with food as an orange wine. Pax Mahle, who makes an orange Pinot Gris under his Wind Gap Wines label, replies that orange wines are funkier tasting (and thus more interesting) than rosés. "Rather than something that goes with your picnic, orange wines go with your &lt;strong&gt;truffle pasta&lt;/strong&gt;," he says. Essentially, the wines have umami. - &lt;a href="http://www.foodandwine.com/articles/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Ancient  Wine Techniques, Simple Dishes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Matthew Latkiewicz has these foods to pair with orange wine:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;But here’s what to do: Drink some orange wine along with food. Orange wines are all over the place from a flavor standpoint, so there’s no go-to rule for pairing it, but unlike a lot of white wines, which get bowled over by strong food flavors, orange wine has the structure and acidity from the skins to stand up to strong dishes while still retaining the spectrum of white-wine flavors. Without getting too wonky about the pairing-speak, know that you can also ditch fish-with-white, meat-with-red thinking; orange wine is a lot more versatile. For example, a bottle of Angiolino Maule Sassaia, which tastes almost nutty, can holds its own against something like &lt;strong&gt;grilled hanger steak&lt;/strong&gt;; and that Vinujancu had a lot of qualities of a funky craft beer; it’d be great at cutting through fatty dishes — or &lt;strong&gt;anything with bacon&lt;/strong&gt;. - &lt;a href="http://www.grubstreet.com/2012/08/what-is-orange-wine-sloshed.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Sloshed: How to Enjoy Orange Wine, the Indie Darling of the Wine World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is yet another blog has to say that might be of interest to some:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Orange wine is a bit of a misnomer because it isn’t referring to a wine made with oranges nor is it a Mimosa cocktail (a blend of 1 part orange juice to 2 parts sparkling wine.) Orange wine is something entirely different.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Because of their boldness, orange wines pair excellently with bolder foods including &lt;strong&gt;curry dishes, Moroccan cuisine, Ethiopian cuisine&lt;/strong&gt; (like those &lt;strong&gt;spongelike pancakes called Injera&lt;/strong&gt;), &lt;strong&gt;Korean dishes with fermented kimchi such as bibim bap&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;traditional Japanese cuisine&lt;/strong&gt; including fermented soybeans (Natto). Due to high phenolic content (tannin and bitterness) along with the nutty tartness, orange wines &lt;strong&gt;pair with a wide variety of meats from beef to fish.&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href="http://winefolly.com/review/orange-wine/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;All About Orange Wine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Late Harvest&lt;/strong&gt; these are grapes that are left on the vine until they reach a certain brix (sugar %) level outside the normal range for regular table wine. There are several sub categories of Late Harvest, which include Ice Wine, Botrytized, sun dried (raisined) and regular late harvest.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One of the better known of the late harvest wines is Sauternes. These are wines picked after the grapes have gotten moldy. (AKA Noble Rot) The mold acts to dry out the grapes making them like raisins. These wines are from white grapes mainly. In Hungary they are from Tokay. In the Alsace they are called Sélection de Grains Nobles (selection of the noble berries). The mold concentrates the sugars and adds it's own special flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ice Wine&lt;/strong&gt; In certain places in the world, like Canada, USA and Germany the grapes need to be naturally frozen &lt;em&gt;on the vine&lt;/em&gt; to be called &lt;strong&gt;Ice Wine&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;this is the law&lt;/em&gt;. The temperature varies but somewhere around -7f to -10f before they are allowed to be picked. It's a crap shoot since you are not assured you will get that cold in the winter following harvest. So it is rare. They need to use special hydraulic presses since you are pressing the sugar out of little round ice balls. Sugar levels are so high that the yeast cannot complete fermentation leaving residual sweetness after fermentation. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iced Wine&lt;/strong&gt; In many parts of the world there is no regulation around the word "ice wine" and many wine makers just take grapes and throw them in a huge freezer and mechanically freeze them called &lt;strong&gt;cryoextraction&lt;/strong&gt;. Since they can't legally use the term "Ice Wine" without freezing them on the vine, they had to come up with a made up name. Iced Wine is one of those names. &lt;a href="https://www.vivino.com/wineries/frost-bitten/wines/yakima-valley-ice-riesling-9999" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Frostbitten&lt;/a&gt; Ice Wine is a proprietary name from winemaker here in Washington State &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think you are mixing up &lt;a href="http://idinealone.blogspot.com/2008/11/soupe-au-vin-from-anthony-bourdains-les.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Soupe au Vin&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soupe_au_vin_sucr%C3%A9" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Soupe au vin sucré&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It looks like it can be either red or white wine, but mostly it's made with red wine. I would look for a fruity, light bodied red wine to complement the fruit and sugar. A Burgundy or Beaujolais but not too expensive. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Basically the &lt;strong&gt;Strawberry Wine Soup&lt;/strong&gt; is an &lt;em&gt;uncooked&lt;/em&gt; soup and as such a wine that is paired with strawberries should fit the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;So consider something from a cool-climate region, because cooler spots produce grapes with high acid: Germany's subtle, beautifully balanced dessert rieslings; a demi-sec (medium) champagne; or frothy, honeyed Italian moscati d'asti. Choose a premium Bordeaux pudding wine such as sauternes if you really want to splash out. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Or go for a sweet muscat instead. Muscat produces amazingly versatile dessert wines, juicy and fresh-tasting, even when they come from a warmer region and are strong and weighty in texture. Think apricots, oranges, a drop of caramel. And think affordable. Muscats from southern France and moscatels from Valencia in Spain are extraordinarily well priced. - &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/wine/9290608/Wine-Review-Wine-to-serve-with-strawberries.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wine Review: Wine to serve with strawberries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;More wine pairing with strawberries can be seen &lt;a href="http://www.winedin.com/strawberries+Wine+Pairing" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This site &lt;a href="http://www.ebay.com/gds/Top-13-Fruits-to-Pair-with-Wine-/10000000177742210/g.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;(Top 13 Fruits to Pair with Wine)&lt;/a&gt; pairs strawberries as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strawberry Pairing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White Wines&lt;/strong&gt;: Champagne, Prosecco, White Zinfandel, Chardonnay&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red Wines&lt;/strong&gt;: Pinot Noir, Zinfandel&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But then again one could simply go with &lt;a href="https://www.stjameswinery.com/strawberry-wine/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;strawberry wine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XpwX3.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XpwX3.jpg" alt="Soupe de fruits au vin rouge"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As seen in the above image the French use all sorts of fruit in their &lt;em&gt;Soupe au Vin.&lt;/em&gt; This soup is simply not done with strawberries or toasted bread cubes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Winemakers can make either a dry wine or sweet wine. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the winemakers want to make a sweet wine, they must artificially halt the fermentation process by either increasing or decreasing the temperature in the fermentation tank to a certain level in which the yeasts cannot survive. Manipulating the temperature kills the yeast (well, actually they lay dormant) and it allows natural sugar to be left in the wine. The high sugar concentration of the grape plays a role, too. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is a second way to artificially halt the fermentation process, it is called fortification. Winemakers will add alcohol during the fermentation process to a level in which the yeasts cannot survive, also leaving natural sugar in the wine. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And by the way, Moscato is purposefully made in a sweet style which is why it is always sweet. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Moscato is a sparkling white wine made in the Piedmont region of Italy. It is made with Muscat (Moscato) grapes. They are fermented naturally until they hit 5.5% ABV and then the wine is run through a sterile filter to preserve the sweetness and stop fermentation. It's then artificially carbonated and put in a bottle. It's meant to be an dessert wine because of this sweetness. Also known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscato_d%27Asti" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Moscato d'Asti&lt;/a&gt; and there is a similar wine made nearby simply called Asti. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It can be red, white, or even sparkling wine (such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkling_wine#Cr.C3.A9mant" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;'Crémant'&lt;/a&gt;, less expensive than Champagne, white or rosé). The choice will affect the taste of the soup, so it's better to know whether the persons you intend to serve the soup to will like this kind of wine. There's no &lt;strong&gt;known to be the best&lt;/strong&gt; wine, there's the one your guests/you like :)
					You can then make the soup accordingly, and adapt the type of wine/strawberry/ingredients you use (lemon ? mint ? cinnamon ?...)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bitter the strawberries, the sweeter the wine&lt;/em&gt; is a kind of good rule AFAIK.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If not using wine, I've had a really good experience with a blackcurrent cream (6/8°). It came from Burgundy/France. It gives a more sweet, and a little more thicker soup. It can be use alone, or mixed (40% to 60 % or +/-) with red wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Pinot noir is my favourite, but @Ken already gave you some good tips about wines (Muscat, Chardonnay, Pinot, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asti_wine" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Asti&lt;/a&gt;, Gamay...) so I'll focus about the &lt;em&gt;if my recipe could be improved somehow&lt;/em&gt; part of your question.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I made soups with a couple of &lt;em&gt;freshly cut mint leaves&lt;/em&gt; in it (feels really refreshing then). You can also add &lt;em&gt;cinnamon&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;vanilla&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;ginger&lt;/em&gt; in the wine when you heat it (but I recommand not to use any two of them at the same time and mixing).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A tiny lemon juice (some drops) over the strawberries also adds some refreshing taste.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Instead of the toasted bread, little cubes of cinnamon bread is good too (but then, no cinammon  in the wine when heating, otherwise, it's too much of it).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;No strawberries ? any fruit like raspberries, peaches or cherries can do it too...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;No, this would destroy the wine/mash/beer that your were trying to remove the "head" from. Just to make the &lt;a href="https://www.clawhammersupply.com/blogs/moonshine-still-blog/12243869-making-moonshine-still-temperature" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;first pass&lt;/a&gt; in a still to remove this head, you would need to get the liquid up to around 200f to start the process, thereby destroying whatever your were trying to get the less desirable aspects out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Malbec is a French wine and at one point was grown in 30 different departments of France, a legacy that is still present in the abundance of local synonyms for the variety. However this variety of grapes is in decline in part due to its' sensitivities to so many different vine ailments (coulure, downy mildew, frost). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;In recent times, the popularity of the variety has been steadily declining with a 2000 census reporting only 15,000 acres (6,100 hectares) of the vine mostly consigned to the southwestern part of the country. Its stronghold remains Cahors where Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) regulations stipulates that Malbec must compose at least 70% of the blend, with Merlot and Tannat rounding out the remaining percentage. Outside of Cahors, Malbec is still found in small amounts as a permitted variety in the AOCs of Bergerac, Buzet, Côtes de Duras, Côtes du Marmandais, Fronton and Pécharmant. It is also permitted in the Vin Délimité de Qualité Supérieure (VDQS) of Côtes du Brulhois. In the MIDI region of the Languedoc, it is permitted (but rarely grown) in the AOC regions of Cabardès and Côtes de Malepère. There is a small amount of Malbec grown in the middle Loire Valley and permitted in the AOCs of Anjou, Coteaux du Loir, Touraine and the sparkling wine AOC of Saumur where it is blended with Cabernet Sauvignon and Gamay. But as elsewhere in France, Malbec is losing acreage other varieties—most notably Cabernet Franc in the Loire.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The grape was historically a major planting in Bordeaux, providing color and fruit to the blend, but in the 20th century started to lose ground to Merlot and Cabernet Franc due, in part, &lt;strong&gt;to its sensitivities to so many different vine ailments (coulure, downy mildew, frost).&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The severe 1956 frost wiped out a significant portion of Malbec vines in Bordeaux, allowing many growers a chance to start anew with different varieties.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; By 1968 plantings in the Libournais was down to 12,100 acres (4,900 hectares) and fell further to 3,460 acres (1,400 hectares) by 2000. While Malbec has since become a popular component of New World meritages or Bordeaux blends, and it is still a permitted variety in all major wine regions of Bordeaux, its presence in Bordeaux is as a distinctly minor variety. Only the regions of the Côtes-de-Bourg, Blaye and Entre-Deux-Mers have any significant plantings in Bordeaux. - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbec" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Malbec (Wikipedia).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your question is a little vague. I'm assuming by the nature of your question, you mean the health benefits as opposed to the environmental benefits. Having been growing organic wine grapes for 18 years I think I can address both issues. I might have a more controversial view than most people, but in the end I don't think it makes a lot of difference to drink Organic wine vs. traditional farming from a health perspective. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Grapes are grown, generally, in a dry and hot climate. California, Australia, Spain, Italy. Because of this, there are usually less problems with rot and mildew on grape vines. The two biggest problems are powdery mildew and botrytis. There are some insect problems, but generally they are not a big deal. Compared to other crops like lettuce, strawberries, potatoes, the amount of fertilizer and spraying is minimal. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, what I am trying to say is that amount of chemicals sprayed on grapevines is already at a low level compared to many other foods you might consume. Here is my controversial take on Organic vs. Traditional wine making. Growers will actually spray MORE chemicals on their grapes they are just "organic" just because the Organic chemicals are not as effective. That means more tractors, more people contributing to pollution in and around the vineyard. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;On top of that, in the USA, "&lt;a href="https://www.ttb.gov/pdf/wine-labeling-guide.pdf" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Organic Wine&lt;/a&gt;" is different than in Europe. In Europe, it means that grapes were grown organically. In the USA, it means that they were grown organically AND do not use sulfites. Which the Europeans have known to help preserve wine for thousands of years and are naturally occurring during the fermentation process. (BTW, sulfites are also a nasty chemical in large amounts). There are way more sulfites on your pre-packaged salad and raisins than there are in wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;REMEMBER, you are consuming a beverage that contains about 14% of a known carcinogen, namely Ethanol. So expecting your drink to have these huge health benefits is kind of a false flag.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You have to ask yourself why there isn't a lot more Organic wine on the market? A fellow grower told me that it doesn't make economical sense. It costs way more money to grow them vs. traditional or just grow Organic grapes and not have to do all the record keeping, which takes a lot of time and money. High quality growers, for the most part are a thoughtful bunch and really don't want to spray non-organic chemicals and winemakers use non-organic chemicals in the winery.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, here is my recommendation. I really don't think there is a huge environmental or health edge for Organic wine. High volume, low priced wines will generally have more chemicals in them. If you can find an Organic red wine that you like and you can afford, got for it. If you can spend a little more money, say $20 or more for a bottle of wine, those wines probably came from grapes that were babied way more than a box wine grapes and probably have less chemicals in them in general. In fact as you go up the price curve it's generally known they have less and less chemical inputs. So, the more you can spend, the less chemicals will probably be in your wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;(And to blow your mind, many wines are not vegetarian! And you have no way to find out.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The closest thing I can find (and am currently aware of) is &lt;a href="https://lcboapi.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;LCBO API&lt;/a&gt;.

					&lt;p&gt;I have pretty extensive experience blending wine in my winery over 15 years. There are two types of blends. Pre-fermentation and post-fermentation. The pre-fermentation is usually called a "field blend". This was the old style way of blending wines before we started doing it in the lab. Growers would plant a variety of vines, for example Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in Bordeaux, to hedge their bets on what kind of year it was going to be since they all ripen at different times. They do bring different flavor components to the blend. In Ye Olde days, they would just throw everything in the fermenter together relying on mother nature to give them a good blend.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Today, most blending is done post-fermentation. Very few people do field blends because they want the control over the blend. This is usually done in a laboratory setting. You would ideally want a few beakers with accurate measurements on it. Taste the two individual wines. Then I would start with a 50/50 blend and go from there. If you like more Riesling, then start blending a 60/40 blend of Riesling and Gewurz. Keep doing this until you end up with a blend you like. I usually will create a series of blends and keep them in separate glasses so I can go back and forth smelling and tasting them and keeping notes as I go.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You might dump some wine down the drain to get the blend you want, but once you figure it out, you can go straight to make that blend in the future. I would get an empty wine bottle and put your blend in there. You will have 2-3 days to drink it before it starts to go bad unless you make special effort to preserve it. In theory, you could by X number bottles of Riesling and Y bottles of Gewurz and make a blend of several bottles and rebottle it. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is a good &lt;a href="https://vinepair.com/wine-blog/how-to-make-your-own-bordeaux-style-red-wine-blend/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on how you can do it at home&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's difficult to answer why fermentation did not complete without further information.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's quite possible the sugar content was too high and pH to low for whatever yeast was added to survive and begin fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Vinegar however is created when bacteria that produce acetic acid are present in an environment with a sugar source and oxygen. They will thrive off of the sugar just like brewer's yeast, but will also produce acetic acid as a byproduct of their life processes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you wish to make cherry wine, I would suggest diluting the juice down to somewhere in the range of a sugar concentration of 10 percent, measuring with a hydrometer or refractometer, and using a yeast, possibly a dry wine yeast, that can withstand alcohol in ranges of 10-14 percent abv.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Simple answer is yes! The more complex answer is that it might not taste all that great but I've had some aged sparkling wines that were 10+ years old and were quite nice. But having lost it's carbonation does not make it bad, it will taste just like you described, cheap old wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Very few people stomp grapes anymore for commercial winemaking. There are some wineries that still do it, I've heard of several in burgundy. Maybe some really old world stuff in Eastern Europe. The problem is that is super messy. Grapes are very sweet and when that juice dries on you, it is very sticky. Machines are much more efficient at crushing and pressing these days and don't cost a whole lot and last a lifetime. I can't name anyone off the top of my head. A quick google search didn't turn up anything either. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for they hygienic part, grapes are full of bird poop, dead bugs, spider webs, dirt. I've found dead birds, bird nests, dead lizards, snakes, you name it in grapes and vineyards. So, dirty feet don't really have much on all this dirty natural stuff. It's all moot anyways because the alcohol level in wine is high enough to kill any pathogen that makes it way on the grapes. So, you are safe from that standpoint. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are several factors at play here. If we think about how grapes were maintained hundreds or thousands of years ago, it was kind of a slapdash affair. In the beginning they probably just grabbed whatever grapes they could off a vine growing up a tree. Later they just haphazardly planted grapes in a field hoping for the best and they mixed everything, Red and white grapes and IF they got a harvest they were grateful. This style of grape growing does not lend itself to high sugar grapes. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This illustration below shows some middle ages grape growing in Burgundy. It's basically a hillside planted every few inches. No trellis or anything. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bx1Qk.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bx1Qk.jpg" alt="Pruning Grapes Middle Ages France"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Several things changed that equation, especially after WW2. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;New World grape growing. Growing grapes in the new world exploded after WW2 and continues to expand rapidly to this day. Why is this a problem? It is and it isn't. You have to remember grapes like Pinot Noir, Riesling, Cabernet, Grenache were probably grapes that had been domesticated over hundreds or thousands of years to adapt to the climate the original vines were from. Cabernet is a good example. The dreary coast in Bordeaux where the weather is not especially warm. In a good year, the grapes might make a 13% ABV wine. You take Cabernet and stick it in Napa Valley where it is MUCH warmer and sunnier and voila, you have 17% ABV monster cabs. IMHO, it's mostly too hot in Napa Valley to make a balanced wine. Same with much of Australia and South America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern Viticultural practices. Also after WW2 irrigation was introduced this enabled growers to grow wine in areas that were too dry to grow grapes without it. Washington State is a good example. The Yakima valley gets around 9 inches of rain a year, but the temperatures are within a range of growing grapes, if a little too hot and sunny. Now you have a region that looks nothing like where the grapes originally came from. This also pertains to just about everything about growing grapes today. Trellis systems, fungicides, rootstocks, soil management, canopy management. Everything is done with a high precision to eke out the most of the vines, resulting in wines that are super ripe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern Tastes - As our palates seek out more and more sweet things, many of these modern wines are made with higher alcohols on purpose because many times high octane wines come with a fair amount of residual sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because we can! In the new world we don't have the baggage that they do in Europe. We are allowed to pretty much do anything to our wines as long as it's legal and food grade. So, if you grapes accidentally got a few extra days in 100+ degree weather and started to turn to raisins and they are at 29 brix. You paid good money for those grapes and you can't waste them so you dump some acidulated water into your fermenter to water them down to acceptable levels and replace some acid that was lost because your grapes are over ripe. All perfectly legal in the New World, but absolutely verbotten in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brand name grapes - Everyone wants Cabernet and Chardonnay. Sure you can grow them in the Central Valley in California where it is super hot in the summer, but what type of wine do you get? Hardly recognizable from the original areas they came from, but the consumers just want to have these brand name grapes so we plant them in places of abundant heat having to water them down in the fermenter to make acceptable wines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I remember my viticulture teacher telling me that you should plant grapes that would ripen almost at the last possible day of the season. This would result in grapes that are in harmony with the local climate. What you see in many places like California where grapes are harvested in July and August and there is still MONTHS of hot weather ahead. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;All of this leads to a situation where many of the grapes we plant in the new world are simply not in the best climate for the best wine. 99% of the time it's grapes planted in a climate that's simply too hot. That's why we water our wines down.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If Angove's are suggesting it may not be good, then its value as an investment is going to be low or zero, so if I were in your shoes I'd probably open it and try it. What's the worst that could happen?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, Vintage Ports are typically supposed to last a long time. As it mentions on the label, "extended bottle maturation" where the port is bottled with unfiltered sediment usually means they should be cellared for 20 or 30 years or even 40 years. So I'd suggest it will be coming into its own soon. Give it another few years and then open it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The person you talked to knows nothing about Port. Port is meant to age a very long time. Personally, I've had 50 year old ports that were excellent. Port is made by stopping fermentation with alcohol leaving behind some unfermented grape juice and about 20% alcohol. Because of the high alcohol, properly stored Port rarely has the problems that regular wine have. Actually, part of the reason they started putting alcohol in wine like this was exactly for abuse. It was meant to ship all over the world in adverse conditions and still be drinkable. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your Port now or hold for as long as can. Maybe up to another 20 years!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would open at the next possible occasion. Twenty three years is usually enough time for the majority of vintage ports to mature fully. When the previous commenter says he’s had wonderful 50 year old ports, he surely means ones from the very highest quality :
					 (1) Producers - I don’t know much about Angove’s but my quick research has revealed some older vintages of Angove’s  (early 70s) retailing for about $90. Top vintage ports from this era typically retail much higher. 
					 (2) Vintages - how was ‘95 for Australian port? I don’t know. 
					 (3) Provenance - you said yourself you’re not sure if it’s been stored properly. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Good luck! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are specific steps to restarting a stuck wine/mead/high gravity beer. You can read the whole procedure &lt;a href="http://blog.eckraus.com/making-a-wine-yeast-starter-to-restart-a-stuck-fermentation" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You'll need some champagne yeast or some other special yeast used to restart stuck fermentations. But it starts with this:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;For restarting 5 or 6 gallons, take a quart jar and fill it half way
					  with the wine in question. Add to that, water until the jar is 2/3
					  full. Put in the mix a 1/4 teaspoon of yeast nutrient, and 3
					  tablespoons of sugar. Be sure that the sugar becomes completely
					  dissolve. Now you can add a whole packet of the Champagne yeast. Cover
					  the jar with a paper towel and secure with a rubber band.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have lived in the Provence for a year and currently live on an Spanish island. In both of those locations wine making is one of the most prominent activities, plus those locations are old world and full of character but nowhere have I ever seen grapes being crushed my feet. Only in the movies. In fact in France and in Spain you find 100 year old bodegas where you can see the old wine presses on display.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Organic wine gives you no hangover! That much i can tell you from personal experience. I do live on an allover organic diet and love red wine, so naturally that is all i drink. I live in Europe and have visited quite a few organic wineries. The benefits become apparent when you talk to these people who tend to their vines personally day in and day out. The output of wine is not sure from year to year, since they can not rely on pesticides to guaranty output. The benefits are in the taste, environmental support, personal well being and knowledge that you drink something which was made with heart and soul.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is most likely tartrate crystals that have formed around the cork or a seam on the inside of the glass bottle. The like to attach to something rough. I have seen this many times. More often in white wine than red because of the higher tartaric acid levels, but it can occur in both. Generally when the wine has been stored in a cold location for an extended period of time. Like in a cellar or fridge. Nothing to worry about! Here is a picture of white wine crystals that have a similar shape.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Definitely, I wanted to expand on why you should try it.  Some quick points: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Vintage champagne, whilst not to everyone’s tastes, is usually only created when harvests are at their best.  Furthermore the grapes must be aged in a bottle for longer (a minimum of three times longer if memory serves) before release. This should be at least 18 months so the flavour develops.  Finally the taste develops in the bottle, just some reasons but it wasn’t designed to be drank in 1979.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As others have said a lot of people don’t often realise that vintage champagne is flat, the carbonation doesn’t last forever. The taste you are experiencing sounds right though and it is safe as long as it’s been sealed for it’s life etc.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hope that makes sense, hope it tastes nice!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You have a lot of information right out of Wikipedia when searching for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome_and_wine" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Ancient Rome + wine&lt;/a&gt;, and too much for it to be copied or gathered here. But here is some information I also learnt from History courses or readings.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Basically, many wines (Greece, France, Italy...) were kind of "sour" and people were used to adding spices (among other things), not only to "sweeten" the taste, but also to help store the wine and keep it drinkable for a longer time. &lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some of the wines the Romans used to drink (there may be more than that, of course):&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Mulsum -&gt; wine with spices and honey (served during the &lt;em&gt;gustatio&lt;/em&gt;, before the meal)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Turriculae -&gt; dry wine, with sea-water, fenugreek and &lt;em&gt;defrutum&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Carenum -&gt;  sweet and liquorous, from very mature / ripe grapes, with quince, various plants and &lt;em&gt;defrutum&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Vinum picatum -&gt; (&lt;em&gt;pitched wine&lt;/em&gt; is the closest I can come with in English) wine that was sweetened by the &lt;em&gt;pitch&lt;/em&gt; used to seal the container.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Why would they add many different plants / herbs / honey / water?&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ref. Wikipedia&lt;/strong&gt; : Romans drank their wine mixed with water, or in "mixed drinks" with flavorings. &lt;em&gt;Mulsum&lt;/em&gt; was a mulled sweet wine, and apsinthium was a wormwood-flavored forerunner of absinthe. Although wine was enjoyed regularly, and the Augustan poet Horace coined the expression "truth in wine" (in vino veritas), drunkenness was disparaged. It was a Roman stereotype that Gauls had an excessive love of wine, and drinking wine "straight" (&lt;em&gt;purum&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;merum&lt;/em&gt; = unmixed) was a mark of the "barbarian".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It seems that it was done for 3 purposes:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;keep wine longer and help it come from countries hundreds of miles and days of travel away.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;make the wine more "drinkable" and enjoyable.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;don't do like barbarians do and look like a well-educated person.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;-&gt; &lt;em&gt;How alcoholic was it?&lt;/em&gt; is a question I have no knowledge of and no answer to.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1 - FWIW: adding spices to a beverage was done again centuries later, when people started drinking hot chocolate (before the refining process / conche was discovered). The taste was so bitter / sour that people put a lot of spices and sugar in it.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2 - A reduction of must in Ancient Roman cuisine, made by boiling down grape juice or must in large kettles until reduced to half of the original volume. See also &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape_syrup" rel="noreferrer"&gt;grape syrup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Those sediments are frequent in wine (especially in aged red wine). They consist of tartar (we in Germany call it "Weinstein" which means "wine stone") and colours. Bottles that have been stored horizontally for a longer time frequently have that kind of sediments on the down side of the bottle. Red wine needs air after being opened and is therefore often filled into a decanter. When you do this carefully the sediments remain in the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In general the sediments are not hazardous to your health. The tartar can even be a symptom of good quality.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When you store wine you should lay bottles in horizontal and keep the label upside. After opening the bottle you should empty it carefully with label up. So everybody can read the label and the sediments will remain in the bottle to keep the wine in glasses clear.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, in the longer past not all bottles were really carefully cleaned. The result was a wine with a terrible taste, not even vinegar. You can be sure that since decades wine makers take care to have bottles clean, if they want to remain in business.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's pretty unlikely.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Given that it was a commercial wine I don't there was much live, viable yeast in the bottle. Particularly if sulfites were added, triggering additional fermentation would probably be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;On top of that, refrigerating it for the whole 24 hours means that, even if there was viable yeast uninhibited by sulfites, it's very unlikely it much fermentation could occur. It's possible you could see some fermentation due to the Crabtree effect but it wouldn't have been much.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Highly unlikely that the alcohol went up. Four reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The alcohol already in the wine is a barrier for the yeast to re-ferment.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The sulfites in the wine could inhibit refermentation if it hasn't dissipated yet. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The cold temperatures that will also inhibit fermentation. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Many commercial wines are sterile filtered so yeast counts are zero to very, very tiny. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, in 24 hours it's highly unlikely that it fermented again. Your perception of alcohol may be enhanced by the sugar that you added. High alcohol wines routinely taste "sweeter" to many people even though sugar levels are low. You might have tricked yourself into thinking sweet wine = higher alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The feeling of alcoholicity, at tasting, is very dependant of many factors, such as temperature of beverage, sugar, glycerol and a few other molecules content, and of course personal abilities of the taster as well as the  preceeding tastings. Concerning the present situtation, a simple experiment is a comparative tasting : keeping two glasses of the same wine, in closed glasses (sealed with plastic film to limit oxygenation/oxidation), put them aside the honeyed bottle in the fridge ; then a few minutes before tasting, get them all off the fridge, serve a glass from the bottle ("glass 1"), in "glass 2" (one from the fridge) add the same relative quantity of the same honey that was added in the bottle, and in the last fridge glass ("glass 3"), add the same relative quantity of white sugar. Again seal the three glasses in order to mix "2" and "3", and let them dissolve their addings (without forgetting to shake "glass 1" as much as the 2 others), and finally get all three be at the same temperature. Then taste, or better, have someone taste them without knowing which is what (blind tasting)… Not a complicated experiment, but sure the best way to know. My bet is "1" and "2" will be considered almost the same, and eventually a bit more alcoholic than "3".&lt;br/&gt;And my proposition for an explanation is that in honey, there are other molecular chemicals that enhance the feeling of alcohol (ethanol) (other "-ol"s and esters…?).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One wine comes to mind and that is the Apera wine produced in Australia. If you do a google search on apera and solera you will find numerous hits of wineries in Australia and Canada making something that is Sherry-like. Sherry is now a protected name place like Champagne, Chianti and Burgundy and can only be used in Spain of wines produced in the Jerez-Xeres-Sherry DO province of Cádiz in the region of Andalusia. Everything else produced in a sherry-like manner has to be called something else. Many have settled on the Apera (a play on Aperitif) name. See the "Protection of Sherry" in the Sherry &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherry" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are several other wines produced in the world using the Solera system and these include spanish Brandy, Marsala, Mavrodafni, Glenfiddich whisky, some Champagne, awamori in Japan and is well covered in your link in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solera" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Glühwein is part of a larger category of heated and spiced wines called Mulled Wines. They are popular all over Europe and go by more names than I can cite here. The tradition is first recorded in ancient Rome in the 2nd Century.

					&lt;p&gt;In Brazil, we have some festivities on July, and in this period it's common to drink warm and hot wine, pure, or with some fruits and spices. It's called "quentão" and is usually made with cubes of apple and cinnamon. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sweden - and by extension Scandinavia - has Glögg, which is also a mulled wine, albeit more often spiced with cloves, cinnamon and the like compared to the Glühwein I've tasted.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In addition, one may add a shot (Schuss) of brandy to Glühwein, whereas Glögg most often already contains additional alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This really depends on the drink itself. Some wines are meant to keep for years. Others should be drunk immediately. Most should be drunk within 1 or 2 years. So choose your wine carefully. There are various vintage wine guides online.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, once you have chosen a wine meant for ageing, you do want a cellar (or if that is not available, a refrigerator designed for the purpose) that will be able to give you consistent:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Temperature: around 12-13 C (55 F)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Humidity: around 70 percent&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Light: keep wines out of sunlight or even bright lights&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And if the bottles have cork stoppers, they need to be stored on their side to prevent the cork drying out. This isn't an issue with screw tops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And that's pretty much it. If you don't have a cooler or cellar, keeping them in a cool, dark cupboard is still going to help...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I did a deep dive into Stack Exchange because I thought this question would've been asked before! But, it has not. That doesn't mean that the answer isn't super easy to find. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First of all, not all wines are meant to be aged. The vast majority of wines are meant to consume when you pick them up at the store. How can you tell which are which? Mainly on price (although not always the case). As the price point goes higher, these wines have been made with aging in mind and many times are unpalatable at a younger age. Red wines are meant to age longer because the tannins (the thing that gives red wine it's color) are an anti-oxidant. Some white wines like Riesling can age for decades. Champagnes can age for a long time, but because of their delicate nature and the cork and the whole CO2 pressure thing, they are harder to age. I've had some nicely aged Champagnes. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So basically, keep it in the dark and as close to freezing as possible. Some say that 55F is the best temperature, but actually the closer to freezing you get makes it keep longer. The problem is that for bottles with corks you should have a relatively high humidity so the corks don't dry out. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The myth that wines with screw caps don't age has been debunked by the Australian wine industry because the have mostly moved to screw caps and the wines age just fine if differently than bottles with corks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging_of_wine" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Aging of Wine&lt;/a&gt; from Wikipedia pretty much tells you the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Within the Catholic Church and traverse many international borders mulled wine is a favourite drink in many a Catholic homes on the &lt;strong&gt;Feast of the Apostle St. John (December 27).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Of Course mulled wine is a very popular tradition on this day and throughout the Christmas season.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;St. John the Apostle, is the disciple "whom Jesus loved". It is a custom in the old countries to drink of "St. John's Love". The Church provided a special blessing of wine in honour of the Saint. According to legend St. John drank a glass of poisoned wine without suffering harm because he had blessed it before he drank. The wine is also a symbol of the great love of Christ that filled St. John's heart with loyalty, courage and enthusiasm for his Master; he alone of all the apostles was not afraid to stay close to Our Lord during the Passion and Crucifixion. - &lt;a href="https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/prayers/view.cfm?id=965" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;St. John's Wine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Nowadays the faithful drink mulled wine (Glühwein) on the Feast of St. John. Many different cultures still take part in this tradition.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;This hot mulled wine can be served on St. John's feast day. On St. John's Day, the Roman Ritual tells us that "wine offered by the faithful is blessed in remembrance and in honour of St. John who without any ill effects drank a cup of poisoned wine." It was by faith that St. John was saved, and through the mystical union became the disciple whom the Lord loved best. By love and faith man comes to God. We, too, pray as members of the mystical body. - &lt;a href="https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/recipes/view.cfm?id=193" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;St. John's Wine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Then there is the Nordic Glögg mulled wine tradition which is served on &lt;strong&gt;St. Lucy's Day (December 13)&lt;/strong&gt; in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Glögg, gløgg, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gl%C3%B6gi" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;glögi&lt;/a&gt; and similar words are the terms used for mulled wine in the Nordic countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;In Sweden, ginger bread and lussebullar (also called lussekatter), a type of sweet bun with saffron and raisins, are typically served on December 13 to celebrate &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucy%27s_Day" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Saint Lucia's Day&lt;/a&gt;. It is also traditionally served at the julbord, the Christmas version of the classic, Swedish buffet smörgåsbord. In Denmark, gløgg pairings typically include æbleskiver sprinkled with powdered sugar and accompanied with strawberry marmalade. In Norway, gløgg is paired with rice pudding (Norwegian: riskrem). In such cases, the word graut-/grøtfest is more precise, taking the name from the rice pudding which is served as a course. Typically, gløgg is drunk before eating the rice pudding, which is often served with cold, red cordial (saus). - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulled_wine" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Mulled Wine (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Many European countries including Germany celebrate &lt;strong&gt;Silvesterabend (New Yerar's Eve)&lt;/strong&gt; with mulled wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Austria, and its neighbour to the north, Germany, call New Year's Eve Silvesterabend, or the eve of Saint Sylvester. Austrian revelers drink a red wine punch with cinnamon and spices, eat suckling pig for dinner and decorate the table with little pigs made of marzipan, called Marzipanschwein. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/new-years-food-traditions/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;New Year's food traditions around the world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The last day of the year is called "Sylvester" in Europe. This word is derived from the liturgical feast, celebrated on December 31, of St. Sylvester, pope and confessor, who died in the fourth century.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The end of the old and the beginning of the new year was, and still is, observed with popular devotional exercises. Special services are held in many churches on New Year's Eve to thank God for all His favours in the past year and to implore His blessings for the new one.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;A distinctive feature of the traditional celebration is the feasting and merrymaking during the night, often combined with masquerades, singing, and noisemaking. This is a relic of the pre-Christian reveling in ancient Rome; its original significance was to salute the New Year and to drive the demons away.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The main item of Sylvester drinking is the punch bowl. Today we have quite a variety of punches. The modern form of punch originated in England in the early seventeenth century. It consists of alcohol, water, spice, sugar, fruit essence. The word seems to be an abbreviation of "puncheon," which was the name of the cask from which grog used to be served on English ships. - &lt;a href="https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/recipes/view.cfm?id=926" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Mulled Wine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In Russia we call it глинтвейн (glintveyn), and I believe the central ingredient is a melted sugar. Maybe not so much for the taste, but for the magic. It is important for the entire party to watch its making.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sorry could not resist, here is how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of time make a strong sirup and let it recrystallize in a cylindric mold, about 1" thick, and as long as your saucepan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put wine and spices into the saucepan and bring to a slow heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soak sugar cylinder in brandy and arrange it above the wine (you'd need some metal frame to hold it).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the magic: set it on fire, and watch the sugar melting and dropping into the heated wine. Keep pouring brandy over sugar as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The process is not easy, but once you've mastered it, your success at the party is guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your liking one wine over another is a purely subjective practice. This is what makes picking out wines so difficult and expensive because you have to try it before you'll really know if you like it. Some people enjoy the journey and others want to be told what to buy. My suggestion is to try as many Malbecs as you can afford. Narrow down wineries and regions that you like. Let's say you figure out you like Chilean Malbecs or Washington State ones, then I think you know that a region will have similar flavors. Unfortunately, that's probably all we can do for you. So, just get out there and taste as many as you can!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Farmersteve's answer is good but I'd like to add a little extra to consider. You've only tried wines made with two grapes. The world of wine is much broader than this. The popular red grapes include Pinot Noir, Grenache, Syrah, and many others. Also, there are wines made from blends of grapes such as found in the Southern Rhone. What I do recommend is seeing if you have a good local wine store. I'm lucky to have access to a few and you can get good advice from the salespeople. Good stores won't look down on you for starting with inexpensive wines. A lot of shops have free tastings which is a great way to try different wines without investing in a whole bottle. I was a bit confused by you implying you have had white Malbec. Malbec is a red wine grape and while it might be possible to make a white wine from it, I've never heard of one and it would certainly be uncommon. If you are getting started, you should probably try Chardonnays and Sauvignon Blancs for white wines although there are lots of other white wine grapes. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The taste of a wine derives from ...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;the grape variety&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;the ripening conditions of the grapes (includes climate, region, year, nutrients etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;secondary fermentation (type oak, time etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;yeast strain(s) (cultivated or wild etc)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;style (e.g. beaujolais, ice wine etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Information about the secondary fermentation could give you an idea how the wine tastes, especially about oak tannins. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Information about the yeast strains would most likely either be a trade secret or a mix of wild yeasts that depends on the natural blend that occurred in that year in that particular vineyard. This is, at least to some extent, what creates the difference between "a good vintage" and a bad one.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The effect of the grape variety on the actual taste is often overrated. Oak flavours are sometimes more dominant than most people would imagine and the same variety grown in different regions can create entirely different profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instead of looking for certain varieties, I would suggest considering information about wine regions, vineyards, alcohol content and, if given, descriptions on tannins, oak and fruit flavours. Third party reviews might help but there is never a guarantee that they are in any way correct.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;IBU is btw a bad way to measure bitterness in most beers where is matters. It entirely neglects large portions of the flavour profile found in hops, in particular those that give an IPA its typical taste. The bitterness also changes with time, which is not accounted for either. Bitterness also changes with stronger beers. The higher the malt content, the more hops you need to compensate for the same taste.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As noted in a comment Malbec is only red.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The common term is wine producer.  Sometimes referred to as label. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In (nominal) order the factors are&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Grape&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Region / vineyard  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Year&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Producer / process &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Malbec has a pretty broad range.  Initially was used almost exclusively as a blending wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A cheaper wine is going to have more variance.  They are often buying a grape from an number of vineyards.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are publications.  Find a wine reviewer that you match their taste.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;At your wine store get to know one of knowledgeable sales people.  Ask for advice and then next time tell them what you thought of the wine.  They will get to know your taste.  Or you might tell them some of wines you like and ask for a recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Go to wine tasting were you get to sample a number of wines.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Why do some wines taste salty?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ed C. Kraus, a 3rd generation home brewer/winemaker and has been an owner of E. C. Kraus since 1999 has 4 possible reasons why a wine may have a salty taste. He has been helping individuals make better wine and beer for over 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;My first thought would be that if you are aging in a wooden barrel, the remnant salts from the sodium metabisulfite may have built up over the years through insufficient rinsing or no rinsing at all. But this is very unlikely. If you make any kind of conscious effort to rinse a barrel you would be able to keep up with the trace amount of salts that are left behind with each wine batch. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;My second thought is that a mistake was made in a dosage added to a wine/must. For instance, yeast nutrient (diammonium phosphate) would add what some would call a salty taste to the wine if too much were added, but this would take many times the normal recommend dosage.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Third would be saltiness from the grapes themselves. This could add a salty taste in wine. This could apply if you made the wine from fresh grapes from a vineyard. The mineral content of the soil is always reflected in the grape’s flavor to some degree. This is one of the reasons a grape’s origin is always noted. If you are making wine for the first time from a particular soil or terroir, then this is what could be going on.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The fourth thing that comes to mind is a mold infection. The only reason I left this for last is because it is the least likely of the four. This is because by the time the wine has a salty taste from mold, it is already blatantly obvious from a visual inspection that mold as set in. So if you don’t see any patches of dried crust on the surface anywhere, or a rainbow-ed, oil-slick look on the wine’s surface, the salty taste in the wine is not being caused by a mold.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Beyond these things the only thing that comes to mind is accidentally putting salt in the wine. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes, wine can pretty much be made from all edible fruit, &lt;a href="http://edibleroadtrip.com/blog/2014/1/2/6tjqenl9lxr9h0vyk54aob7hms68f0" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;including tomatoes&lt;/a&gt;. But the reason we make wine out of grapes is three fold. Sugar, tannins and acids. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sugar&lt;/strong&gt;. Grapes produce the highest naturally occurring amount of sugar of any fruit. Almost no other fruit comes close. Grapes have the ability to make wines that are anywhere from 10-18% alcohol and even higher in the case of late harvest grapes that have too much sugar to finish alcohol production. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acid&lt;/strong&gt;. Grapes have a very high naturally occurring acid levels coming from Tartaric acid. Acids help preserve wine and keep the nasty bugs from eating the sugar. They also make it more drinkable. Wine without any acid is flat and awful. It's like beer without hops.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tannin&lt;/strong&gt;. Red and white grapes contain tannin in both the skins and seeds. These are a natural antioxidant that help preserve the wine for long term storage. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Since grapes have such natural high sugar levels, they also have large colonies of yeast on the skin (aka the bloom) and because of this, grapes are a complete package requiring nothing else to make a high alcohol beverage that can be stored for a very long time without spoiling. No other fruit has the right combination of attributes to do this on it's own.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If they can make wine out of durian fruit, then one can make wine out of any fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most people find the taste or flavor of this fruit disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In fact durians are not allowed on the Singapore subway or on many commercial flights at all.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/78FeG.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/78FeG.jpg" alt="Sign informing that Durian fruit is not allowed inside the Singapore subway"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durian" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Sign informing that Durian fruit is not allowed inside the Singapore subway.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yet durians can be made into wine and what is great about it, is the fact that the durian wine is devoid of its' pungent smell.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;It's a formidable feat pulled off by a team of student researchers at the National University of Singapore who hope to commercialize their durian wine and see the product on store shelves.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Known as both the "King of Fruits" and the world's stinkiest fruit, the durian is likewise perhaps the most polarizing food with people who either love it hate it.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;After testing out different fermentation methods, the end result is a &lt;strong&gt;wine of 6 percent alcohol which is devoid of the fruit's pungent smell.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/eats/world-stinkiest-fruit-turned-wine-article-1.1411504" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;World's stinkiest fruit is turned into wine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the others, I'll say &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt;, at least if you're going to have some reasonable definition of the word "wine". Fruits which will produce no fermentable juices are simply not going to work. If you have to treat the fruits in such a way as to convert starches in order to get sugars to ferment, can you really call the product a "wine", even in a loose sense?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You are going to struggle mightily to produce wine from avocados or eggplants, for example... even limes are so low in sugar and high in acidity that even after neutralizing some acid you will have to add a bunch of sugar to have anything to ferment... in this case, you're really making a flavored kilju, rather than a wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And if you want to get technical about fruits, then "all fruits" is actually a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit#Simple_fruit" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;very broad category&lt;/a&gt;. Brazil nuts, &lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Acer_circinatum_26294.JPG" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;maple keys&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Carrot_seeds_in_Uzbekistan.JPG" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;carrot seeds&lt;/a&gt; are all fully-fledged fruits that are going to be very difficult or impossible to extract a fermentable juice from.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Of course, you could probably use a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_oryzae" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;koji&lt;/a&gt; to first saccharify your initial base and produce something like a sake, but despite the colloquial misnomer "rice wine", if you're going to call this a wine, then you can do it with nearly anything: why limit yourself to fruits? Then is there really a further difference with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kvass" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;kvass&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumis" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;kumis&lt;/a&gt;. Is beer now wine?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is completely discounting the whole classes of toxic fruits that you might be able to produce something technically alcoholic but definitely nondrinkable from, e.g. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atropa_belladonna" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;belladonna&lt;/a&gt; and other toxic nightshades, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actaea_pachypoda" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;baneberries&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Pairing rules are not set in stone, but there are a few friendly guidline to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Match Wine Flavors With Food Flavors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Specific body and color types and their flavors are also elements to consider when you are pairing vegan foods and wine. For example, when choosing white wine, a light-bodied flavor, such as Vermentino, Pinot Grigio and Viognier all go well with pasta dishes, salads and stir-fry vegetables because they will not overpower the modest flavor of these foods. If you are barbecuing veggie burgers or preparing baked potatoes on the grill, consider choosing a classic white Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc or Riesling, which make a fine complement to the taste of grilled foods. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;If you prefer red wine, then go with Granache for veggie burgers and sweet potatoes, and try a Merlot for olive-based dishes and grilled asparagus. The most important aspect of pairing wine with a vegan meal is to choose flavors that will not overpower the food. For example, avoid pairing a robust, full-bodied red wine with a simple summer salad or pairing a sweet wine with a tart pesto and lemon dish. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;While you might make a few errors when you first start pairing wines and vegan dishes, you should never be afraid to experiment and come up with a few interesting combinations of you own. - &lt;a href="https://learn.winecoolerdirect.com/vegan-wine-pairings/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;5 Tips for Pairing Wines With Vegan Dishes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And by the way: &lt;strong&gt;Bon Appetite!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These guys aren't claiming that it's Noah's wine, but they are saying they are using the same methods that they used 8000 years ago to make wine and you can buy it in the Republic of Georgia. &lt;a href="http://%20https://medium.com/@foodmatters/is-georgias-ancient-wine-making-method-making-a-comeback-fd54db9946dc" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Is Georgia's Ancient Wine Making Method Making a Comeback?&lt;/a&gt; You can buy it around the world supposedly. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Kvevri wines from Georgia can be found in a few stores and restaurants in New York City, San Francisco and Washington DC. Noel Brockett, who distributes both conventional and kvevri wine from Georgia in Washington DC for the Georgia Wine House, says it may take time to reach the general public but, “the Sommelier community is definitely becoming much more interested in the kvevri wines as the general market turns toward authenticity.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Other than trying something out for historical purposes, the wine probably didn't taste all that great. They probably drank it young since they didn't have bottles and it was likely very cloudy and low alcohol. Probably not red since that would require fermenting on the skins in a controlled manner. Probably like a cloudy rose' or a orangeish white. We'll never know what grapes were used by Noah.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karasì&lt;/strong&gt; is not designed to resemble that of Noah's wine, but it may have some small characteristics of the grapes Noah used.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karasì&lt;/strong&gt;, is a tribute to the 6100 year wine tradition of Armenia. Aged in traditional amphorae, hence its name, ‘from amphorae’ in Armenia, this wine embraces the living heritage of a country while at the same time it delves back into a long forgotten chapter in the ancient history of wine.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grape Variety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The King of Armenia’s grapes and possibly one of the oldest grape varieties in the world Areni has been present in Armenia for millennia. Never grafted and on its own roots, it is 100% indigenous to this land with a unique DNA proﬁle that does not match any other. Elegant and fresh, thick skinned and extremely resistant to disease, through the ages Areni has adapted perfectly to the high altitudes and extreme temperatures variations of Vayots Dzor, its natural habitat.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;With Karasì we have the pleasure of tasting both place and the exotic personality of an ancient grape most have never heard of! - &lt;a href="https://www.zorahwines.com/karasi/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Karasì&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cradle of Vine and Wine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;One of the world’s oldest civilizations, steeped in a history and tradition that dates back millennia, Armenia’s territory lies in the southern Trans Caucasus in the highlands surrounding Biblical Mount Ararat. The Cradle of Vine and Wine, the vine has forever been present in the valleys of Armenia with the wild Vitis vinifera silvestris, ancestor of the cultivated vinifera vine species, already established in its highlands over a million years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;It is also of course in Armenia, at the foothills of Biblical Mount Ararat, where legend has Noah, the world’s first vigneron, plant his vineyards and later became famously drunk on his own wine! - &lt;a href="https://www.zorahwines.com/armenia/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Armenia: The land of the beginning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Championing Native Varieties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Working uniquely with ancient native varieties the vines are planted on their own roots directly into rocky, limestone soils which have never seen Phylloxera and while ZORAH’S heirloom vineyards tell a story of times gone by, the younger vines, the cuttings of which come from ancient abandoned vineyards of a XIIIth Century monastery, show us vistas into a possible future. - &lt;a href="https://www.zorahwines.com/vineyards/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Zorah Wines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's simply grade inflation. I have won a few Double Golds at the Seattle Wine Awards. Contests were giving out too many Golds and they came up with Double Golds. Here is how it normally works. Judges sit around a table and taste together. Then they discuss and award medals as a group. If the majority thinks it's worth a gold, they give it a gold. If the whole table says it's a gold, then they give it a double gold.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are Platinum awards too. Another group of judges (not from the same contest) taste all the Double Golds from a region or something from other contests and give Platinums. It's all a subjective thing based on the contest. There is no coordination among contests on what a double gold means. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Is mulled wine just for Christmas?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The short answer is &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Drinking mulled wine anytime of the year is more than okay. It can create an excellent atmosphere if done tastefully. I have served it myself on Easter Day to guests at my place and all enjoyed the spiced wine. Okay it was a little cold outside still, but that is besides the point. I live in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In Brazil, they drink &lt;strong&gt;Quentão&lt;/strong&gt;, a type of mulled wine especially during summer festivals.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;In Brazil, we have some festivities on July, and in this period it's common to drink warm and hot wine, pure, or with some fruits and spices. It's called "quentão" and is usually made with cubes of apple and cinnamon. &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/a/7277/5064"&gt;Res&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some recipes use &lt;strong&gt;cachaça&lt;/strong&gt; (sugar cane brandy) in lieu of wine and is served very hot. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"Quentão " is a traditional "Festas Juninas" (winter party) grog cocktail, especially in the South Region, the coldest area of Brazil. Its irresistible scents combine sweet and spicy notes and it is traditionally served hot in small earthenware, ceramic or thick glass cups, which retain heat well. 
					  It is a very popular cocktail recipe in the rural areas, and probably made its first appearance in the hinterland of São Paulo and Minas Gerais states. In absence of formal information, one would assume that this recipe is a variation of European mulled wine and grog recipes, made with "cachaça", the Brazilian national sugar cane spirits. In the 18th and 19th Centuries the consumption of "cachaça" has become synonymous of "Brazilianness" against Portuguese domination. After the "Modern Art Week " of 1922 it becomes a symbol of Brazilian cultural autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The word "quentão" is derived from "quente" which means hot, plus the augmentative suffix -"ão" (literally very hot). At the beginning of the 20th Century it came to designate the "drink made by boiling sugar cane spirits with sugar, ginger and cinnamon. -  &lt;a href="https://www.saborbrasil.it/en/ricettas/140" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Quentão&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One last note!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.spirithillswinery.com/?page_id=904" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonfire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is taking Southern Alberta by storm, and it is warming hearts and melting colds.  It is a traditional European winter wine but also warms you up on cool summer nights. Bonfire is pre-mulled, so the only thing you need to do is warm the wine in either a pot or microwave. It is crafted from black currants, saskatoons, cinnamon and cloves.  The berry notes make it a great base for a perfectly balanced mulled wine and provide a much smoother finish than the traditional mulled wine made with grape wine due to the absence of tannins. Drinking it will make you feel like Christmas, no matter which time of the year.  It will warm you to the bone after a day of skiing, hockey, tobogganing, ice fishing, or around the bonfire on cool summer nights.  The perfect wine for Alberta winter and summer camping enjoyments. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonfire&lt;/strong&gt; pairs great with Alberta weather winter weather and summer nights.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Red wines generally benefit from aging. In the right conditions, dark and cool, tannins can smooth out removing some of their bite. Flavors can mellow and blend into something very interesting to the palette.  Whites usually can follow suit, but their life span sans a few specific varieties, usually aren’t meant for aging and should be drunk young.  IMO few wines are really geared for long aging, notably ports, with their high alcohol levels age well into several decades, giving the drinker unique flavors as the years go by.  However, if a wine is flawed at conception, aging won’t make a purse out of a sow’s ear.&lt;/p&gt;
