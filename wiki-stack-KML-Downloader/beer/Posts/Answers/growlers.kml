					&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there's not much one can do, at least using only household products.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While filling, using a counterpressure bottle filler would maximize the longevity of the beer as well as filling the beer while it's very cold, near its freezing point ~29 degrees F (so that its CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is maximally dissolved), if you have a choice in the matter (likely not).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Once opening the growler over multiple sessions, however, it's not the ineffectiveness of the seal (using a swing-top growler should do just fine) as much as it is the growing amounts of air that get sealed within.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Supposedly washing your hair with it has some nice effects,
					and people have found other creative uses: 
					&lt;a href="http://en.rocketnews24.com/2013/12/27/how-to-make-good-use-of-flat-leftover-beer-from-your-christmas-party/" rel="nofollow"&gt;How to make good use of flat, leftover beer from your Christmas party&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, if it is only a few days old and has been in the fridge, it's unlikely that it's done much more than go completely flat, so any use that doesn't require it to be carbonated would be fitting. -- I'd go for the bread.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You could use it to make steak and ale pie, this works particularly well with darker beers. Although you don't need much - about 1 cup / 220ml.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In my experience,  many recipes that call for beer either work fine with flat beer or call for it that way.  Examples include chili, fish poached in beer,  and some stews.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would be reluctant to use it for bread unless the recipe calls for a "normal" amount of yeast,  though.  Some recipes seem to rely on the yeast in the beer and others add bread yeast,  so check in order to avoid baking a hockey puck. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is for conventional bread.  If you're making a quick bread that uses baking soda,  you don't need help from the beer for rising.  (Thanks waxeagle.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Making it into a marinade for steaks would work.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Depending on the type of beer, I would also consider using it for boiling sausages/bratwurst with it.  Though I find that the darker beers are the best for this.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'd definitely say cook with it as others have mentioned. You're really just trying to impart &lt;strong&gt;some&lt;/strong&gt; of the beer flavors into the food; you don't really need a fresh beer to do that as carbonation doesn't affect the flavor, it affects the mouth-feel. The carbonation from a fresh beer would be lost in cooking anyway. If it's only been 2 days, it probably hasn't spoiled, so you're fine. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer bred is always an option. I also saw someone else on here mention &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/312/what-type-of-beer-should-be-used-in-making-beer-soup-polewka-piwna/318#318"&gt;Polish Beer Soup&lt;/a&gt;.
					Beer-battered fish is another option. I could go on and on with recipes though. The &lt;a href="http://brooklynbrewshop.com/themash/category/cookingwithbeer/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Brooklyn Brew Shop&lt;/a&gt; has a lot of interesting ones that I've never seen before, such as french toast (might be good with a chocolate stout or other dessert stout) and beer braised greens. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Household uses include trapping insects in your home, washing hair, fertilizing plants, cleaning wood furniture, &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2011/08/09/14-household-uses-for-beer/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;etc&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;They can, provided that they:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Cover up existing labels&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Add their own label containing the brewery name, beer name, and abv.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Are a brewery (bars and retailers cannot).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You're not alone in being confused, though.  A lot of breweries didn't really know either, and as a result decided not to, just to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Further complicating the issue is that many breweries just don't want to, either because they make money on &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; growlers or because it's a pain to deal with the labeling when their bar is busy.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;SFGate has &lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/wine/brew/article/California-eases-up-on-buying-beer-to-go-4888968.php"&gt;a decent article&lt;/a&gt; for further reading.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In 2001, Florida State Senator Tom Lee championed a bill which was passed that allowed for more sizes of beer containers to be sold in Florida. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Prior to the bill passing, only 12 ounce, 16 ounce or 32 ounce packaging was allowed. This prevented most craft beers from entering the state and to allow those entry, the law enacted stated that anything under 32 ounces or over 1 gallon would now be allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The unintended side affect of this law was that anything in between that range was still banned, including the 64 ounce container. 3 years ago, there was a bill written which would allow the sale of a 64 ounce container in Florida, but it was not sent to the floor for a vote because it involved other caveats with regards to craft breweries in the state. The main reason a vote was not taken was that the legislature felt that there should be more consideration taken to assist the craft brewers. Although that bill was stopped, the movement is still ongoing to have these container sizes legalized.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It isn't that half-gallon growlers are specifically illegal as such, but more of a quirk of how the different types and sizes of legal containers are defined.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Florida laws governing beer (or more accurately "malt beverage") container sizes specify that:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Individual containers of malt beverage sold or offered for sale shall
					  be no larger than 32 ounces.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The above law does not apply to malt beverages packaged "in bulk"
					  which is defined as a keg or "other individual container" containing 1
					  gallon or more of malt beverage.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So it isn't really that 32oz and 1 gallon growlers are legal and 64oz growlers aren't, it's that a 32oz container is the largest legal sized individual container, and a gallon is the smallest legal container for "bulk" packaging exempt from the  maximum container size regulation.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This outlines the basic laws for all states.  &lt;a href="http://www.brewersassociation.org/pages/government-affairs/growler-laws" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.brewersassociation.org/pages/government-affairs/growler-laws&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Growlers permitted under manufacturer license: Yes&lt;br&gt;
					Growlers permitted under brewpub license: Yes&lt;br&gt;
					Growlers permitted under retailer license: Yes&lt;br&gt;
					Specific "growler" language in statute: No  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is a link to the actual laws in Massachusetts on the this page too&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And since some people can't follow links, I'll do the research for them so they have the answers to their questions. First when looking for answers to legal questions ask a lawyer not random people on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"(i.e., that breweries are not able to fill growlers other than those with their own logo/which they themselves distribute)"&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Reading the laws and talking to some people the answer is yes you have to purchase the growler from the brewery.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It appears that there may be several laws in play here, but perhaps the interpretation of those laws by the Massachusetts  Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission, the brewers, and the Mass Brewers Guild that determine how growler fills work in practice.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The first law in question is the &lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/abcc/regulations.htm#LicensesandPermits6"&gt;regulation on labeling&lt;/a&gt;.  Nothing in there &lt;em&gt;appears&lt;/em&gt; to prevent brewers from filling any growler, but the standard interpretation from both the ABCC and the brewers is that they believe it makes it illegal for them to fill any growlers other than their own, and that is the policy by which they seem to all operate.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for retail establishments, there do seem to be some non-brewery bars that offer growlers, (see Ducali Pizzeria and Bar on &lt;a href="http://growlerdirectory.com/growler-stations/Massachusetts-MA"&gt;this list&lt;/a&gt;) but those may be for on-premise use.  There was a proposal for a bill to allow on-premise / off-premise licensees to do growler fills but as far as I can tell, it died in committee, primarily due to strong opposition from craft brewers who were worried it would cut into their bottle profits.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Beyond issues of distribution, the joint legislative committee also heard from industry members interested in allowing both on- and off-premise retailers to fill beer containers up to 64 ounces for take-away and off-site consumption. The bill, sponsored by Representative William Pignatelli, has caused some division in the industry between retailers and small brewers. “We think it would be a disaster for our business by cannibalizing our bottle sales, our only real income source,” says one small Massachusetts brewer. “We for one couldn't thrive in a situation where the profit on bottled beer transfers from brewery to store or bar.”&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is what the PA Liquor Control Board has to say:
					&lt;a href="http://www.lcbapps.lcb.state.pa.us/webapp/legal/PublicAdvOpnDisplay.asp?opinion_year=2012&amp;amp;opinion_sequence=470" rel="nofollow"&gt;PA LCB answer to legality of selling growlers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, a growler is an open container, but it is up to the local police or state police to decide whether or not to enforce the law. My guess is that if the growler is full and out of your easy reach, you are probably OK unless you have given the cop some reason to hassle you. As I read the law, you are 100% legal if the growler is in the trunk of the car.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the growler is empty and clean (at least rinsed out), I think they would have a hard time pressing a case. If there is any beer or residue in it, then keep it in the trunk.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The biggest impact tends to be the color of the container. Green and clear bottles let in more of the harmful light that spoils the beer. The darker the container, the better.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Plastic also lends itself to being scratched if re-used (which most growlers are). Even powdered cleaners with soft cloths can scratch the plastic (if the cleaner isn't disolved well enough) and make grooves where bacteria can sit and ruin future beers. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While it isn't the only choice: Dark Colored, glass growlers that have an air-tight seal would be the best for longevity sake. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've had the best luck using brown or dark glass growlers. Glass is one of the most inert food-storage materials. The effect on taste of beer from different material containers is similar to the effect that drinking water from different material containers has.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Using metal can sometimes impart a flavor to the beer, though medical-grade (316) stainless steel should be as inert as glass, which is why it's used in a lot of brewing equipment. Not all stainless steel is up to this task, though - make sure to check which alloy the containers are made from. Some will rust over time, despite the "stainless" designation! Passivation of the material's inside surface is also helpful - this creates a very thin layer of metal oxide material on metals that will not react with the liquid stored inside. (The growler you linked to is passivated, for example.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Plastics definitely can impart a flavor into beer or other drinks, and are difficult to keep sanitized / free of scratches and bacteria. I'd avoid this where possible, though you may find it is fine for taste if you drink the beer quickly enough.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most places (generally everywhere and certainly in Bay Area) allow only their own growlers to be filled with their beer. Thus if you buy a Growler from ISO Beers, they will not fill it at Original Gravity 2 blocks away (both very decent places).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is just not good business - they want you to come in and pay premium on their single draft beers. So if you want to take some to go they want to at least win your loyalty by giving you discount on Growler fill, but make sure you come back to their brewery.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My favorite place to fill up a growler is Hopdogma near Half Moon Bay.  It's worth the drive up from San Jose or down from San Francisco on a beautiful day.  You can see the ocean from the bar as well and it's a great place to have a pint!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's not quite the South Bay but close. I've seen them fill growlers that do not have their name on them. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://steelheadbrewery.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Steelhead Brewing Company&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;333 California Dr&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Burlingame, CA 94010&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;United States&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you like IPAs or APAs, the Bombay Bomber and the Double Play are worth a try. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another option is to &lt;a href="https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/9683/how-to-make-malt-vinegar"&gt;make your own malt vinegar&lt;/a&gt;.  You can just put a piece of cheesecloth over the top (with the cap removed), or you could add a little vinegar mother, like from the bottom of a "natural" bottle of vinegar, and it will turn it to vinegar for you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've seen a lot of people commenting to cook with it , which is my advice , but I haven't seen someone speaking about crepes.
					I don't know if we only do this here (france) but I've always used beer to make crepes and it's realy great. I recently thought about using strong flavored beers (like dark ones) but didn't try it yet so if you try it soon a feedback would be appreciated ! &lt;/p&gt;
