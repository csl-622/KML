					&lt;p&gt;Beer might be completely undrinkable if the water is poor quality. Usually it is ok to use your own tap water, but if it is softened, you'll want to buy bottled water, as the added sodium from the softener will ruin your beer. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I personally use purchased water from the grocery store. Usually 50% distilled, 50% "spring". Though honestly it's probably all tap water from somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most of beer is water, so it is vitally important.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here in Atlanta, we have some of the better tap water compared to many cities, but Monday Night Brewing in particular takes all minerals and chemicals out of the water and adds back in the appropriate properties to match the style of beer that they are trying to brew.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;They emulate the water from the origin of the beer style. Just consider that anything but the most pure form of water will impart some taste in your beer good or bad and is worth being aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Water is extremely important. When touring Brooklyn Brewery, the brewers went on and on about how great it is for them to have access to the NYC water supply.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;During brewing, the quality of the water is important because the minerals can affect a beer recipe greatly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Well, this question might get closed as a duplicate, but I'm going to answer it anyway, and try to answer it better. IMO, the suggested duplicate answers a &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; question, only answering the hydration question too, by side-effect. Personally, I like &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; question paired with &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; answer, better than &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; question.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h3&gt;tl;dr — Alcohol is a diuretic (defined: &lt;em&gt;a substance that promotes the production of urine&lt;/em&gt;), causing you to expel more water than the body would normally expel.&lt;/h3&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That much has been shown conclusively.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;If sufficient alcohol is ingested, the diuresis occurs at the expense of all cellular components, and dehydration ensues.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=568848"&gt;Roberts, K. E. Mechanism of Dehydration Following Alcohol Ingestion. 1963. [Abstract (HTML)]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far back as the 1930s, researchers were trying to understand whether alcohol—the substance itself—is a diuretic, or indirectly induces chemicals which are diuretic (or which inhibit antidiuretics) or triggers cortical functions that cause diuresis.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;[Most] writers either state categorically or imply that alcohol per se has no diuretic action. In 1932, however, from a comparison of the diuretic effects of a given volume of water, with and without alcohol, [...] Murray concluded that alcohol itself was exerting a diuretic action. [...] The diuretic action of alcohol has now been demonstrated on five other subjects, and its mode of action investigated [...]&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://jp.physoc.org/content/101/2/172.full.pdf"&gt;Eggleton, M. G. The Diuretic Action of Alcohol in Man. 1941. [Full Paper (PDF)]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The first paper (1963) actually confirmed that &lt;strong&gt;alcohol—yes, ethanol itself—inhibits antidiuretic hormones, causing diuresis, causing dehydration.&lt;/strong&gt; (Caffeine does this too, by the way.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, yeah. That's how that happens.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Unrelated, but I found this interesting in the second paper...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;It [the diuresis] is initiated by the &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; in blood-alcohol concentration and fails to be maintained if this concentration is kept steady, even at high levels [...] The diuretic response to alcohol differs markedly in one respect from that of the cerebral cortex. The latter is most affected by the &lt;em&gt;rate&lt;/em&gt; of increase in blood-alcohol concentration: the greater this rate of increase, the greater the disturbance of function at any absolute concentration. The diuretic response, on the other hand, is dependent mainly on the &lt;em&gt;duration&lt;/em&gt; of increasing blood-alcohol concentration and not on the rate of increase (Tables 6, 7). The naturally slow absorber, therefore, tends to give a larger diuretic response than the rapid absorber.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The slower you get drunk, the more dehydrated you'll be!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's important enough that many British brewers modify the composition of their water to more closely mimic the mineral content of water drawn from wells near &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burton_upon_Trent" rel="nofollow"&gt;Burton upon Trent&lt;/a&gt;, where traditional styles are considered to originate from. This process is called &lt;em&gt;Burtonisation&lt;/em&gt;. I've noticed for my part that some traditional bitters I've drunk have had a noticeable and not entirely pleasant aroma somewhat like old eggs, which I would guess is the sulphur content that is added in this process. I don't particularly care for beers that taste like this, but each to their own.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Water is the primary ingredient in beer.  In my opinion, the water quality is more important than anything else.  I believe in drinking beer for health, and as I don't drink dirty municipal water, why would I drink beer from it?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Just think about city water from a second.  Much of it comes from the same river that the sewage is dumped in.  Just because the stink has been taken out of it with carbon filters, does that make it tasty to you?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, I don't believe in drinking sodium fluoride.  No rat poison in my beer, thank you.  I don't care how many people say that it's in there for your smile.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When I buy commercial beer, my primary criteria is the water.  If it is fluoridated, no thanks.  If it is spring water, super thanks!  Spring water is natural and it has natural minerals built in.  Also, you will notice that the finest beers have spring water.  See BFM of Switzerland and Samuel Smith of England.&lt;/p&gt;
