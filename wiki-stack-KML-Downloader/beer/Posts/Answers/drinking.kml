					&lt;p&gt;Alcohol is a diuretic.  According to &lt;a href="http://www.drinkaware.co.uk/check-the-facts/health-effects-of-alcohol/effects-on-the-body/why-does-alcohol-make-you-pee-more"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, 1 gram of alcohol will increase urine excretion by 10ml.  Combine that with &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/faqs.htm#standDrink"&gt;this CDC article&lt;/a&gt; stating that a standard 12 ounce (354ml) beer has 14 grams of alcohol, your can expect to pee 494ml, or 16.75 ounces per 12 ounce bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The graphic would be more accurate with you drinking three beers but peeing four.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Standards and qualifications will play a big role in how we can change the perception of beer. Wine has had the Sommelier since &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sommelier" rel="nofollow"&gt;1907&lt;/a&gt;. Beer now has the &lt;a href="http://cicerone.org/content/certified-beer-server" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cicerone&lt;/a&gt; (of which I can not find a date when the certification program started). Just look at the Wikipedia difference between the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_sommelier" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cicerone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sommelier" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sommelier&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Remember, wine has the "low-brow" wines that are just a cheap way to get drunk.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As the craft beer industry continues to boom, we need to have more sophisticated conversations about beer. Talk about the subtleties that vary in like-beers, to be able to accurately describe mouth feel, know why head retention is critical, and grow as a community that is willing to take the time to teach those that show interest. Nothing will turn away a curious consumer like a bunch of beer snobs that act snobby. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer will always have the beers that are associated with rednecks, tailgating, insert other disparaging term here. But as a community, we also need to embrace "those types" of beer. People love them, and we don't need to change that. The people that love those beers might also be willing to branch out into other styles. Unless you are trying to convince them by attacking the beer that they love and belittle them for not having an expanded range. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Grohlier correctly mentioned the Cicerone program, but I think the next, big step will involve engaging the "cultured" crowd-- literally getting the beer into their hands.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One possible next step is fine-dining.  Beer paring dinners are becoming a popular thing in my area, and there is at least one beer-centric fine-dining restaurant that I'm aware of.  The "cultured" crowd sees wine as going hand-in-hand with food; invariably, at a wine tasting event, the host will comment, "Can't you just imagine this with a nice lamb rack"?  Beer can absolutely play in that same field, and as more restaurants or dinners offer a beer option, or are beer centric, the perception of beer will change.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's true that there are &lt;a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/human-biology/hangover3.htm"&gt;different types of hangovers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, those are mostly the result of differences in the impurities in the alcohol (that is, all the non-alcohol stuff that differentiates beer from wine from vodka).  And for those differences, it's largely the difference between different types of liquor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer is, compositionally, pretty much the same.  There might be enough difference between a heavy chocolate stout and a hoppy IPA, but between different brands of lighter beers (like pilsners), there's unlikely to be a noticeable difference in hangovers barring a weird food allergy to a minor element of one pilsner vs another.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some far more likely causes of your friends reporting worse hangovers for different brands of the same beer type are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Different quantities between evenings.  One evening you drank 10 Pilsner Urquells and the next you drink 8 Beck's.  How well are you really counting at that point?  If you think you had "about 9 beers" both nights, you might blame the worse hangover on Pilner Urquell.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Differences in alcohol level between brands.  The difference between 3.8% and 4.2% adds up after a while.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Small sample size.  Would you rely on a medical study of only 3 or 4 people?  Probably not.  Likewise, if your friend reports getting a bad hangover the last 3 or 4 times they drank Konig, it may just be a bit of coincidence, and they would have had a nasty hangover those nights regardless of what they drank.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One method I know is to have large, heavy steins kept in the freezer. That way as soon as you bring beer, you can cool it by pouring into the stein. It won't cool your lukewarm beer to optimal temperature but it will give it a good few degrees drop.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can use "reusable ice cubes", which are essentially tiny plastic bags with water - that way you won't dilute your beer. There's also a stainless steel variety, it has slightly worse heat capacity but sinks to the bottom, which is less annoying than plastic bags floating in your stein.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I read somewhere about making ice cubes &lt;em&gt;from beer&lt;/em&gt; somewhere, so that they don't dilute your beer (you need a good freezer for that though). I can't vouch if they don't affect the taste though.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A smart method though, is to use the buffer beer. Remove the "buffer beer" from the fridge, put the the lukewarm beer in the fridge, drink the buffer beer - meanwhile the beer you put in the fridge becomes your new buffer beer ;)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;edit: if you go with reusable ice cubes, use ones that contain water inside. Don't buy in to the scam of granite ice cubes or solid steel ice cubes. Their thermal capacity is abysmal. To provide the amount of temperature drop a single normal ice cube provides, you'd need to fill your glass with granite cubes to nearly the brim.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another option might be some what less conservative, but instead of using ice cubes you could also use &lt;a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/734246795/whiskey-rox-beverage-chilling-stones" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;chilling rocks&lt;/a&gt;. This is also often used as an alternative for cooling whisky without diluting it. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F9jTJ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Soapstone is a non-porous, odorless and inert stone. It is tasteless and will not absorb odors from your freezer like ice cubes do. Soapstone has a high thermal mass, giving it the natural ability to retain its temperature for extended periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are a bit more patient, you can just put the beer in the freezer for about 10 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;At the Defcon security conference in Las Vegas, the &lt;a href="http://deviating.net/bccc/"&gt;Beverage Cooling Contraption Contest&lt;/a&gt; is an exciting outdoor event.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Over the years, techniques have included adiabatic cooling (using a jet engine), dry ice, liquid nitrogen etc.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In 2008, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DS70HOdYbebc"&gt;this team managed&lt;/a&gt; to cool a keg of beer from 80F to 33F in 35 seconds using air power, dry ice and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Take a bucket. Or a bowl. Or a cooler.  Or any other similar vessel. Put your beer bottles or cans (sealed! For the love of god, sealed!) at the bottom of the bucket.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Fill it most of the way with ice. Then fill in with water until the bottles are submerged. Then throw in any remaining ice.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finally, add a volume of salt commensurate with the quantity of water, both solid and liquid, you've already got in there.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wait anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes depending on desired coldness and quantity of beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;(Rinse the rim of the bottle if you're finicky. Also, this will probably ruin the label. Sorry. Why do you care about that anyway? You weirdo.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It takes a lot of time to cool a beer bottle in fridge. But it takes much less time if you put them in freezer. However, you shouldn't forget about such bottle, if you don't want the beer to freeze and explode the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If it's not fast enough, take a few glasses, pour a bit beer into each and put them all into fridge. They will cool down much faster than the whole bottle, but the risk of making mess with broken glass is bigger, so it's better to check them each few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One method I've used seen to good effect is to wrap the bottle in wet paper towels, and then put that in the freezer. Once the paper is frozen, the beer is quite cool, also the paper can be removed just by twisting it and it comes right off.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Well, this question might get closed as a duplicate, but I'm going to answer it anyway, and try to answer it better. IMO, the suggested duplicate answers a &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; question, only answering the hydration question too, by side-effect. Personally, I like &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; question paired with &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; answer, better than &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; question.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h3&gt;tl;dr — Alcohol is a diuretic (defined: &lt;em&gt;a substance that promotes the production of urine&lt;/em&gt;), causing you to expel more water than the body would normally expel.&lt;/h3&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That much has been shown conclusively.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;If sufficient alcohol is ingested, the diuresis occurs at the expense of all cellular components, and dehydration ensues.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=568848"&gt;Roberts, K. E. Mechanism of Dehydration Following Alcohol Ingestion. 1963. [Abstract (HTML)]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far back as the 1930s, researchers were trying to understand whether alcohol—the substance itself—is a diuretic, or indirectly induces chemicals which are diuretic (or which inhibit antidiuretics) or triggers cortical functions that cause diuresis.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;[Most] writers either state categorically or imply that alcohol per se has no diuretic action. In 1932, however, from a comparison of the diuretic effects of a given volume of water, with and without alcohol, [...] Murray concluded that alcohol itself was exerting a diuretic action. [...] The diuretic action of alcohol has now been demonstrated on five other subjects, and its mode of action investigated [...]&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://jp.physoc.org/content/101/2/172.full.pdf"&gt;Eggleton, M. G. The Diuretic Action of Alcohol in Man. 1941. [Full Paper (PDF)]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The first paper (1963) actually confirmed that &lt;strong&gt;alcohol—yes, ethanol itself—inhibits antidiuretic hormones, causing diuresis, causing dehydration.&lt;/strong&gt; (Caffeine does this too, by the way.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, yeah. That's how that happens.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Unrelated, but I found this interesting in the second paper...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;It [the diuresis] is initiated by the &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; in blood-alcohol concentration and fails to be maintained if this concentration is kept steady, even at high levels [...] The diuretic response to alcohol differs markedly in one respect from that of the cerebral cortex. The latter is most affected by the &lt;em&gt;rate&lt;/em&gt; of increase in blood-alcohol concentration: the greater this rate of increase, the greater the disturbance of function at any absolute concentration. The diuretic response, on the other hand, is dependent mainly on the &lt;em&gt;duration&lt;/em&gt; of increasing blood-alcohol concentration and not on the rate of increase (Tables 6, 7). The naturally slow absorber, therefore, tends to give a larger diuretic response than the rapid absorber.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The slower you get drunk, the more dehydrated you'll be!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hop Union has an "&lt;a href="http://www.hopunion.com/aroma-wheel/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Aroma Wheel&lt;/a&gt;" that can help with scent:  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also look at the &lt;a href="http://www.hopunion.com/hop-varieties/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Hop Variety&lt;/a&gt; page to get a little more information.&lt;br&gt;
					The thing to remember is scent doesn't always translate to taste, especially with hoppy beers such as IPA's after the beer has aged a bit. To get the taste you really need to try a beer made only with that hop (my opinion) to see what characteristics it imparts. Hop Union does have a &lt;a href="http://www.hopunion.com/hop-and-brew-school/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Hop and Brew School&lt;/a&gt; every year for both craft (professional) brewers and home brewers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can buy a small selection of a few hops and a 6 or 12 pack of bud light or coors light.  Pop the tops, toss in a few hops, re-cap and mark what hop is in each.  Wait a day or two and then taste.  This will highlight the aroma and some of the upfront flavors of the hop more than it's bitterness and will get you familiar with that hop variety.  This does require having a bottle caper and some caps, but those can be bought either at a local homebrew store or online for less than 20 dollars when you purchase the small 1oz bags of hops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you homebrew, try to brew small brew in a bag batches of 1 gallon to try different hop varieties. I don't do it too often but it's an easy 3 hour brew day and helps a lot with identifying hop profiles for bitterness, late addition, and dry hopping.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is a great question, I'm still learning but here's what I've tried:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://mikkeller.dk/2013/07/05/single-hop-ipas/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mikkeller&lt;/a&gt; single hop series &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;IPA is dead by &lt;a href="http://www.brewdog.com/blog-article/ipa-is-dead-2013" rel="nofollow"&gt;BrewDog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Arbor often do single hop beers&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your mileage may vary but if you keep your eye out, hopefully you'll find a local brewer doing this kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've also had a couple of single yeast flights which were very enlightening.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Tastings&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A couple of hops really stick in my mind because of when I had them. I remember going to a tasting of a local's brewers Galaxy IPA and he'd filled the shop with glasses of Galaxy hops and it smelled incredable.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another time was tasting a Sorachi Ace beer by Wiper and True. It was horrific, but hearing the descriptions my fellow drinkers came up with and having the brewer explaining the history of the hop really anchored it to me. It meant when I had Little Things that Kill by weird beard, I could pick it out straight away.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The other thing that I enjoy is learning where and when and why a hop has come about. European hops are so different from American which are different again from British. Not to mention New Zealand hops which have their own aromas. Obviously it's not always consistant but being able to say what kind of region a hop tastes like is a good start!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It depends... I don't see an issue with the standard Tums or Rolaids but there might be issues with ranitidine according to some studies.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/news/20000215/zantac-alcohol-dont-mix"&gt;http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/news/20000215/zantac-alcohol-dont-mix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"The effect was striking," says author Charles Lieber, MD. In a
					  three-hour test period, conducted under conditions similar to social
					  drinking, the study showed that ranitidine can increase blood alcohol
					  content by 38%. Levels reached in the study exceeded the legal
					  drinking limit -- and the effects lasted up to two hours after
					  drinking stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is in my opinion mainly thanks to low excise duty on beer in the Czech republic.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another factor is the fact that there are lower prices of almost everything in the Czech republic (I am talking mainly about local food and beverages).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And last but not least, Czech republic is I guess second or third in the whole world in beer consumption, which means there is high level of demand for traditional czech beer, which allows producers to produce beer in large quantities.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Eating will absorb some of the alcohol. Drinking on an empty stomach means the alcohol can go directly to the blood stream and the effects of the alcohol will happen faster. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So if you have food in you, especially breads, it will rather slow the process of getting drunk.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Of course you could eat four loaves of bread a slam a bottle of liquor in less then a minute and it won't help you there. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am Czech and I would say there are few factors to it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Firstly many grocery products are cheap as well as services which makes beer affordable even in restaurants. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most importantly there is long historical tradition in drinking beer. It is common to drink it with lunch, it is usual to visit the pub for a chat with friends and drink 1,2 or 10 beers there. Beer is cheaper than water in restaurants and this is another reason why people prefer it to other drinks. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is said that the government can do anything unless they increase the price of beer. The pub is often the cultural center of many villages where people meet after work and when we are there we drink beer. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your liver processes alcohol at a fixed rate (what that rate is depends on your tolerance, current liver function, what medications you are taking, and some genetics). So eating some food, particularly foods that absorb fluids like bread, will slow down the rate of alcohol absorption into your bloodstream, allowing your liver more time to metabolize the alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So for a fixed amount of alcohol, drinking on a full stomach will make you FEEL less drunk because you spread out the alcohol absorption over time so your liver has more time to metabolize it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, you can still saturate your livers ability to metabolize alcohol by ingesting high volumes of alcohol and the absorptive ability of the food in your stomach is limited (unless you vomit it out) so it is FAR from reliable technique to drink but avoid becoming intoxicated or hungover since you are still absorbing all the ingested alcohol, just over a slightly longer period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The CDC suggests no more than 2 drinks a day as moderate drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism suggests no more than 4 drinks per day, and no more than 7 drinks per week, to stay at a low risk for an alcohol use.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;At 17 your brain is still developing and imbibing alcohol runs the very real risk of affecting that development. Drink in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In response to the below comment, a single drink technically does vary but about 45ml / 1.5oz of spirit (e.g. vodka), a 5oz glass of wine, or a 12oz beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When I say it varies, different locations have different measurements. Check out this page:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Try to make a tea out of the hops.
					Put a flower or a pellet in a mug,
					Pour boiling water over it,
					Wait for 10 minutes,
					Taste,
					Make notes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Try to get hold of some samples of hops at local or regional (home)brewers.
					Most likely they will be happy to help out a fellow brewer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Water does a fair job of dissolving the aromatic compounds in hops but the resinous or oily compounds will dissolve better in ethanol. To get a really clean extract of hops, steep fresh or dry hops in vodka or neutral grain spirits, then filter and dilute with water for tasting. The straight extract can be overwhelming. A really good extract will be a milky yellow color.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, try adding the extract to an un-hopped beer to to see how the flavor changes when mixed with other ingredients. When hops are boiled in the wort during brewing, the heat can cause chemical reactions between the aromatics and other ingredients, giving the brew a slightly different flavor than the uncooked flavor of the extracts.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;We grow hops and my husband loves IPAs so he makes these hop extracts to mix with beer and cocktails.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm no expert but i'll give it a shot:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Jägermeister and other herbal liqueurs do contain herbal essences that probably have some effect on your body. But not in any medicinal quality, otherwise it couldn't be sold as food in the EU by law. There are strict rules (e.g. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_2001/83/EC" rel="nofollow"&gt;Directive 2001/83/EC&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In general the usefulness of digestifs for the digestion is heavily discussed (there are opinions that the alcohol takes away any positive effect the herbs might have). But i don't have any reliable sources at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And the alcohol is unhealthy, no doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So from a medicinal point of view: stay away from digestifs and stop eating too much so you won't need any digestion-helper.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From a recreational or culinary point of view: If you enjoy the taste, a digestif is a great closure of a good meal and the psychological effect of "believing it helps" works sometimes. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And i personally like the taste and drink it recreationally and not just as digestif ;)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_whiskey"&gt;Irish whiskey&lt;/a&gt; is one I like to do with tea. In fact I like to make an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_coffee"&gt;Irish coffee&lt;/a&gt; by substituting the coffee with a strong black tea.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Try it! I am rather fond of it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunfire_(drink)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Gunfire&lt;/a&gt; is a classic British rum and black tea cocktail, with a German equivalent in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagertee" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Jagertee&lt;/a&gt;. Two European great powers can't be wrong - go with the rum!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wild Turkey American Honey is excellent with most kinds of tea including black, green, and orange pekoe.  Throw in a squeeze of lemon for an delicious, easy to make, and modern twist on the Hot Toddy.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.americanhoney.com/age-gate.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wild Turkey American Honey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another alcohol that pairs well with tea is tea flavored vodka.  There are lots of different brands of this such as Firefly and Jeremiah Weed, and typically in bars they are paired with iced tea, they work equally well with hot tea.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finally, Fireball or other Cinnamon Whiskeys go well with Tea also, but they can often overpower less potent teas.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you like the floral taste of earl grey tea, you might enjoy adding a splash of St. Germain elderflower liqueur and a lemon twist to black tea.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The very refreshing Rosa Mae cocktail combines black tea, gin, honey and lime.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm currently sipping a hot toddy made with lemon &amp;amp; ginger herbal tea, honey, and a local whiskey.  It's very soothing on a sore throat.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would avoid alcohol in tea, its so much better in coffee! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I put any bad whisky (grouse etc) in plain old instant coffee with a bit of caster sugar and thats nice. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you want to be more adventurous then make a strong black coffee, preferably espresso and add a shot of Irish whisky, a shot of baileys (or equivalent) add one teaspoons of sugar and a little whipped cream to your taste. The result is well worth the effort! I dont personally drink caffeine so I do all this with decaf and its still amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I just shove any cheap whisky (usually grouse) into espresso coffee and add a little caster sugar - thats good! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Other combinations are espresso coffee with a shot of baileys and a shot of bourbon topped up with whipped cream and a little sugar to your taste. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The type of coffee in my experience (which is plentiful!) dosent really make much of a difference, buy mid range espresso coffee and you can create beautiful things. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I also add liqueur into coffee for people at work (barman - coffee liqueurs arent my thing) but theres plenty of people on youtube who will show you how to make the perfect coffee liqueur. Enjoy the beautiful combination that is coffee and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Generally, you'll want to avoid things with brighter, more acidic fruit flavors (apple, lemon) as those will mess with the inherent acidity of the coffee (although it should be noted that cherry is sometimes used)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Kahlua and Baileys are commonly used, as are more woodsy whiskeys. Avoid anything with carbonation, as the carbonic acid will again mess up the flavor of the coffee (beer is a no-no) and you should also avoid scotches, rye, or other peaty-earthy whiskeys.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, rum is pretty good with coffee, if you're using raw sugar in your coffee - demerara and rum are best friends.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Rumpleminze (peppermint schnapps) and coffee and cream creates a smooth and potent alcoholic drink.  Add a Godiva Chocolate Liquor for a first class-after dinner cocktail.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Grand Marnier(something like an orange flavored brandy) goes well with both black coffee and coffee and cream.  If you like your coffee black Grand Mariner adds flavor and potency without adding a lot of sweetness.  Of course it goes just as well with cream, which results in something a lot like a chocolate orange.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A Tuaca(people often describe it as tasting something like butterscotch) Macchiatto(my own recipe) is an alchololic twist on the classic coffeeshop favorite.   Mix a shot of Tuaca into a shot of steamed milk.  Top with Coffee. This tastes mild but packs a decent punch, and if you take the time to do it properly ("mark it"), it looks pretty cool. (This also tastes great with regular milk or cream.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A second variation on this, which is far less potent is to replace Tuaca with 1/2 a shot of Chambord and 1/2 a shot of Godiva White Chocolate Liqueur and mix thoroughly .  This will an tasty adult white chocolate mocha.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finally, a classic cocktail combination is coffee (with or without cream) and Sambuca.  Sambuca is often served with 3 coffee beans, but it works very well with an entire cup.  Sambuca contributes a lithe sweetness that delicately lingers in the mouth.  Avoid if you don't like Anise or Licorice.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For a seriously potent version of Sambuca and Coffee swap out Sambuca for Absinthe(not refined).  In addition to the alcohol content, Absinthe also offers a jolt akin to what caffeine provides.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Be responsible and Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I like the sweeter liqueurs like Glayva, Grand Marnier and especially Galliano with espresso. If you have a milk-based coffee, combine with a cream-based liqueur. I have never liked alcohol mixed directly in the coffee, it gives conflicting tastes. Coffee and liqueur should be sipped separately to fully enjoy each.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The short answer is probably not. Even if they thought it was original, chances are it has been done. Exceptions might include a "twist" on some mixed drink using a local product/ingredient rather than the nationally attainable and normally used ingredient. (Think local brewer's porter/stout to replace Guinness in a Black &amp;amp; Tan)  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;People can be quite creative, however. Especially if you're trying to clear some aging/less-popular liquors/beers/ingredients off your shelves and out of your inventory. Because it is Christmas, they will probably name it something Christmas-y and say "limited time only." While the same drink 3 months later might have a St Patrick's Day (in the US) theme.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Do bartenders try to do this?  Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Do they advertise it as such?  Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Is it truly original - as in nobody, anywhere, anytime, has ever made that drink before?  Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I used to run a bar, and my bartenders would experiment with these things for various holidays and special events.  Customers want to feel special - they know you're not making the alcoholic equivalent of the Mona Lisa, but having a special drink at your local bar is fun and appealing to them.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Once you get beyond the standard cocktails, bartenders (and bars) try to distinguish themselves with variations and twists (pun intended) to stand out in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Combine 1 part each of cinnamon-flavored (some rum) and mint-flavored (some vodka) with 2 parts of (some cream liqueur), shake well with ice, serve it in a martini glass that's been rimmed with (some flavored sugar), stick a candy-cane in it, and dust with (some spice).  Call it an "Old Saint Nick" or a "Naughty Rudolph".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Is the Old Saint Nick in XYZ Bar in Birmingham, Alabama, USA the same as the Old Saint Nick in ABC Pub in Birmingham, England?  Probably not.  Does anyone care?  No.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To &lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/adulterate"&gt;adulterate&lt;/a&gt; means to dilute or debase a substance. So adulterated schnapps means schnapps with &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; added in. Much like cocaine cut with flour, that &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; need not be a similar substance, but is likely to be something cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It gets worse when this adulteration is "off the books", because it means that a company can pass one product with the relevant consumer authority, then turn around and add whatever they want into it. That stuff might end up poisonous.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it's rightly considered a crime:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The word is ADULTERATE. Which means to change, alter or transform in some way. This is not so much a problem in the USA, but many countries unscrupulous alcohol sellers will "cut" the ethanol with methanol or water instead. Methanol, while an alcohol, is poisonous to humans (well, I guess ethanol is too in high enough quantities). A quick search found that this is a big problem in India and Russia. The other most common way is to dilute the drink with water. The benefit of doing is this is using something that is cheaper to produce than ethanol and and stretch out your supply of legitimate alcohol and make more money.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The answer is no; drinking traditionally prepared absinthe causes no more brain-damge or insanity than any other alcoholic beverage...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;...absinthe languished in exile for nearly a century, a casualty of bad publicity, special-interest lobbies and mythology. That allowed absinthe to become something of an urban legend, something to talk about in whispers, with wide eyes. Much is said about absinthe; very little of that is true.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;So let’s clear up a few misconceptions. Absinthe does not make you hallucinate. It is not wildly addictive. It will not cause you to lop off your ear, unless (possibly, on the off-chance) you are a deeply disturbed painter racked by poverty, heartbreak and mental illness. Rather, absinthe is a good drink.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Degas’ famous 1876 painting, L’Absinthe, is a portrait of overindulgence and isolation: a woman slumped over her cafe table in front of an absinthe glass, face gone slack. In 1890, the book “Wormwood: A Drama of Paris” vilified absinthe, portraying the downward spiral that inevitably follows a drink. (Think “Reefer Madness” for fin-de-siècle Paris.) In 1905, a disturbed Swiss man, drunk on absinthe, murdered his entire family. Absinthe didn’t make him do it — any more than a bipolar who hacks up his neighbor after drinking Jamesons has been deranged by Irish whiskey.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Environmental chemist T.A. Breaux, who has studied absinthe for 14 years, explains what led to the drink’s decline. “As absinthe became immensely popular, there was a drive to make it cheaper,” he says. “In urban areas, where they didn’t have a lot of space for distillation equipment, people made absinthes from cheap industrial alcohol, using chemicals that would induce the green color. There were people who had an interest in capitalizing on this, and they failed to make a distinction between these cheaper drinks and real absinthe. It’s a little bit like using Mad Dog as a reason to ban Bordeaux.” &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/2007/12/21/absinthe/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;http://www.salon.com/2007/12/21/absinthe/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/A_FQ_glhMxw" rel="noreferrer"&gt;https://youtu.be/A_FQ_glhMxw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;According to the wiki that you linked:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The earliest reference to Epiphany as a Christian feast was in A.D. 361, by Ammianus Marcellinus.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, it would be pertinent to drink wines made from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_wine#Italian_grape_varieties" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Italian grapes&lt;/a&gt; since the feast was held within the time of the Roman Empire.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;More particularly, you might pick a grape variety from &lt;a href="http://www.unrv.com/economy/wine-chart.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;a list of ancient grapes&lt;/a&gt; from which the Romans, themselves, would have made wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not that it's entirely pertinent to the Feast of Epiphany, but it is apt to say here that, you might purchase your wine here: &lt;a href="https://www.epiphanywineco.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.epiphanywineco.com/&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as my quick and limited research has gone, there really isn't an 'official' wine of the feast - not really a Christian concept to have "official alcoholic beverages," imho.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as local traditions, the wiki you linked covers the traditions of the feast internationally but again, alcohol consumption doesn't really ever seem to be the focus...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, let's not forget that the Roman's would have had beer at this feast...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Now there is the Newfoundland thing. You know &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibb&amp;#39;s_Eve" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Tibb's Eve&lt;/a&gt; (sometime called St Tibb's Eve) which occurs in Newfoundland and Labrador every December 23, on the eve of Christmas Eve.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Tibb’s Eve. Tipp’s Eve. Tip’s Eve. Even Tipsy Eve. It doesn’t matter what you call it – it’s December 23rd in Newfoundland and it’s time to have a drink.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Every year on the eve of Christmas Eve people in Newfoundland get the party started. Family and friends are home from the mainland and that calls for a tipple or two. Downtown is on wheels and it’s usually a good time to catch a show. All the best bands have gigs on the go. But how did this yearly party night begin?&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;In the lead up to the holidays, Advent is a sober, religious time of year. It’s all about prepping and waiting for the celebration. Denying yourself so that you can really give’r when the big day arrives. By the time Christmas actually rolls around, the good people of Newfoundland are jonesing for a drink. It used to be that they would wait until Christmas Day to imbibe but sometime in the mid-20th century people had had enough and made up the holiday of Tibb’s Eve as an excuse to crack open the bottle two days early.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Why Tibb’s Eve?&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Why Tibb? The word is archaic slang for a promiscuous woman. Tibb was often used as the name of a loose-moraled woman in 17th century English plays – she was often the comic relief. Adults could refer to Saint Tibb, knowing it would go over the heads of kids, who thought she was a real saint. &lt;a href="http://www.suitcaseandheels.com/tibbs-eve-a-newfoundland-thing/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Tibb’s Eve: A Newfoundland Thing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is an other interesting article on Tibb's Eve: &lt;a href="http://www.southerngazette.ca/news/2010/7/8/the-origins-of-tibb-s-eve-1521238.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The origins of Tibb's Eve&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Merry Christmas everyone!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;No, that's may be true if you prepare absinthe the wrong way, because it has Tujone. Absinthe may be dangerous if badly prepared, however today's laws are really strict (in UE at least) and you won't find "home-made" (that may be dangerous) absinthe sold anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally I drink it sometimes with friends and we have never had problems (except, you know, we got a little bit drunk..)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Please note that it is not raccomanded to drink it if you are not used to alcohol because it generally have 60% to 80% vol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Drink-Absinthe" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; for some information.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another possible answer for this question could be &lt;strong&gt;Drunkard's Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is celebrated on the Thursday before &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_Wednesday" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Ash Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; by Syrian Catholics.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Syrian Catholics have celebrated the day as "Drunkard's Thursday" with dolmas as the traditional food. - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_Thursday" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Fat Thursday&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In The Netherlands we have Kingsday. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;King’s Day may well be the best party in Holland. On 27 April, we celebrate King Willem Alexander’s birthday with music, street parties, flea markets, and fun fairs. The king himself travels through the country with his family. On the night before King’s Day, King’s Night is celebrated with music shows in The Hague and other cities and the nation’s biggest flea (‘free’) market in Utrecht.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Every city has it's own big parties and fleamarkets. Here in Groningen, king's night is very popular and probably one of the busiest nights in the bars.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So... the short answer is novelty... and possibly, less beer loss per firkin if the CO2 is causing the beer to be head-y and a lot of beer gets wasted when bartenders pour through the foam.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The more complex answer is - as long as a beer is in a metal firkin... there should be no discerning difference in quality/taste/etc. The difference would come in the form of wooden firkins. If, for example, you had a Stout on tap and the same stout served in a wooden firkin, the longer the beer stayed in the wooden firkin, the more the flavors would change. Especially if the wooden firkin was previously used to make a spirit (like bourbon).  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the latter - bourbon barrrel - the longer the beer stays in, the more of the bourbon flavor shines through.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Prohibition was an Era in American history from 1920-1933 - and - it failed miserably. If anything, it made alcohol more popular.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Prohibition, in general, also means to prohibit something via law or religion though. The religious aspect is the only case that one can see prohibition working. ::Insert Mormonism/Islamic religion/et cetera here::&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes the same beer from a cask and a keg will be VERY different.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To your first point, breweries and bars will often have specially treated casks in ways that are impossible to do with kegs.  Stuff like dry-hopping the beer in the cask at the bar so it's at its freshest and most intense.  With a keg you'd need to put this between the tap and the glass like a Randall but with a cask you can just pop the cap and shove whatever you want in there.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Casked beer also generally still have active yeast in it, at least according to CAMRA's rules, while kegs are filtered and have no yeast in them.  Because of this there's a lot of preparation involved in a proper real ale cask.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cask will come sealed from the brewery.  First a soft spile or peg must be driven into the top hole.  This is just a porous plug that allows air out.  Based on how foamy this gets the bar can see how active the yeast is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the yeast dies down the soft spile gets replaced with a hard spile which stops gas exchange.  The cask then has to sit for a while so all the yeast can fall to the bottom as well as any other particulates or large proteins in the beer.  This is called "Dropping Bright"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, once the beer has dropped bright the cask can be tapped which involves removing the hard spile and also either hooking up the side hole to a beer engine or a simple tap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Because of all this and traditionally being served from a cellar or bartop at "cellar temperature" vs kegs which are refrigerated the beer that comes out will be slightly warmer (40-50F vs 30-40F), much slower because of the pumping and off-gassing from the pour, and way less carbonated.  Some beer engines will also use "sparkler" taps that fizz up the beer even more on the way out to generate more head but also results in a less carbonated beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The result is a beer that will generally be smoother and rounder, you may get more flavor and more sweetness since it's warmer.  Some flavors will come out more in the warmer and less carbonated and some will be overshadowed.  Mouthfeel will be affected a lot by both factors as well.  It's a hugely different animal and sometimes people like it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I don't think the Irish really care too much as long as they have a drink in front of them. How about Irish Whiskey and Guinness? Maybe some Irish Coffee, Bailey's or cider. All the Irish I know aren't too picky. I don't think you find too much green beer in Ireland, that's a made up American thing. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Apparently alcohol is not unhealthy if you limit yourself to a drink a day.  Life expectancy increases with moderate alcohol consumption however if you go far beyond that life expectancy decreases.&lt;br&gt;
					I rarely have more than two  to three drinks a month however in light of this information I'm thinking of increasing my consumption.  
					Whether the 50-plus Herbs in Jagermeister make it healthier or not I think it's a good place to start.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Because beer is 95% water! Yes alcohol is a diuretic but if delivered with all this water, it is actually hydrating. If you would drink these huge glasses full of water you would urinate fearsomely as well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So the best news ever is: beer is hydrating. There is scientific evidence for it &lt;a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-many-glasses-of-water-should-we-drink-a-day/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; from 4:14 onwards. All before that is about the benefits of drinking water, yeah yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Winemakers can make either a dry wine or sweet wine. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the winemakers want to make a sweet wine, they must artificially halt the fermentation process by either increasing or decreasing the temperature in the fermentation tank to a certain level in which the yeasts cannot survive. Manipulating the temperature kills the yeast (well, actually they lay dormant) and it allows natural sugar to be left in the wine. The high sugar concentration of the grape plays a role, too. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is a second way to artificially halt the fermentation process, it is called fortification. Winemakers will add alcohol during the fermentation process to a level in which the yeasts cannot survive, also leaving natural sugar in the wine. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And by the way, Moscato is purposefully made in a sweet style which is why it is always sweet. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Moscato is a sparkling white wine made in the Piedmont region of Italy. It is made with Muscat (Moscato) grapes. They are fermented naturally until they hit 5.5% ABV and then the wine is run through a sterile filter to preserve the sweetness and stop fermentation. It's then artificially carbonated and put in a bottle. It's meant to be an dessert wine because of this sweetness. Also known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscato_d%27Asti" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Moscato d'Asti&lt;/a&gt; and there is a similar wine made nearby simply called Asti. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Consumption of beer in the Czech Republic has been the highest in the world for many years. Bavarians claim that it is the highest in Bavaria, but they are not an independent country. Anyway, if we talked about historical lands then consumption of beer in Bohemia (Czechia's "mainland") would be higher than Bavaria.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Adding yet another possibility for everyone, but this time I would like to make the national drinking day an international drinking day: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Beer_Day" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;International Beer Day&lt;/a&gt; (IBD).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;International Beer Day (IBD) is a celebration on the &lt;strong&gt;first Friday of every August&lt;/strong&gt; founded in 2007 in Santa Cruz, California. Since its inception, International Beer Day has grown from a small localized event in the western United States into a worldwide celebration spanning 207 cities, 50 countries and 6 continents. Specifically, International Beer Day has three declared purposes:&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;1.To gather with friends and enjoy the taste of beer.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;2.To celebrate those responsible for brewing and serving beer.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;3.To unite the world under the banner of beer, by celebrating the beers of all nations together on a single day.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Popularity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;International Beer Day began as a celebration at the founders’ local bar, but has since expanded to become a worldwide event. Celebrations are planned throughout the United States as well as in Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, England, France, Greece, Honduras, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Romania, Scotland, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Thailand, the Philippines, Turkey, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, Uruguay, Vanuatu, and Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As with almost anything that becomes banned or illegal it causes the substance to increase in cost greatly since the acquisition of the substance requires illegal acts from manufacturing to distribution. Therefore, no prohibition does not generally work in stopping consumption but it does result in many other legal issues.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is the usual great stuff relating to 'Toasting'. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toast_(honor)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;From wikipedia - which is normally correct.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I then had a quick look at snopes.com, they proclaim the following to be false:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Q: Why do people clink their glasses before drinking a toast?
					  A: It used to be common for someone to try to kill an enemy by offering him a poisoned drink. To prove to a guest that a drink was safe, it became customary for a guest to pour a small amount of his drink into the glass of the host. Both men would drink it simultaneously. When a guest trusted his host, he would then just touch or clink the host’s glass with his own.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;ORIGINS:   Many explanations have been advanced to explain our custom of clinking glasses when participating in toasts. One is that early Europeans felt the sound helped to drive off evil spirits. Another holds that by clanking the glasses into one another, wine could be sloshed from glass to glass, thereby serving as a&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wine glasses&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;proof the beverages had not been poisoned. Yet another claim asserts that the “clink” served as a
					symbolic acknowledgment of trust among imbibers who did not feel the need to sample each others’ drinks to prove them unadulterated.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Each of those explanations is false. While making a racket for the purpose of scaring off evil spirits underpins other customs that carry over to this day (e.g., the tolling of church bells at weddings, and the loud shouts and noisemaking at the stroke of twelve on New Year’s Eve), the “clink” is a relatively new aspect of toasting and, as such, came along well after folks had relinquished the notion that demons both lurked in every corner of typical day-to-day existence and could be sped on their way by a bit of noise. As for sloshing wine from one glass to another, drinking vessels would need to be filled to the brim to effect that, and if they were, such practice would waste valuable potables (because some would be sure to land on the floor) and likely douse the toasters too. And while the poisoning of enemies has long been part of the ordinary mayhem of the world, the practice of touching of one’s filled glass to those of others when participating in a toast is unrelated to suspicion of the wine’s having been tampered with; such killings were not so common at any nebulous point in the past that a signal to one’s host indicating he was clear of suspicion of attempted murder needed to be enshrined in the canon of social gestures.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To get at the real reason for the clink of glass on glass, we have to first look at why and how we toast, and where the practice originated.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The custom of sealing with booze expressions of good wishes for the health of others dates back so far that its origins are now lost to us, yet in numerous cultures&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;such acts of camaraderie often involved shared drinking vessels. The clinking of individual cups or glasses as a proof of trust wouldn’t have meant much when
					everyone drank from the same bowl. Indeed, in those cultures where shared drinking containers was the norm, to produce one’s own vessel in such company was to communicate an unmistakable message of hostility and distrust; it would have been regarded as akin to bringing along a food taster to sample the repast.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;“Toasting,” our term for the pronouncement of benedictions followed by a swallowing of alcohol, is believed to have taken its name from a practice involving a shared drinking vessel. Floated in the “loving cup” passed among celebrants in Britain was a piece of (spiced) cooked bread that the host would consume along with the last few drops of liquid after the cup had made one round of the company. In modern times toasting has become a matter of imbibing from individual drinking vessels rather than from one shared flagon, so to compensate for the sense of unity lost in doing away with the sharing of the same cup we have evolved the practice of simultaneously drinking each from our own glass when a toast is made, thereby maintaining a communal connection to the kind words being spoken.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The clinking of glasses has been added to the practice of offering toasts for a few reasons, none having anything to do with poison. Prior to such augmentation, toasts pleased only four of the five senses; by adding the “clink,” a pleasant sound was made part of the experience, and wine glasses have come to be prized not only for their appearance but also for the tones they produce when struck. Yet beyond mere aural pleasure, the act of touching your glass to that of others is a way of emphasizing that you are part of the good wishes being expressed, that you are making a physical connection to the toast. The practice also serves another purpose, that of uniting the individuals taking part in the benediction into a cohesive group: as the wine glasses are brought together, so symbolically are the people holding them. On a deeper level, the wine is also being recommuned with itself — that which had been one (when it had been in its own bottle) but was separated (when it was poured into a variety of glasses) is brought back into contact with the whole of itself, if only for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Etiquette mavens say one need not clink glasses with everyone present when participating in toasts among large assemblies. Rather than reach across vast expanses of wide tables (thereby risking losing your balance and ending up in the guacamole), simply raise your glass and make eye contact with the group.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;MY OWN THOUGHTS ON THE SUBJECT&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, with all this in mind, my own thought is that in times gone by as 'rivals' drank each others health, they would drink from the other person's cup (to avoid poisoning - however all one would have to do would be to poison one's own cup - surely that would have worked?!), as the cups were held to the other person's lips they would inadvertantly 'clink' together.  As time moved on and we attempted not to kill everyone in our paths the clinking just wort of became symbolic.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt; In Gujarat , A state of India There is prohibition since 1958 which has never worked and also created lots of illegal troubles as well as loss of taxes on booze. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Bombay State had prohibition between 1948 and 1950, and again from 1958.[17] Gujarat has a sumptuary law in force that proscribes the manufacture, storage, sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages. The legislation has been in force since 1 May 1960 when Bombay State was bifurcated into the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat. The Bombay Prohibition Act, 1949 is still in force in Gujarat state, however there is licensing regime in Maharashtra with granting licenses to vendors and traders. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Gujarat is the only Indian state with a death penalty for the manufacture and sale of homemade liquor that results in fatalities. The legislation is titled the Bombay Prohibition (Gujarat Amendment) Bill, 2009.[18] The legislation was prompted by numerous deaths resulting from the consumption of methyl alcohol.[19]&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But the result is that people dies due to homemade liqueurs every month and every year. You can check this. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;in a world where people follow laws and do not attempt to profit from illegal activities, Prohibition of a product would 'in theory' work.  however, that is not the reality we live in.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Historical evidence shows us that with a vast majority of prohibition of a product, the demand for said product does not immediately drop, but the supply does.   This makes the product very profitable for those entities that are able to obtain said product and then distribute it for basically any price they so choose.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Thus for the example with alcohol prohibition in the 1920's US, crime families immediately started to acquire or make product, distribute it, and even open facilities to sell and consume.  This took out all middle men and gave them full and complete control of the entire supply chain, and thus allowed for them to keep maximum profits.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another example in the US, is how the war on drugs has done little to stop the demand for drug in the country and only made the cartels more money.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Tea and beer can be a great combination. I have a blog post &lt;a href="https://teawithgary.com/2014/11/25/tea-and-beer/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; about some tea beers that I made in cooperation with a local brewery. The combination of cinnamon orange spice tea with a hefeweizen worked especially well, as hefes are often served with a slice of citrus.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I took a class a few years back on pairing tea with whiskey (or whisky). They were focused on serving the whiskey and tea separately rather than blending them, but blending can work nicely. I'm a fan of smokey malty Scotch — mostly the Islays — and it blends nicely with a powerful black tea. If you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; dig the smoke flavor, blend an Islay Scotch with a lapsang souchong or Russian Caravan tea.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you like citrus flavors in your tea, try using a splash of Triple Sec or Cointreau.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In Northern Germany they handle it in the following way. First they take rock candy and put it into a glass. It can be brown or white rock candy. The glass is filled up with brown rum which has a Vol% between 38 and 40 of alcohol. It is possible to mix and use it immediately, but most people just put it aside for a while. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;After some time the fluid of rum becomes glutinous and the surface of the rock candy becomes soft. When this mixture is in that status they put some spoons of it into the cup and fill it up with black tea. Could be from Ceylon or comparable. When filling up with the hot tea the rock candy crashes internally and when mixing up the tea with it all it becomes a wonderful experience especially in wintertime.&lt;/p&gt;
