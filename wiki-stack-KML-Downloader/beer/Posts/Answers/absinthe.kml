					&lt;p&gt;I'll take a stab at this... Absinthe is an unregulated name unlike something like Champagne which is highly regulated name/place. With Champagne you can only use Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay in making it and it has to be grown in the Champagne region. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Absinthe can be made by any distiller anywhere in the world. What that means is that you could put whatever you want into a bottle and call it Absinthe (within liquor regulations). True that traditional Absinthe is a green color, from wormwood, but using other herbs or plants could change it a different color. But a quick look around the web yielded several wildly colored examples called Absinthe. So, if it bugs you, only drink green Absinthe and ignore the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Clear Absinthe&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Absinthe is made much in the same way that many gins are.  You take neutral spirits, add botanicals (wormwood and anise), and re-distill.  Anything that comes out of the still will be clear.  Some absinthes at this point are finished, these will be called blanche (white) or sometime la bleue.  The first absinthe available in Val-de-Travers (the birthplace of absinthe) after the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/04/world/europe/rebirth-of-the-potion-that-made-valdetravers-famous.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;ban in Switzerland was lifted&lt;/a&gt; was a blanche.  That same bottling was the driving force behind making it legal in the United States &lt;a href="http://www.bevlaw.com/absintheinamerica/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;(interview of lawyer who fought the ban)&lt;/a&gt;.  It can be really good stuff.  Any of these can be really easily colored.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Green Absinthe&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Usually absinthe gets a second chance to mingle (macerate) with some herbs after it's sprung from the still, this style is known at verte.  This is when it gets it's color, as well as some extra flavor and aroma. It's a more complex flavor.  The color that the chlorophyll imparts is dull.  If it's neon green there was &lt;a href="http://realabsinthe.blogspot.com/2011/06/what-makes-green-fairy-green.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;food coloring added&lt;/a&gt; and some of these "greener" varieties are actually blanche at heart.  Also of note is that sometimes these food colored types add sugar, to make it friendlier to less experienced drinkers (or to hide poor distillation technique as happens with vodka).  There is at least &lt;a href="https://www.absinthes.com/absinthe-adnams-rouge-p935" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;one non-green bottling&lt;/a&gt; that I know of that is still macerated post distillation, but uses hibiscus which turns it red.  These methods of coloration don't make them any less of a true absinthe, they do use wormwood (and equally important, anise).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Czech Absinth (without the e)&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The most common non-green "absinthe" is so called Czech-style, also known as Bohemian style.  These are &lt;a href="http://wormwoodsociety.org/index.php/general-information-education-214/39-whats-wrong-with-bohemian-qstyleq-absinth" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;not rightly called absinthe&lt;/a&gt; and are historically known for very low quality.  Instead of distilling the botanicals in the alcohol, they are cold compounded.  It's made either by mixing spirits, flavoring oils, and food coloring or by macerating the botanicals without distillation.  Be wary of absinthes &lt;a href="https://www.diffordsguide.com/encyclopedia/275/bws/absinthe-how-is-absinthe-made" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;much over 140 proof&lt;/a&gt;, as they are frequently Czech-style.  Do be aware that they're called Czech-style because that's where the style originated and where most of this variety still comes from, however the Czech Republic does have &lt;a href="http://www.praguepost.com/articles/2006/04/26/worthy-of-their-name.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;good examples of absinthe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The answer is no; drinking traditionally prepared absinthe causes no more brain-damge or insanity than any other alcoholic beverage...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;...absinthe languished in exile for nearly a century, a casualty of bad publicity, special-interest lobbies and mythology. That allowed absinthe to become something of an urban legend, something to talk about in whispers, with wide eyes. Much is said about absinthe; very little of that is true.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;So let’s clear up a few misconceptions. Absinthe does not make you hallucinate. It is not wildly addictive. It will not cause you to lop off your ear, unless (possibly, on the off-chance) you are a deeply disturbed painter racked by poverty, heartbreak and mental illness. Rather, absinthe is a good drink.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Degas’ famous 1876 painting, L’Absinthe, is a portrait of overindulgence and isolation: a woman slumped over her cafe table in front of an absinthe glass, face gone slack. In 1890, the book “Wormwood: A Drama of Paris” vilified absinthe, portraying the downward spiral that inevitably follows a drink. (Think “Reefer Madness” for fin-de-siècle Paris.) In 1905, a disturbed Swiss man, drunk on absinthe, murdered his entire family. Absinthe didn’t make him do it — any more than a bipolar who hacks up his neighbor after drinking Jamesons has been deranged by Irish whiskey.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Environmental chemist T.A. Breaux, who has studied absinthe for 14 years, explains what led to the drink’s decline. “As absinthe became immensely popular, there was a drive to make it cheaper,” he says. “In urban areas, where they didn’t have a lot of space for distillation equipment, people made absinthes from cheap industrial alcohol, using chemicals that would induce the green color. There were people who had an interest in capitalizing on this, and they failed to make a distinction between these cheaper drinks and real absinthe. It’s a little bit like using Mad Dog as a reason to ban Bordeaux.” &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/2007/12/21/absinthe/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;http://www.salon.com/2007/12/21/absinthe/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;No, that's may be true if you prepare absinthe the wrong way, because it has Tujone. Absinthe may be dangerous if badly prepared, however today's laws are really strict (in UE at least) and you won't find "home-made" (that may be dangerous) absinthe sold anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally I drink it sometimes with friends and we have never had problems (except, you know, we got a little bit drunk..)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Please note that it is not raccomanded to drink it if you are not used to alcohol because it generally have 60% to 80% vol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Drink-Absinthe" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; for some information.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am going to put my two bits into this question also.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are several existing colored absinthe on the market at the moment and a couple of ways to get various colored varieties. Artificial coloring is the most common.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Absinthe may be found in the following colors: &lt;strong&gt;Green, Red (or Rose), Yellow, Brown, Clear and Blue.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One way to get the desired colored is to make your own absinthe as can be seen in the following recipe. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Put the dry herbs in a large jar. Dampen slightly. Add 800 milliliters of 85-95 percent alcohol. Wine spirits make a better product than pure grain alcohol. Let steep for several days - a week is better - shaking occasion absinthe. Then add 600 milliliters of water and let the whole macerate for another day. Decant off the liquid squeezing as much from the mass of herb as possible. Wet the herbs with some vodka and squeeze again. Recipe should give a little over a liter and a half of green liquor. It must then be distilled... - &lt;a href="http://absinthe.msjekyll.com/recipe.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Traditional absinthe recipe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There or other non-traditional herbs and artificial coloring agents that are used to make a particular color also.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Absinthe can be classified differently&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;By color:&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Green absinthe – classically natural color of absinthe. Color can vary from deep emerald to light green or olive shade. Practically every manufacturer produces green absinthe. &lt;strong&gt;But because the natural dye (chlorophyll from the leaves) is not durable therefore manufacturers in most cases use artificial coloring.&lt;/strong&gt; To preserve natural green color of absinthe it is bottle in green or brown bottles. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Yellow absinthe – is usually natural colored because natural dye from chlorophyll has a tendency to lose its color and become more yellowish in couple of months after production (aging of absinthe). &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Red absinthe – is colored by extract of pomegranate or macerated with blossoms of hibiscus what gives absinthe light-ruby shade and original after-taste. But nowadays majority of red absinthes are artificially colored. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Brown absinthe – unlike all the other absinthes this kind is macerated with the roots of wormwood not the leaves of blossoms. Also dark color can be achieved by adding black cutch extract which brings slight flavour of berries. - &lt;a href="http://absinthe-time.eu/EN/menu/kinds-of-absinthe" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Kinds of Absinthe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia has this to say about absinthe:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Absinthe may also be naturally coloured pink or red using rose or hibiscus flowers. This was referred to as a &lt;strong&gt;rose&lt;/strong&gt; (pink) or &lt;strong&gt;rouge&lt;/strong&gt; (red) absinthe. Only one historical brand of rose absinthe has been documented.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Many contemporary absinthe critics simply classify absinthe as distilled or mixed, according to its production method. And while the former is generally considered far superior in quality to the latter, an absinthe's simple claim of being 'distilled' makes no guarantee as to the quality of its base ingredients or the skill of its maker.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blanche&lt;/strong&gt;, or la Bleue: Blanche absinthe (also referred to as la Bleue in Switzerland) is bottled directly following distillation and reduction, and is uncoloured (clear). The name la Bleue was originally a term used for bootleg Swiss absinthe, but has become a popular term for post-ban-style Swiss absinthe in general.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As noted in &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/a/6410/5064"&gt;Montijello's excellent answer&lt;/a&gt;, clear absinthe may be easily artificially colored.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of Clear Absinthes on the market as can be seen on the following website:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.absinthes.com/en/clear-absinthe-s328" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Clear Absinthe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;This is usually the favourite of people trying absinthe for the first time, and of the most experience absintheurs: where absinthe drinkers settle again in the end, having explored the world of green absinthe. Quite simply because it is balanced and delicious. Much of the finest absinthe is clear. Also known as Blanche, La Bleue, and white absinthe...&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;
