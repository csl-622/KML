					&lt;p&gt;The malt is providing the sweetness and the hops are providing the bitterness plus the lingering flavour.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Depending on what type malted grains the beer is brewed will effect its sweetness. This is due to how much fermentatble sugar can be extracted from the grains, any non-fermentable sugars will stay in the beer and provide effect how the beer sweetness. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hops are used in different stages of the brewing process to provide different functions.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hops are added at the intial point of the boiling process (which is usually about 60mins) - The hops oils released from the hops at this stage provide the beer with head retention, bitterness and also natural perservative. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hops are then again added during the final stage of the boiling process (last 10-15mins) - At this point the hops are providing the lingering taste that you are noting, plus any aroma notes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This discussion would be more suitable in the homebrew stack as Andrew said, but I will answer it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You are on the right track, making a simple pilsner recipe will show you the effects of the malt, yeast, water and hops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is a technique called SMASH (single malt, single hops), which is widely used to "test" the effect of a new ingredient. It is pretty much exactly what you are doing. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The best technique: brew as often as possible. Be critical of your beer. Get a BJCP judge (or similar) to try your beer and give you feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Relax, dont worry, have a homebrew. (Papasian).&lt;/p&gt;
