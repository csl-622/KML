					&lt;p&gt;The term "imperial" generally means "strong", as in having a higher ABV.  You may also find "Imperial IPAs" (aka IIPAs, or sometimes Double or Triple IPAs), and again, they are boosting the alcohol content.  The actual ingredients (hops, or oatmeal, as per your example) do not come into play, except to balance the flavors against the malt.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The first Imperial Stout was made by Thrale's Brewery to export to the Russian royalty, it had high alcoholic content so that it could survive the trip gracefully &lt;a href="http://www.wellsandyoungs.co.uk/home/news/courage-imperial-russian-stout" rel="nofollow"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. Since then Imperial has been used as a prefix to signify beers which are of higher alcohol volume than their normal variants, and luckily they're no longer just for Russian royalty.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, yes, this is quite typical.  Snifters are widely used for beer and generally for two reasons, in my experience.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;As you suspect, the bowl shaped glass helps to concentrate the aroma.  However, this isn't unique to the snifter as many types of beer glasses incorporate a narrowing throat to provide this effect. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Quantity.  With a glass of beer that has a particularly high alcohol content, or particularly strong flavor, you'll often get much less than a standard 12-16 oz. pour.  The beer you refer to for instance, the Big Bad Baptist, has an alcohol content of 11.8% ABV, which closer to wine than beer, (and wine has a standard 5oz serving size per glass, or thereabouts) so it calls for a smaller serving size.  However, a 5oz or 6oz serving would look rather silly in a pint glass, so a snifter is more appropriate in proportion. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as I know it is only sold on dark Lord day at the brewery and you need to buy tickets.  I've only had it once from someone who went.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/news/ct-ptb-dark-lord-day-st-0327-20150328-story.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Three Floyds Brewing cuts off packaged sales on Dark Lord Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is no "right" price. It's whatever the market will demand. If you can find the price that bottles are selling on the open market, then that's the price people are willing to pay. Too bad there's no eBay for beer and wine!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The only way to know the price for sure is to sell it and find out the price at that time, preferably at auction.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The only way to price a rare item like this &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; selling it is to mark it to market. You need to find a number of comparable bottles of special edition beers with similar collectors' markets and use the prices of those bottles to calculate the current price of that bottle. The more similar the comparable bottles are in terms of time since sale, qualities of the beer (style, ABV etc.), number of bottles produced and size of "following" or number of collectors, the closer your price will be to a realistic price. If it were really valuable an auction house such as Sotheby's or Christie's could be employed to do the calculations for you as they are quite involved. Note that marking to market only gives a guideline price at a moment in time as prices can fluctuate wildly in collectables markets. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The basis of this pricing model is the pricing of any liquid commodity or financial instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
