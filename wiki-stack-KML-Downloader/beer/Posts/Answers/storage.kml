					&lt;p&gt;There are some rules of thumb.  First, if it's a hop-oriented beer (pales, IPAs), drink sooner than later, as the hop aromas and flavor will fade over time.  Second, the higher the alcohol by volume (ABV, think imperial stouts), the better chance it has of lasting longer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, it may be best to ask the brewer what the recommended shelf life is for any &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As you might expect, cans can impart a metallic flavor on some beer, but on the flip-side, they are much less prone to skunking. So if you're looking to store the beer for a while in a cool, dark place, I'd say bottle. However, if you plan on keeping it in a light place or outdoors, a can is probably your best bet.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Temperature does not skunk beer, contrary to popular belief. It is much more important to keep it out of the light. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In general, you just want to store your beer bottles standing upright. For tons of detail on bottle storage, &lt;a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/101/store/"&gt;BeerAdvocate has a great guide&lt;/a&gt;, but in short: storing a standard shaped beer bottle upright minimizes the surface area exposed to air in the bottle, slowing oxidation, and preventing spoilage. Additionally, in the case of unfiltered or bottle conditioned beers, it's highly desirable that any yeast settle at the &lt;em&gt;bottom&lt;/em&gt; of the bottle - and not anywhere else. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've looked into this quite a bit; I was thinking of building a beer rack as a winter project. However, All my research tells me that beer should always be stored upright, no matter what variety, unlike wine which is best stored on its side. &lt;a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/101/store/"&gt;Beer advocate has an interesting article on the subject.&lt;/a&gt; For corked bottles, one does not want to impart any off-flavors from the waxes and other chemicals on the cork. For proper aging, it is also best that the yeast be allowed to settle on the bottom of the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A modern canned beer should never taste like metal. If it does, you're probably drinking straight from the can, and while the folks at &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/amgfgU5-lhs" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Alchemist might recommend that&lt;/a&gt;, I can't say I share their view.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Modern beer cans are lined with a water-based chemical that essentially ensures that your beer &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; touches metal. This in turn means that strictly speaking, canned beers will keep longer without being &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/50/will-temperature-changes-cause-a-beer-to-skunk?rq=1"&gt;skunked&lt;/a&gt;, and pressurized packing means there's less air in a can then a bottle, which adds further preservative benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, very few beers that are good enough for this decision to matter are offered in a &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt; of containers - most small breweries just don't have the capacity to both can and bottle - especially of the sort of small-batch stuff that you'd actually be interested in trying to cellar and age. Furthermore, there are significant environmental and economic arguments in favor of both bottles and cans.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, choose the packaging that's more convenient for you to store, consume from, and recycle when you're done. The quality difference is essentially insignificant. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I use 3 methods to store the beer, and others, while camping:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Cooler: The way you mentioned in your question.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Sunk in water: If possible, put the beer either in a plastic bag or in a hole in a nearby water body, creek or river.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;In the ground: Dig a hole in the ground in a shady area and store it in there.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Second and third possibilities will keep it cool, but not really cold, depending on the area. The you can cool it even more by placing it in ice shortly before consuming it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Slight temperature changes will &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; spoil your beer. Large temperature changes will.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The "skunky" beer is actually lightstruck. This is exactly what it says: the beer has been damaged by light, such as sunlight or florescent light. When UV lights penetrate the glass of a beer bottle, they mess with the chemical makeup of some acids produced by the hops. The result is a new compound called methyl mercaptan, which is one of the components of the defense mechanisms found in the skunk.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is prevented by packaging beer in brown bottles, which is better protected from UV rays. Unfortunately, this lets those green rays get in, which makes sense as to why some beers are served with lime: it keeps away the "skunky" smell for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In reality, it doesn't take much to spoil your beer. If your beer in a green or clear bottle has not already been spoiled before it got to the store, about a minute's worth of exposure to the sun would do it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;In short, no.&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://www.professorbeer.com/articles/skunked_beer.html"&gt;explained by George de Piro&lt;/a&gt;, a biochemist and Brewmaster of C. H. Evans Brewing Company—&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;When light hits beer, it provides the energy necessary to drive a reaction that transforms the iso-alpha-acids into 3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol. The “thiol” part of that somewhat cumbersome name indicates that there is sulfur present. Sulfur compounds often have strong, offensive aromas. Some musteline animals, like skunks, have evolved the ability to produce this chemical, and use it for self-defense. [...] &lt;strong&gt;This photochemical reaction is the only cause of skunked beer. Warm storage, while damaging to the flavor of beer, does not skunk it.&lt;/strong&gt; Cycling the temperature of beer from warm to cold and back again is also not implicated. Storing beer in the dark is the simple way to prevent skunking.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's actually pretty amazing how quickly this reaction can happen! From the same article,&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The photochemical reaction that skunks beer occurs very quickly; a well-hopped beer in clear glass can become noticeably offensive with just 30 seconds of exposure to sunshine. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To wrap it up,&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Since light is an essential ingredient in the skunking process, beers packaged in kegs, cans, and opaque bottles cannot be skunked.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here's the most detailed experiment I could find—&lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2050-0416.2002.tb00568.x/pdf"&gt;The Impact of Lightstruck and Stale Character in Beers on their Perceived Quality: A Consumer Study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The ideal temperature for storing beer is between 10 to 15 ˚C (50 to 59 ˚F). If you are planning to preserve your beer for several years, it is better to have an even lower temperature of about 4 to 10 ˚C (40 - 50 ˚F). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A cold cellar is ideal to preserve your beer as a humidity of about 60% - 65%. The reason being that it can affect the airtightness of the cork (or cap). Dry corks are bad for preserving beer as they will tend to break down and cause wild yiests or bacteria to enter the bottle (which would render the beer undrinkable).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And as commented by Grohlier:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Remember, light can drastically affect beer. Darker bottles can withstand more light than their green and clear counterparts. However, light is not good for beer in general, even if it is stored at the appropriate temperature. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I do not think that the type of cork is important. The important thing is that the cork used seals of the bottle so that no wild yeasts or bacteria are able to enter the bottle. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Traditionally cork and flip-top caps have been used for beers required for preservation, however any seal would do. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In my opinion it's more about tradition than functionality. Just as with french wines plastic corks can actually provide a more durable seal than metallic caps or real corks as they are less susceptible to decay due to moist. However in the spirit of the tradition and to keep customers happy it's often a less preferred option.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For instance, Belgium is a fairly traditional country and you will often never find plastic beer bottles or twist-top caps. Not because they are up to the task, but just because the Belgians didn't like it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer should be chilled to the proper serving temperature, which may vary according to ingredients and brewing methods, and even most of those are not set in stone, but can also vary according to taste.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Guinness, for example, has a specific serving temperature related to how it was traditionally stored in Ireland (Kegs in the "cold" room, which was often just a room carved out of the hill behind the pub or similar).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far a why grocery and convenience stores keep it chilled, it's basically appealing to the "grab and go" drinker, who intends on consuming it in the very near future, or with a short transport. Often they are slightly higher price than if you were to go to a liquor store.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Liquor stores have much larger selection and inventory, and refrigerating everything would be cost prohibitive. The price is generally slightly less than the grab and go locations, although many liqour stores still keep some of the more popular and mainstream beers in the cooler as well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For most commercially available beers, you can cool, warm and recool several times with minimal to no changes to taste. Some craft and/or home brews may be affected more by this process, but I don't know if there is any kind of a list available.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To quote &lt;a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail39.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Strongbad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;"A one that is not cold, is scarcely a one at all."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In supermarkets you will often see the same beers stored in refrigerated and non-refrigerated sections.  Or you may be able to get a beer cold somewhere but only warm somewhere else.  If you go to a large beer store you will see beer of every variety sitting in aisles.  The general reason for keeping beer on ice in a store is so it can be drunk right away.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The one exception I can think of is bottle-conditioned beer.  Beer where some degree of fermentation occurs in the bottle, giving it both natural carbonation and causing the flavor to develop over time.  The flavors the beer will take on during conditioning vary based on warm or cold conditioning, and the beer will have a more limited shelf life.  You will typically only see bottle conditioned beer as a product of home brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When talking about the temperature to store/serve beer it is important to note that there is a difference between types of beer (and what we call beer in the UK and what people call beer in  other countries!).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Cask Marque &lt;a href="http://www.cask-marque.co.uk/beer-information/beer-temperature" rel="nofollow"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; has a simple page denoting the various temperatures that some types of beer/ale should be stored at. It is important to note that some beers also need to be stored upright to ensure any live sediment stays at the bottom of the bottle. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the beer has been conditioned/pasteurized then you should store the beer as cold as possible - 2-5C is good. The biggest negative factor affecting beer storage is oxidative staling, and this proceeds 3 times faster for every 10&amp;deg;C/18&amp;deg;F increase in temperature. Inversely, each drop in temperature of the same amount causes the rate to reduce by the same 3-fold amount.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the beer is still living, then storage temperature will depend upon if the beer has fully conditioned, for example, storing at 15&amp;deg;C until the beer is conditioned and then dropping to lower temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You'll probably do best keeping the room layout simple and as easily organized as possible.  The main thing for the beer is to keep the temperature steady and relatively low (around 50F) and keep light out.  Even with brown bottles there's still some UV penetration, which you want none of.  So keep it dark when you're not in there and try to avoid florescent lighting when you're there.  Keeping it organized also helps you minimize your time in there, which keeps light and temperature steady.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't worry too much about the air flow as long as it's not completely stagnant and all the areas of the room are getting some air of the right temperature.  Liquid and glass hold temperature a lot better than air on their own so they won't have significant fluctuation once you get them where you want them.  I think most collections prefer shallow shelves for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With regards to the beer, 4 things primarily determine the amount and consistency of head:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Types of malt used: light malt typically produces larger, more dish-soapy bubbles. Roasted or dark malts will typically produce smaller bubbles. The proteins in the malt are what determine the consistency of the bubbles. There are additives that can alter and enhance the head forming capabilities of the beer. These are usually forms of protein. One of the best silky mouth feel beers I've ever had is Flying Dog Pearl Necklace Oyster Stout. Yes - they actually add oysters to the brew. The protein makes for an amazing feel.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Amount of carbonation: pretty self explanatory. Mo' gas, mo' bubbles. Higher ABV beers and very malty beers can sometimes hold almost no CO2. Give these a rough pour to produce a decent head.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Type of carbonation: CO2 produces larger bubbles while nitrogen produces very fine small bubbles which gives Guinness its famous silky creamy head.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Conditioning &amp;amp; storage: bottle conditioned beer will hold more CO2 and have a different head and mouth feel and coarser bubbles. kegs carbonated by pressurizing with CO2 will hold less and be a bit foamier.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With regards to the pour, if less head is desired, tilt the glass at least 45 degrees and pour slowly, on the glass, rising as you pour to always be pouring just above the level of the beer. For more head, well... dump 'er in.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The glass will make a difference too. For some high-browed beer-snobbery about cleaning your beer glasses: &lt;a href="http://byo.com/porter/item/425-can-you-explain-the-dos-and-donts-of-cleaning-beer-glasses"&gt;http://byo.com/porter/item/425-can-you-explain-the-dos-and-donts-of-cleaning-beer-glasses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Tank beer does seem to be mainly a Czech thing, although there are some pubs in England that use tanks too. In terms of why it might not be as popular in other countries, there seem to be some downsides: you would need to clean the tanks about once a week, also if you are dealing with unpasteurized beer it must be consumed in a shorter time period which may lead to possible waste of product.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Link to a article of a pub in England with tank beer &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/how-very-refreshing-tank-beer-is-so-fresh-its-like-drinking-straight-from-the-brewery-8560688.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;According to the article you linked to, the specific draw of tank beer is that it's unpasteurized.  This does also exist (albeit not served from tanks) in the form of Real Ale, or Cask Ale in Britain.  Historically, this was not only popular, but the &lt;em&gt;primary&lt;/em&gt; distribution mechanism for beer in Britain a hundred years ago.  However, its popularity has diminished over time because it's harder to transport and doesn't last as long as pasteurized beer, making it more expensive which necessarily reduces the size of the market that can and will pay for it.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Tanked beer is something that you see in brewpubs in the United States, where transportation isn't an issue (since it's being brewed on-site) but real ale is definitely on the decline in the U.K. and possibly only survives due to CAMRA, the British Beer Preservation Society's Campaign for Real Ale. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, I love this question because it is actually interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I researched this when I noticed that bottled coke tasted so much better than canned coke. Cans keep out all light so the contents actually never become tainted. The reason that most like bottled over canned is because they like the taste with those impurities. 
					Some complain that they can taste aluminum with cans, but this is more than likely in their head since cans are lined with a thin layer of plastic. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I like certain beers better in cans and certain ones better in bottles. I would try both :)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I heard a quote from the revered &lt;a href="http://foodscience.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/cbamforth"&gt;Charlie Bamforth&lt;/a&gt;, who basically said that packaging beers in cans was a far better way to preserve the beer from brewery to customer than packaging in bottles, but bottles are still more aesthetically pleasing to the customer, so they are usually preferred. And that's from a man that has been head of Quality Assurance for a number of years. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's purely in the mind - there isn't any real change to the beer. If anything, the difference with bottled beer is that the canned version is better preserved.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is an incomplete answer, but I know that there are some smaller bottles of "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_ale" rel="nofollow"&gt;old ale&lt;/a&gt;" beers which are made for aging.  In particular, there are several from the UK which are sold in the 200-300mL range, such as &lt;a href="http://draftmag.com/cellar/uncapped-44-25-and-4-year-old-thomas-hardys-ale/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Thomas Hardy&lt;/a&gt;'s.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm afraid that I can't tell you anything about the effect (or non-effect) of bottle size.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not really.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt;, larger bottles mean that the little bit of air trapped at the top of the bottle is smaller compared to the volume of beer than it would be in a standard 12 oz bottle.  However, I've been unable to find any research backing this up, and anecdotally it makes no difference.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Larger bottles are favored for aging beers mostly for practical reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Stores are more willing to sell a single large bottle (whereas many often require the purchase of an entire six-pack for smaller beers)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;It's easier to share a large bottle, which you often want to do with a good beer you're aging&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;They're often (but not always) cheaper than the equivalent beer split up between several smaller bottles.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But taste and aging-wise, there's no benefit to larger bottles.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a member of a Studentenverbindung, having one principle of scientia, we of course tested this a long time ago with around a dozen or maybe a bit more testers. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;We poured beer from the same manufacturer (fresh batch) into glasses and had people taste them, and for every glass (everyone had multiple ones) they had to say if they think it was from a bottle, a can, or a keg, and which tasted better.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;After around 50 or 60 glasses, there was no statistical evidence whatsoever that any of the three could be identified, or tasted better.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From my personal experience though, I always think that a keg  is better than a bottle is better than a can. But why is that so? I only have the theory that due to the feeling of the container you drink from, your taste is altered (just like food with the same flavour/taste somehow tastes different, with a different texture). Additionally I think the amount of beer that flows into your mouth is different, as well as maybe the turbulence, causing a different amount of carbon dioxide (or nitrogen, depending on your beer culture) to leave the beer before you can actually taste and swallow (which again changes the texture).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I actually do not think that the can itself changes the taste of the beer as much as the beer placed in the can may be a little different. I think that the real difference is going to be between keg beer and can/bottle beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Canned/bottled beer has a longer shelf life than keg beer. Canned/bottled beer has a shelf life of roughly 45-60 days, whereas a keg is only 25-40 days &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.micromatic.com/beer-questions/how-long-keg-beer-remain-fresh-aid-44.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This means that worst case scenario for comparison you could be tasting a 2 month old canned beer versus a 3 week old draft. It can cause a difference in taste, there is a "freshness date" after all. (See this &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/a/502/303"&gt;excellent answer from @mdma for more information on what happens as beer ages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But where does this date come from? Almost all imported retail beer is pasteurized. The reason for pasteurizing the beer is from a business standpoint. It basically allows the beer to last longer and be shipped at room temperature (this applies to kegs, cans, and bottles). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;An alternative to the pasteurization process is bottle conditioning. Most domestic beers follow this path. Essentially this process involves beers being sterile filtered and chilled to the point that any surviving bacteria, which could ferment the beer, become dormant &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.micromatic.com/beer-questions/pasteurized-and-non-pasteurized-keg-beer-aid-45.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So basically the probability that the beer begins to ferment is higher over time. A canned beer and a keg beer can taste the same if they both left the brewery at the same time, and both experienced the same conditions during the time it took them to reach you. It is just that kegs have a better chance of taking less time and of being better preserved.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From a practical standpoint though, bottles can cause broken glass, kegs weigh close to 50 lbs. full, and cans allow for shotgunning. Make sure your container of choice fits your environment :)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1. &lt;a href="http://www.micromatic.com/beer-questions/how-long-keg-beer-remain-fresh-aid-44.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;How long will a keg of draft beer remain fresh?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					&lt;sub&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://www.micromatic.com/beer-questions/pasteurized-and-non-pasteurized-keg-beer-aid-45.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;What is pasteurized and non-pasteurized keg beer?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I don't know how/if the actual storage in cans vs bottles affects the taste, however you should expect that they are not filled with the same beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Many companies will have different production logistics, and the can will often come from a different site than a bottle of the same brand, and will have slightly different water and production process, so the beers will taste slightly different before they even touch the can; and they may even have intentionally different production and additives.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are drinking beer directly from the can or bottle, then one measurable difference is the speed at which it warms up while you are drinking it.  As glass is an insulator and aluminium is a conductor, you'd expect the can to be more efficient at transferring heat from your hand and the environment into the beer.  So a glass bottle should keep the within the optimum temperature range for longer than the can.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This result is backed up by some &lt;a href="http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-031609-100626/unrestricted/MQPFinal.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;research done by students at Worcester Polytechnic Institute&lt;/a&gt;, which compared the rate at which refrigerated liquid warms up to room temperature in glass and aluminium bottles.  The heating rate differences should be even more noticeable if the bottles were in contact with a body temperature heat source.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This effect can be minimised by insulating the can using a stubby holder/beer cozy.  In another experiment &lt;a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/science/beer_cozy/beer_cozy.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;comparing cans held in a person's hand&lt;/a&gt;, over a 30 minute period an uninsulated can rose in temperature by about 14°C while the insulated can rose only 3°C.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Heat and light are the enemies of beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you have a "bottle conditioned" beer -- that is, one in which live yeast are still present -- then under warmer conditions, you potentially have active yeast. To some extent, this may just increase the carbonation and alcohol content. However, if most of the fermentable sugars have already been fermented (that is, converted to CO2 and alcohol), the yeast will start "eating" each other, which will result in some very "off" flavors (though nothing toxic). Under cooler conditions, the yeast will be only minimally active.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether your beer is "bottle conditioned" or not, the hop acids present from the brewing process don't respond favorably to heat or light. In particular, light can cause them to turn "skunky", which is why Corona -- with their clear glass bottles -- often tastes "skunky". Don't trust a beer in a clear bottle ... seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Keep it cool; keep it dark; keep it upright (unlike wine).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Certain wavelengths of light are responsible for skunking beer. I believe these are mostly in the blue and ultraviolet parts of the spectrum. Brown bottles do the best at blocking out the UV rays. This is why you can get an occasional Rolling Rock that tastes off. I've never heard of a UV reflective coating before, but it makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What follows is probably only relevant if you want to be nit-picky about this:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If it is not in direct sunlight, I'd say your pretty ok. I don't know what your lighting situation is, but I know most incandescent bulbs mostly give off infrared light (I'm not sure if infrared light has been correlated to skunking) and the modern CFL bulbs mostly give off light in the visible spectrum. I'd say both however give off some sort of UV light.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are really concerned, you could tint the cupboard glass. Vehicle window tint is designed to block out UV rays that can damage the interior of cars. Your level of protection depends on how dark you want your tint. If you want the highest protection though, I'd recommend a wooden cupboard.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Every beer has a shelf life. Beer will certainly "last" longer if refrigerated. That is, the flavor will evolve more slowly over time at lower temperatures. Storage at higher than room temperature will invite a turning of the beer's flavor for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In some cases, an aged beer might be considered to have an appealing taste, but still refrigeration will slow the aging process and allow the beer to be kept longer. Additionally, the flavor of highly hopped beers will degrade fairly quickly (within several months) at room temperature, and most people would agree that very hoppy beers in particular &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be refrigerated because of this.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Go to the store and get Bitburger german pilsner in a can, and in a bottle.  Tell me if you taste a difference.  I tried that and the canned stuff is a heck of a lot better tasting than the skunked stuff in the brown glass bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think for short term storage it shouldn't be a problem. It sounds like you're just keeping the bottles in the cupboard outside their cardboard carriers? You could always use the carriers or keep most in carriers in the back and single bottles in the front if you enjoy the appearance of the bottles. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Samuel Adams' carriers are taller for the exact reason of keeping out light, and they use brown bottles so obviously even with brown bottles light is still of some concern.
					&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					I've usually had a problem with beer tasting off if it goes from a refrigerated state to room temperature and then back in the fridge. I've noticed this happens to me more frequently than anything with light.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;No. They are not sufficient, but are one of several necessary conditions to keep beer from going bad. In general, keep beer at a cool temperature (50-60 degrees), away from light, and stand the bottle up (do not lie them sideways like wine bottles are stored). Brown bottles help keep beer away from light, but as a rule of them, store your beer someplace dark. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The short answer is that the beer will not last long after opening, and in most cases you are best off resealing the bottle with an airtight cap/stopper that can withstand mild pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Two things you want to prevent in this situation are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;oxidation of the beer, which will change the taste of a beer.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;loss of carbonation.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For non-carbonated drinks such as wine, a common method to combat oxidation in an opened bottle is to remove the air from the bottle using a vacuum pump.  This is a bad idea for carbonated drinks, since the lower pressure will force carbon dioxide to out of solution causing it to go flat.  One alternative would be to replace the air with an inert gas (perhaps with a product like &lt;a href="http://www.privatepreserve.com/"&gt;Private Preserve&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To minimise loss of carbonation, you really only need to reseal the bottle so it is airtight: carbon dioxide will stop coming out of solution once the pressure builds.  The smaller the air gap in the bottle the faster the pressure will build, so if it is a large bottle with only a small amount of beer left it might make sense to transfer it to a smaller bottle first.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you have a sparkling water maker, you could theoretically use it to force-carbonate a flat beer. You should make sure to keep it cold and sealed however, as exposure to oxygen or sunlight will rapidly degrade the flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I typically drink all of the beer in a sitting, or share it with someone. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, if you need to save it, a good cork will work. Pour the beer you want in a glass, cork it and return it to whatever cooling method you used before.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Temperature changes aren't great for beers, especially hoppy beers, because temperature swings of greater than 20 degrees will degrade flavor.  But it takes a LOT of that to produce a noticeable effect.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most beer probably went through a few cycles of heating and cooling before it gets to your fridge, especially in the summer.  You know, maybe cold in the brewery but warmed in the truck before cooled in the warehouse then warm in the truck again before hitting a store's cooler.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It'd be hard to notice anything.  Hoppy beers might have their big aromas fade a bit or get a less smooth bitterness.  Anecdotally, some of the smoother DIPA style beers with big floral or citrus hop smells/tastes might degrade into more biting bitter territory.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Big beers made for aging will generally be forgiving but heating and cooling them a lot might make them taste flatter or cardboardy.  But again, we're talking several upon several times before anything noticeable happens.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Long story short...it's probably not going to do anything you're going to notice chilling unopened beers back down from room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beers that are high in ABV, have been bottle-conditioned or have been barrel-aged are prime for aging and cellaring. Usually the brewer will say on the bottle or their website what the max amount of suggested aging time is. For instance, Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout state "develops over 5 years in the bottle." I bought a case of 2012 and have one about every 6 months...and they get better and better.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;They should have been kept at about 50-55 degrees over the time of aging. What did you have them at?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The likely answer is somewhere between carbonation pressure and marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's hard to find numbers for how much caps can handle vs corks but you should notice that most corked beers also come in bottles with very thick glass, this is because the beer inside is at a higher pressure than most other styles.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most beer styles will fall pretty close to 2.0 or 2.5 volumes of CO2 (just the term, think of the number as a relative baseline), but a lot of Belgian strong beers like Bierre de Garde or Tripel will be carbonated with 3.3+ volumes.  Lambics and other sour beers can go up to 4.5 volumes.  This is a linear scale so that becomes possibly twice as much pressure as a normal bottle...so yeah, thicker glass.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;At such high pressure you might find corks will stay put more reliably than a cap since it has more surface area in contact with the bottle.  It also might provide a more airtight seal than a cap for long-term aging.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Those would be technical considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Corking also predated capping so there's also a very traditional feel about a bottle with a cork and a cage, which can fit into the traditional image a lot of breweries market themselves using.  I say I'm not sure and it could just be marketing because a lot of Wheat styles like German Wheats, Belgian Wits, etc are fairly highly carbonated (near the 3.3 volumes range) but most of them have no problems being capped.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As to the affect on taste?  Nada, apart from hypothetical aging concerns...unless mistreated you should not taste the cork.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A cap is not going to fly off a bottle unless it is not properly seated, no matter the carbonation. It is crimped onto the bottle. The bottle will first explode. It is also incorrect that a cork is necessary for higher carbonated beers. Many of the styles identified at higher carbonation volumes also come in capped bottles (particularly 375ml bottles). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Corks do provide a better seal that slows the flow of air into the beer so those bottles will age more slowly than bottles with caps. That is the primary technical difference between the two.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The primary reasons for corking beer today is marketing. In some areas where corked bottles were traditionally used for bottling it was easier to get champagne bottles or similar bottles that could support carbonation and corking became a matter of convenience as it was cheaper to source bottles locally. However, now it is just a matter of marketing the product. All other corked bottles went into large format, corked bottles to make them look like a classier product than a six pack and legitimize higher prices in the customers' eyes. That is true for the beers you find on the market today in almost all cases. Very few beers go into corked bottles because the brewer truly believes it is necessary for the long term quality of the beer in a way that a cap or a cap plus wax would not provide.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There should be no reason why beer would lose any quality from being left out at room tempreture then being re-cooled.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;During the brewing and distribution process beer is exposed to a wide range of tempretures numerious times. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some specialst beers may include "adjuncts" or additional ingredients(fruit, honey etc...) that may be effect quality with a tempreture range (none spring to mind).However normal beer made with malt, hops &amp;amp; water should be fine.&lt;br&gt;
					Exposure to sunlight is more likely to affect beer than temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It would be safe to drink, in the sense of it would not cause any harm to you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer is very resistant to heat, it will preffer to be stored in a cold location, but will probably not go bad at room temperature for extended periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What really spoil it is is UV light.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But everything changes when the beer is opened, it should then be drinked on the spot, because it will soon loose all its CO2 and start oxidizing, making it terrible and probably hazardous.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;IPAs don't age well, or at all. The sooner they're consumed, the better they taste (or taste as intended). Are most of the craft beers you have, IPAs? If so, a &lt;em&gt;"Best by:"&lt;/em&gt; would make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, some styles taste better aged, &lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; barleywines, imperial souts, sours. You definitely wouldn't see a &lt;em&gt;"Best by:"&lt;/em&gt; for these types, and in fact you might even see a &lt;em&gt;"Best after:"&lt;/em&gt;. So perhaps the &lt;em&gt;"Born on:"&lt;/em&gt; label is a way of letting the enthusiast decide how long to age a beer, without feeling forced to wait a minimum number of months or years.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Would you happen to know or remember the styles (or even better, the exact name) of the beers that said &lt;em&gt;"Best by:"&lt;/em&gt; vs. &lt;em&gt;"Born on:"&lt;/em&gt;? Then perhaps we could validate or invalidate this explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Edit&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Anheiser-Busch is the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; entity that may use &lt;em&gt;"Born on:"&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/community/threads/why-dont-all-craft-brewers-post-a-uniform-born-on-date-on-their-beer.94778/#post-1388239" rel="noreferrer"&gt;as they've trademarked it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But anyway, it turns out that another class of beers that typically have production dates are macros (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; American Adjunct Lagers), not because they taste better aged, but for a mix of several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;profit-maximization (purportedly),&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;tracking problems and policing freshness,&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;giving consumers an (illusory) sense of regulatory safety,&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;and giving enthusiasts control over when they'd like to consume a beer.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A Lagunitas employee quoted in the aforementioned link claims that&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Bud only really did it to reduce brewery and distributor inventories and wring a one-time load of cash out of the company...&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;and goes on to say that Lagunitas labels production dates&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;to track problems [...] and to give our distributors the ability (if they will use it) to police freshness.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A bit biased, but I can believe some elements of both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/community/threads/why-hide-the-freshness-date.90690/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/community/threads/bottled-date-should-be-mandatory.67705/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;threads&lt;/a&gt; on BeerAdvocate suggest that some consumers feel better (even might only drink a beer) when a production date is printed, whether it gives them an illusory sense of regulatory safety or they actually know enough about beer to know if and how long to age them.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It won't hurt you, lactose (the 'key' ingredient of milk stouts) doesn't need to be refrigerated the way actual milk does. However, it is advisable to keep milk stouts refrigerated for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;1) They generally don't age particularly well, so keeping them in the fridge will best preserve the taste.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;2) If a milk stout isn't pasteurized the lactose can provide unfermented carbohydrates for infections to feast on if any bacteria is present. But keeping it in the fridge will drastically slow down any potential infection.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Well you're going to be the genius here, because as it turns out, they're both wrong.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, we're going to eliminate "novel" options for cooling, like liquid nitrogen and fire extinguishers, and limit ourselves to ways we can cool bottles every day in the freezer.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What we need to maximize here is thermal conductivity.  Since the goal here is homeostasis, we need to move heat out of the bottle and into the surrounding medium as quickly as possible.  And air, as it turns out, is a pretty lousy conductor.  So that makes your first friend most wrong.  Keeping the bottle dry will cool it eventually, but quite slowly.   However, ice isn't &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much better.  Because there's a lot of air still touching the bottle when it's in ice.  It'll cool it better, but it's certainly still not the best option.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The best option, it turns out, is an ice water mixture, with a healthy dose of salt to help keep the water liquid, even below 0 degrees Celsius.  Water happens to be an excellent conductor, and with ice to keep it cold and salt to keep it liquid, can draw heat out of bottles faster than any other non-exotic method, by a significant margin.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, if you want to cool your bottles quickly. and ice-water bath is the ticket. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;The Life of Wine (after opening)&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The short answer is approximately 3-5 days, but it all depends on the type of wine. There are a number of factors at play when it comes to the life of wine, after it has been opened.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These include acetic acid bacteria that consumes the alcohol in wine and metabolizes it into acetic acid and acetaldehyde. This causes the wine to have a sharp, vinegar-like smell.  Additionally, the alcohol can oxidize, causing a nutty, bruised fruit taste, that robs the wine of fresh, fruity flavors. These are both chemical reactions, and so the lower the temperature you keep a wine at, the slower this will happen.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Please see link for full reference and detailed breakdown of How long wine lasts after opening: &lt;a href="http://winefolly.com/tutorial/how-long-opened-wine-lasts/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://winefolly.com/tutorial/how-long-opened-wine-lasts/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When I don't have ice to cold a beer, I put a napkin around the bottle and wet it in the sink and then put it into the freezer. In my experience, this way takes less time to cold a beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I put a teaspoon or a fork in the bottle. 
					Empirically it works, but I don't know exactly what physics laws are involved. 
					This method will allow you to keep carbonation longer. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I buy growlers and as soon as I open one I will pour what I am not going to drink into containers I can top off.  It easily keeps for 2-3 days in the fridge. Even at 7 days it is just a bit flat.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A bigger air gap lets more CO2 escape.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I will drink directly out of the canteen to not lose more CO2 on a second pour.  And pour carefully the first time.  It may be me but I think a pouring into a chilled canteen has less head.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For small you can use kids canteens - this is 12 oz and you can get a regular lid&lt;br&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hard spirits naturally &lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-0277.2009.01116.x/full" rel="noreferrer"&gt;degrade over time once opened&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You've already opened the bottle because you wanted to actually enjoy the drink, here are step you can take to help ensure the slow and unstoppable flavor degradation takes as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Store out of the light in a cool and dry place. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A good general rule of thumb for just about any type of alcohol is to store the bottles in a cool, dry, and dark location this will prevent any fluctuation in the environment from causing changes and prevent UV radiation from getting in. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Keep the bottle completely sealed.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.alcademics.com/2015/09/science-on-how-spirits-change-or-age-in-the-bottle-rather-than-the-barrel.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Whiskey and other spirits will not mature&lt;/a&gt; like a wine in a bottle over time, in fact using an open cork will likely contribute to the breakdown of the flavor as the spirit will have more opportunity to oxidize. A proper rubber stop/cork will do the job just fine. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to "age" a whiskey your best bet would be to store it in a small used whiskey cask or in a sealed class bottle with whiskey cask staves added. Both will allow the whiskey to absorb more flavors over time. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You should &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; keep the cork wet. The high alcohol content of most distilled spirits will begin to dissolve the cork, which is highly undesirable. They should always be stored upright. This applies to metal screw tops as well, as metal catalyzes the breakdown of organic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To improve the lifespan, the best thing you can do is keep the bottle in a cool, dark place. While it is true oxidation cannot happen without air, it is far slower without energy present, and reducing light-heat is much easier than removing air.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are able to keep the bottle in complete dark and below ~70F, it will last far longer. I store mine in a cabinet in my kitchen, and I have an Islay Scotch that has been open for 4 years and shows no signs of degrading, despite smoke being among the most easily destroyed flavors.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always void sunlight.&lt;/strong&gt; UV will quickly degrade the flavor of spirits. While the glass of most bottles blocks some UV, any getting through is extremely harmful.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Something else that can be done is to transfer partially filled bottles into smaller bottles. If you have half of a 0.750L, you might transfer it into 0.375L. This would reduce surface area and the amount of air in the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are committed to preserving a bottle that you do not often use, wine stores sell cans of Xenon which can be sprayed into bottles. The Xenon is heavier than air and covers the surface, preventing oxygen from coming in contact with the liquid. However, this is fairly expensive and will not prevent forms of heat/light degradation other than oxidation&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have read a lot on this and keep finding it's a myth. I am a raging alchy and drink beer all the time. I get this bud from Walgreen's and they have a horrible stocking procedure, I know for sure the beer is cold, then they let it get warm, then refridge it (the cans are always sweating). It's been 5 times I've drank this bud from them and all the time my stomach kills me from it. I think it, for some reason, creates more gas (lot of foam in my stomach, feeling like I have to burp, but cannot). I drink the same amount of beer on any given day from a good distributor and have no problems. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Side note to add, the beer also has a lemony taste to it, so I don't know exactly the chemical reaction,but I'm positive that going from cold to room temp, then cold again screws the beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So... the short answer is novelty... and possibly, less beer loss per firkin if the CO2 is causing the beer to be head-y and a lot of beer gets wasted when bartenders pour through the foam.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The more complex answer is - as long as a beer is in a metal firkin... there should be no discerning difference in quality/taste/etc. The difference would come in the form of wooden firkins. If, for example, you had a Stout on tap and the same stout served in a wooden firkin, the longer the beer stayed in the wooden firkin, the more the flavors would change. Especially if the wooden firkin was previously used to make a spirit (like bourbon).  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the latter - bourbon barrrel - the longer the beer stays in, the more of the bourbon flavor shines through.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes the same beer from a cask and a keg will be VERY different.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To your first point, breweries and bars will often have specially treated casks in ways that are impossible to do with kegs.  Stuff like dry-hopping the beer in the cask at the bar so it's at its freshest and most intense.  With a keg you'd need to put this between the tap and the glass like a Randall but with a cask you can just pop the cap and shove whatever you want in there.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Casked beer also generally still have active yeast in it, at least according to CAMRA's rules, while kegs are filtered and have no yeast in them.  Because of this there's a lot of preparation involved in a proper real ale cask.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cask will come sealed from the brewery.  First a soft spile or peg must be driven into the top hole.  This is just a porous plug that allows air out.  Based on how foamy this gets the bar can see how active the yeast is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the yeast dies down the soft spile gets replaced with a hard spile which stops gas exchange.  The cask then has to sit for a while so all the yeast can fall to the bottom as well as any other particulates or large proteins in the beer.  This is called "Dropping Bright"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, once the beer has dropped bright the cask can be tapped which involves removing the hard spile and also either hooking up the side hole to a beer engine or a simple tap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Because of all this and traditionally being served from a cellar or bartop at "cellar temperature" vs kegs which are refrigerated the beer that comes out will be slightly warmer (40-50F vs 30-40F), much slower because of the pumping and off-gassing from the pour, and way less carbonated.  Some beer engines will also use "sparkler" taps that fizz up the beer even more on the way out to generate more head but also results in a less carbonated beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The result is a beer that will generally be smoother and rounder, you may get more flavor and more sweetness since it's warmer.  Some flavors will come out more in the warmer and less carbonated and some will be overshadowed.  Mouthfeel will be affected a lot by both factors as well.  It's a hugely different animal and sometimes people like it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some tips:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Protect your bottles from sunlight and extreme temperatures. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;If your bottles have cork tops, make sure to keep the corks moist so that they don't disintegrate (just turning the bottles upside down every month or so for a few seconds does wonders). &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;As the level in each bottle drops, consider transferring the contents to a smaller bottle. This prevents volatiles from leaving the liquid and also excludes oxygen from the bottle (though whether you're mixing in extra oxygen during the transfer is perhaps a worry). If you know beforehand that you will take your time on a certain bottle, I'd rebottle it at the outset.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;If you already own it for wine (or are otherwise serious about keeping half-empty bottles for a long time), you could also use something like an inert gas wine preserver (e.g. PrivatE PreservE or Winesave PRO) to add a layer of what is basically Argon over the liquid. I haven't tried this.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Vermouths and other alcohols ~20% ABV don't keep well for long once opened. Treat them like wine: drink them faster or open fewer of them. They will lose their aromas, then oxidize, and finally turn to vinegar.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Liqueurs with low &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_activity" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;water activity&lt;/a&gt; (read: lots of sugar) will probably stay safe to consume for quite a long time (years), but they are still prone to oxidization leading to off flavors. Re-bottle at the outset if you must, or consume faster, or discard and buy new.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Consider storing your bitters in the fridge.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Quick answer no. The yeast used should have very little effect on on the expiry date. Things that will affect this more are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Temperature of fermentation&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Hot side aeration&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Cold side aeration&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Pasteurization&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Filtration&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Colour of bottle the beer is stored in&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Type of beer ie % dark malts&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Live product vs sterile filtered&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This list is incomplete. This is an incredibly complex subject, there are PhDs in Brewing/Chemistry handed out for small aspects of each of these topics.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is a quick overview presentation of the technical aspects surrounding beer stability and stabilisation. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Actually, this does happen - but, perhaps 'explode' is a bit of a dramatic term to use... 'Spring a leak' is more like it; because the building pressure would pop the seal of the barrel in order to off-gas.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Check out this thread from the Homebrewing beta:
					&lt;a href="https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/8048/flat-beer-after-priming-in-a-pressure-barrel"&gt;Flat beer after priming in a pressure barrel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;That's probably the main culprit (CO2 leak).&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, this brewer describes the exact same scenario occurring during a couple of his brews due to a specific yeast:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I decided to dig into this because I have been home brewing off and on for 20 years and never really used a pressure barrel. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Home-Brew-Balliihoo-Temperature-Indicator/dp/B001QMRRHA" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Pressure Barrels&lt;/a&gt; seem to be more widely used in the UK and Australian markets than in the USA where we use Cornelius kegs instead. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Pressure barrels are made out of plastic and come in a variety of sizes, the most common seem to be about the 5 gallon/25 liter size. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To use a pressure barrel you move your freshly fermented beer into this vessel and prime with some type of sugar and let it sit for a couple of weeks while it builds up carbonation. Then you serve from the tap.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;They are designed to withstand a lot of pressure, but I am sure there is a theoretical limit that I couldn't find. However, they do come with a pressure relief valve in the lid that limits the pressure to give you carbonation within certain parameters and to protect you from the scenario asked above.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I did find this on a &lt;a href="http://www.home-brew-online.co.uk/instructions/HBO-pressure-barrel-instructions-leaflet.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;pdf on the web&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Whichever cap you have they are designed to release excess pressure, sometimes barrels may bulge under the pressure, but the cap should automatically release when needed. If needed pressure can be released manually by slightly opening the lid by unscrewing and allowing CO2 out, if for example the holes on the cap had become blocked. Between brews check the caps are clean and free from any build up which could stop them from releasing pressure, and make sure they are well cleaned in clean warm water to ensure the rubber 'bands' are not stuck in position with any sticky liquid that may have come into contact with them.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Let say, for argument's sake, that the pressure relief valve was stuck and you put waaaay too much priming sugar in. I don't think the pressure barrel would ever explode. There are two weak points that would probably fail before it go to that point and that's the lid and the serving valve which would both probably vent before it got to that pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, to answer this question, there is almost zero chance it would explode and would probably just have a leak of some type with infinite yeast and sugar.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Madeira is a fortified wine and very very sturdy. Pretty hard to ruin it.  I would not decant it but let it settle to the proper temperature. If you have it too cold you miss some of the flavor and too warm the alcohol is too prominent. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.vinhomadeira.pt/Temperature-208.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://www.vinhomadeira.pt/Temperature-208.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is usually recommended that the wine be served at between 13 and 14º for younger wines while older wines, given their greater complexity, should be served at a temperature varying between 15ºC and 16ºC.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I don't have any first hand knowledge about this, but I've heard this can be dangerous. Since tequila has alcohol, it isn't going to freeze. Depending on how cold the freezer is there may be potential for damage to tissues in your mouth. Perhaps this is or isn't true, but you might want to do some research before trying it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I did some casual Googling and found a lot of people freezing booze and drinking so perhaps typical freezer temperatures are Okay. One worrisome hit was &lt;a href="http://www.sharpman.com/combating_the_deep_freeze_cold_weather_injury_prevention.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this however&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Conduction is the transfer of heat to objects or substances in direct
					  contact. Your tongue sticking to the flagpole in grade school is a
					  perfect example of how tissue can almost instantly freeze when in
					  contact with cold metal, an excellent heat conductor. Keep in mind
					  that alcohol is also an excellent conductor and often freezes at much
					  colder temperatures than water, so if you bring a beer out on your
					  next cold-weather adventure, don’t throw back a few swigs until you’ve
					  checked its temperature. &lt;strong&gt;Extremely cold alcohol can instantly freeze
					  and damage your lips, tongue or other mouth tissue. And if the alcohol
					  comes in contact with your throat or esophagus, that can turn out to
					  be deadly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Storing tequila in the freezer?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I doubt that storing tequila in your freezer will make it taste better, but under certain conditions it could preserve the great taste of tequila. Storing your liquor in general in a freezer is not a bad idea at all, but is only possibly necessary at certain times.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;For the most part, there’s no need to refrigerate or freeze liquor whether it’s still sealed or already opened.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Hard liquors like vodka, rum, &lt;strong&gt;tequila&lt;/strong&gt;, and whiskey; most liqueurs, including Campari, St. Germain, Cointreau, and Pimm’s; and bitters are perfectly safe to store at room temperature. Essentially every liquor mentioned in this Bar Cart post on stocking your home bar with the &lt;em&gt;notable exception of already-opened vermouth&lt;/em&gt; can and should be stored without refrigeration.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;That notable exception of vermouth I mentioned above is because vermouth is actually a fortified wine. And like regular wine, it will eventually oxidize, so it needs to remain in the fridge once it’s been uncorked. Vermouth and dessert wines like vin santo, ice wine, and the like thankfully have a longer refrigerator shelf life than their regular wine counterparts, and won’t turn vinegary and sour in the span of a few days. But they will slowly start to lose their nuances of flavor, and after a few months—six, max—they’re probably goners. - &lt;a href="https://www.goodfoodstories.com/liquor-storage/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;How Should I Store My Booze?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Storing tequila&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Like almost any other alcohol (besides some liqueurs), tequila should be stored in a cool and dry area. Therefore, the pantry seems to be the best possible choice, but if you don’t plan to open the bottle within the next few weeks or months, you can store it in the cellar (if there’s not enough space in the pantry). After opening the bottle please remember that you should always keep the bottle tightly sealed when not in use. Don’t ever store it with a pourer on or without its cap.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Tightly sealed bottle ensures two things. First – any impurities won’t be able to find their way into the bottle. Second – if the bottle stays opened without its cap, the liquid evaporates quicker than when it’s sealed. Because alcohol evaporates quicker than water, your tequila will slowly become milder with time (after opening the bottle for the first time).&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;When the bottle is less than half full and you won’t consume the rest of its contents within a couple of weeks, it’s a good idea to pour the liquid into a smaller bottle. More air in the bottle equals faster evaporation and oxidation, both of them causing the quality of tequila to slowly deteriorate. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The  shelf life of tequila is indefinite if the seal remains undamaged. If not consuming your tequila in a relatively short time I would not hesitate to put it in the refrigerat&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;First thing that not everyone is familiar with is that spirits, unlike wines, don’t age after being bottled. &lt;strong&gt;That means that storing tequila for years won’t make its taste better.&lt;/strong&gt; When it comes to shelf life of tequila, it’s basically indefinite, as long as its seal isn’t compromised. If you store an unopened bottle in the pantry for quite a few years now, you can be almost sure that it’s fine now and it should be of great quality. After the bottle is opened for the first time, it’s recommended to drink tequila within a couple of months, when its quality is still at its best.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With freezing temperatures be sure your bottles will not explode.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The average home freezer is about &lt;strong&gt;-17 C (-1 F).&lt;/strong&gt; This is cold enough to freeze your food and ice, but not cold enough to freeze the average bottle of 80-proof liquor.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;■ Storing your favorite bottle of vodka in the freezer is okay.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;■ Placing that prized limoncello in the freezer for a quick chill is a good idea. &lt;a href="https://www.thespruce.com/will-liquor-freeze-760302" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;What is the Freezing Point of Alcohol?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yeah, tequila in the freezer is fine, and so is vodka, genever etc. Pour it in a shot glass, enjoy the syrupy texture and the foggy glass, have a small sip...you can't take a gulp because of the temperature. You probably can't taste much either due to frozen taste buds, but's it's a cool conversation starter and it saves on ice cubes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's perfectly fine to leave a bottle of red wine in the fridge if you can't finish it that day. In fact that is the best way to preserve an open bottle if you have no other way. You can extend the life of an opened bottle of red wine by a couple of days by sticking it in the fridge. Room temperature red wine starts to get funky around day 3 while in a fridge it might be 5 or 6 days. It really depends on the wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The only problem, unless you like cold red wine (if you've ever been to Paris, you know that's how they serve it), you will need to let it sit out in a glass until it warms up. Make sure you put a cork or some other stopper back in the top of the bottle to slow down the rate of oxidation. Personally, I like my red wine served at cellar temperature (around 50f). I think it makes the red wine easier to drink. Nobody likes hot red wine unless you are making Gluhwein. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is generally preferred to store wine on it's side, but I think the climate the wine is stored is even more important. Generally, a wine like a vintage port, will spend only a short part of it's lifetime on a shelf in a store. I really doubt that even a year or two will dry out the cork unless the humidity levels are very low. One way to check if the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ullage_(wine)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;ullage&lt;/a&gt; level is low. Ideally, any wine that you want to age should be kept on it's side, in a dark, cool location. Moving the wine upright and back once a years is not ideal. Will it hurt the Port? I really doubt it. Port is pretty sturdy stuff since it's fortified. I wouldn't worry too much about it. The age is also a factor. If it's 10 years old, that's nothing for a port. If it's 50 years old, then I start to worry about it...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Aged Whiskey has gone through the majority of its chemical changes during barrel aging. It has been oxidized and condensed. The final product is generally stable, however further evaporation of liquids will occur over time just as in the barrel aging process, so storage in airtight containers would be recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sunlight has been known to increase the amount of substances like hydroxymethlyfurfurals in stored alcoholic beverages like mead and wine. I have not read any studies in direct correlation with whiskey, but with residual sugar present the production seems likely, thus storage in darkness, or non-UV light would also likely be a positive for long term storage.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Whiskey's shelf stability, especially if sealed, will bypass that of wine providing one of the most harsh environments for any sort of spoilage organism to take hold, with it's high ethanol content, as well as being more acidic than many more neutral liquors such as vodka.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A couple at time does not reduce the amount of ice you need to replace.  The cooler has the same insulation and same surface area.  It will have the same heat loss.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Why put it on ice when you get there?  Pack the cooler before you leave and ice it down.  Top off the cooler at the last store.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I suggest a separate cooler for drinks as you are in and out of it more.  If ice runs out nothing will spoil.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for food you can get a week in a good cooler.  Pack as many foods frozen as possible.  Open and close as few a times as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Actually beers from Anheiser Busch have preservatives in them witch it can get warm or cold or whatever. Coors beer products on the other hand do not have preservatives and have to stay cold all the time. I worked for Coors Distributing and we kept the beer cold on the train to the warehouse to the trucks, to the customer. All refrigerated.the whole way. That is all I know that i was told.. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The only concern I'd see right away would be making sure you don't lose your deposit if you have a blow out during fermentation and beer sprays all around.  I've not done it in an apartment, but I just use my stove and a wort chiller that attaches to my sink, so there isn't anything in that process that would be a problem in an apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I suppose if you want to use a big propane burner for boiling the wort you might need to check if such things are permitted at your property.  If they don't allow BBQs you probably couldn't use that type of burner.  If you've got the time you should be able to do it on most stove tops though.  And more time to brew means more time to enjoy previously brewed after all!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For the fermentation, ideally you'll want a dark place that's reasonably temperature controlled, but if your apartment has its temps in a reasonable range you could probably make it work without a special fermentation chamber--which you could also likely buy or make if you care enough to.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Can you brew in an apartment?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The short answer is &lt;strong&gt;yes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is a nice read. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;I brewed my first batch of beer in my tiny Syracuse apartment while the snow piled up outside. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Some people are turned off by the idea of small-batch brewing (one to two gallon batches) because they like to produce beer in larger volumes (five to ten gallon batches), and that’s okay—I like beer as much as the next guy, and having a large supply of it is (almost) never a bad thing. There's also a lot of comfort in that many of the homebrewing recipes and kits available cater to the familiar 5-gallon scale. However, there are a number of distinct advantages to small-batch brewing—especially for people living in small spaces—that I’ve come to realize over the years. In this post, I’ll share a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ol&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Your Significant Other Won't Lose a Closet&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;A 5-gallon batch of beer will fill about 50 12-ounce bottles. That’s a lot of beer to store in your living space—even if you are drinking a few a day. And don't forget the pair of 5-gallon buckets you'll need to stash somewhere. At the 1-gallon scale, a single batch of home brew can fit in your fridge (easy access!), and your equipment can sit right on your countertop. Sourcing and storing ingredients is a breeze as well, as most 1-gallon recipes use between 2 and 3 pounds of grain, significantly less than their 5-gallon counterparts. Trust me, your significant other will thank you for the extra space!&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WgYrQ.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WgYrQ.jpg" alt="Brew storage in a closet"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Brew storage in a closet&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ol start="2"&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;The Cost to Produce Won't Break the Bank&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Of course, there’s something to be said for the economies of scale you can experience when buying ingredients in bulk. But as mentioned above, urban dwellers don’t always have the luxury of extra space. And when making only one to two gallon batches, picking up everything you need at the homebrewing supply store won’t break the bank. If you have a favorite recipe, you can scale it down proportionately.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ol start="3"&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;You'll Avoid Some of the Risk&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;For any homebrewer who’s learned a lesson in sanitation the hard way or woke up in the middle of the night to a symphony of bottle bombs exploding, you know it’s a total bummer. But as you scale down the cost of your brew, a bad batch poses less risk to your bottom line. This can be especially beneficial if you’re brewing with some expensive ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ol start="4"&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;You'll Brew More Often and Learn Faster&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;For most homebrewers, it doesn’t always make sense to brew a five or ten gallon batch every two weeks, especially when a brew can consume the better part of a day. But with small batch brewing if you've got the funds, it's pretty easy to routinely pump out a gallon or two at a time. A shorter process means you're likely to brew more often. Home brewing is so much of a learning-by-doing hobby, that this type of iterative process can elevate your skills at a much faster rate. Testing out variations on the same recipe between small batches is a great way to perfect your beer!&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ol start="5"&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;A Hot Plate Could Provide the Heat You Need&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Brewing a five or ten gallon batch requires a lot of water and considerable heat to achieve the right boil. This is why you might have seen some "homebrewing porn" pictures with an awesome garage setup that includes propane burners. We love those, but that's not practical in a small apartment, especially if you're limited to an "apartment-sized" appliance. With small batch brewing, you can brew quickly and easily with as little as a hot plate.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ol start="6"&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;You Can Clock a Brew In Two Hours Or Less&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Just about anyone who's brewed a 5+ gallon batch of beer has spent a long night patiently waiting for water to boil, and after brewing, waiting for the beer to cool to the proper temperature. Although those can be among the most rewarding nights for some, a quicker process is a great bonus for most small-batch brewers, and helps us squeeze in an evening of brewing beer even during a busy week. With a brewing process which can clock in at under two hours from start to finish, brewing small has convenience on its side. You'll need little more than a stirring spoon and your arm to craft a tasty batch of beer. In contrast, the logistical "bigness" of a 10-gallon batch can be a big turnoff for some—lugging hefty pots of water and grain hither and yon is a daunting task. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ol start="7"&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;It's a Perfect Recipe For Experimentation&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The size of your batch does not have to limit the amount of creativity you put into each one. However, the frequency, cost and required storage can absolutely be limiting factors. Brewing small means you're free to experiment with a variety of styles and recipes without going "all-in." With such a quick turnover between batches, you can always keep your fridge stocked with new and interesting choices. Suddenly you can lager your beer without a dedicated fridge, or test out some new and different ingredients you've had your eye on. Oyster stout, anyone?&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ol start="8"&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Cleaning Up Is a Cinch&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;With larger batch brewing, you can easily generate 15 to 30 pounds of wet grain. Managing that waste is a challenge for home brewers living in a city apartment--especially when taking out the trash is already a hassle. Wouldn't you rather deal with 3-5 pounds of waste instead? Better yet, with even a little culinary flair, you can turn your spent grain into all manner of delectable treats!&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ol start="9"&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;You're Less Likely to Burn Something&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Not that you hear about too many homebrewing-related house fires or injuries, it's worth mentioning that brewing in smaller batches gives you a bit more control over what's happening. Coupled with the fact that it's a shorter process, better control more often than not results in a safer brew. Handling big volumes of heated water can result in burns, and over time, large 5-gallon glass carboys can weaken and be quite dangerous when they shatter—not to mention the loss of an entire batch of beer. - &lt;a href="https://www.boxbrewkits.com/blogs/news/25580484-9-reasons-urban-dwellers-should-consider-small-batch-brewing" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;9 Reasons Urban Dwellers Should Consider Small-Batch Brewing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes, they will.   Given beer is (generally speaking) more than 90% water, and water expands when frozen, beer will make a mess of your freezer if left in there too long.  The bottles themselves don't tend to break, in my experience, but the cap seals fail and the beer will leak out everywhere.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;They do not explode (in a sense of explosion crushing your freezer) but may break. I have forgotten once three (different) bottles of beer in the freezer over night. Results: a) broken off bottom, b) sealed off cap, c) nothing happened (with the bottle, the beer turned to beer-ice of course). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Bottles do not necessarily break or open. Seems to depend on the thickness of the glass. These three bottles stick together by ice. Brazilians love ice-cold beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To get beer as cold as possible, as quickly as possible, it should be submerged in a salted ice water bath.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Because of the alcohol in beer, the freezing temperature of beer is slightly lower than that of water.  (How much lower depends on the actual alcohol content of the beer you're cooling.)  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The salt in the ice water will in turn lower the freezing temperature of the water slightly, ensuring it is as cold as possible, and the conduction cooling of the water against the cans or bottles will cool them much more rapidly than exposing them primarily to cold air, as they would be either in a freezer or in ice alone.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Additionally, since the temperature of ice-water will naturally be moderated by the water, you don't have to worry about your beer freezing, no matter how long you leave it it, and it will get as cold as it is going to get within 15 mintues or so.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You could make this a DIY Project. I have a beer fridge that I made from a chest freezer, thermostat, and a heat lamp. I modified the chest freezer that I got from home depot for like $250 bucks and I connected it to a control box (like $20) that turns on and off the freezer when it reaches a certain temperature and turns on and off the heat lamp at a certain temperature. And as a nice touch, I added a renewable dehumidifier to keep the fridge from leaking. Works very well. I have my beer at serving temperatures at all times. It definitely makes a difference in the flavor of the beer and it makes for a great fermentation chamber when I am homebrewing.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Materials&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Temperature Controller w/ 2 relays &lt;a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00OXPE8U6" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OXPE8U6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Project Box to put the temperature controller in, you will want tools to make holes in it. &lt;a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0002BSRIO" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002BSRIO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;a chest freezer&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;an outlet and outlet cover&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;heat lamp, bulb to cord connector, cord that has the outlet plug attached.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;some electrical wire &lt;a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B01LH1FQJ0" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LH1FQJ0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Renewable Dehumidifier &lt;a href="https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/eva-dry-renewable-mini-dehumidifier/1018939665" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/eva-dry-renewable-mini-dehumidifier/1018939665&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Shrink waterproof rubber to connect all the 3 piece heat lamp set up together. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Here is an example of someone that went all out and made a trim. I did not do this but it is a good example: &lt;a href="https://www.homebrewtalk.com/forum/threads/jacks-chest-freezer-fermentation-chamber.231979/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.homebrewtalk.com/forum/threads/jacks-chest-freezer-fermentation-chamber.231979/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You could follow those steps up there ^. I have yet to do the wood trim, but you can do all of this without the trim. I am using a heat lamp from home depot instead of an actual heater like that. The heat lamp is 3 parts which are purchased separately: the lamp, the connector from the lamp to a hot and ground wire, and then plug end that plugs into an outlet. You can connect all of these with a shrink rubber that is waterproof.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It took me about two hours to make (only because I struggled with making the right sized holes in the project box). It takes very little electrical knowledge to complete this.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A freezer is too cold and fridge not cold enough.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The alcohol reduces the freezing point by 0.4 C for each 1% of alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So you would need a freezer with a temperature control.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Since is is not far below freezing point of water you could use an ice bath and be pretty close. A 10% salt solution is about -6 C.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Don't fool around with freezer or salted water! Either get about 1 gallon of food grade Glycol or Everclear alcohol and put it in your freezer until it's -10F. You can leave it in the bottle or put it in a bucket. Be careful handling it because you can instantly cause frost bite if it comes into contact with your skin. Use gloves. Take it out of the freezer and pour into a metal or pyrex bucket. Stick your wine or beer bottle into it and swirl the liquid around it the bottle. It should get to freezing within a couple of minutes of soaking the bottles. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Since the question doesn't specify how fast the beer is to be chilled, I think the approach @Aedonis took is a very good one. If you're not up for a that much of a DIY project, there's a cheaper and easier solution that takes no tools:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For my fridge, I bought one of the little units like &lt;a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Hydro-Crunch-Temperature-Controller-Digital-Outlet-Heat-Mat-Thermostat-with-Heating-and-Cooling-Mode-D940010600/303421535?cm_mmc=Shopping%7CTHD%7Cgoogle%7C&amp;amp;mid=sHTMWfwGk%7Cdc_mtid_8903jx325196_pcrid_246417969542_pkw__pmt__product_303421535_slid_&amp;amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIxd24ofmN2wIVi24bCh1cMgy-EAYYByABEgLF0_D_BwE&amp;amp;dclid=CMuWla35jdsCFUdGXgod03AHsA" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;. It's cheap and simple. Plug the controller into the wall, plug the freezer into the controller, thread the sensor into the freezer on the hinge side of the door, and set the temperature. A used freezer plus $25 or so for a temperature controller, and you've got beer at the perfect temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One possible problem is that the internal temperature of a typical home fridge or freezer isn't very consistent. The bottles in the bottom back may freeze while the ones in the top front are too warm. A small fan, like the muffin fans they sell for electronics, will move the air around inside enough to keep it consistent, and they cost less than $20.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This really depends on the drink itself. Some wines are meant to keep for years. Others should be drunk immediately. Most should be drunk within 1 or 2 years. So choose your wine carefully. There are various vintage wine guides online.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, once you have chosen a wine meant for ageing, you do want a cellar (or if that is not available, a refrigerator designed for the purpose) that will be able to give you consistent:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Temperature: around 12-13 C (55 F)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Humidity: around 70 percent&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Light: keep wines out of sunlight or even bright lights&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And if the bottles have cork stoppers, they need to be stored on their side to prevent the cork drying out. This isn't an issue with screw tops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And that's pretty much it. If you don't have a cooler or cellar, keeping them in a cool, dark cupboard is still going to help...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I did a deep dive into Stack Exchange because I thought this question would've been asked before! But, it has not. That doesn't mean that the answer isn't super easy to find. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First of all, not all wines are meant to be aged. The vast majority of wines are meant to consume when you pick them up at the store. How can you tell which are which? Mainly on price (although not always the case). As the price point goes higher, these wines have been made with aging in mind and many times are unpalatable at a younger age. Red wines are meant to age longer because the tannins (the thing that gives red wine it's color) are an anti-oxidant. Some white wines like Riesling can age for decades. Champagnes can age for a long time, but because of their delicate nature and the cork and the whole CO2 pressure thing, they are harder to age. I've had some nicely aged Champagnes. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So basically, keep it in the dark and as close to freezing as possible. Some say that 55F is the best temperature, but actually the closer to freezing you get makes it keep longer. The problem is that for bottles with corks you should have a relatively high humidity so the corks don't dry out. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The myth that wines with screw caps don't age has been debunked by the Australian wine industry because the have mostly moved to screw caps and the wines age just fine if differently than bottles with corks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging_of_wine" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Aging of Wine&lt;/a&gt; from Wikipedia pretty much tells you the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I get beer to chill to the maximum possible?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is a recipe for getting your beer to a perfect temperature without breaking the bottles when a freezer in itself may too cold and a fridge may not be cold enough. The following method is relatively inexpensive.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Popping the beer in the fridge will take an hour to cool down. Even just sticking the beer in the freezer would take a good 20 minutes or so. This is just way too slow on a hot summer day. So, here’s how you can cool down a six pack in 3 minutes to the perfect drinkable temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You Need:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ul&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A six pack (bottles or cans)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bowl or pot large enough to fit the bodies of 6 bottles (preferably metal)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mixing Spoon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 trays of ice cubes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1-2 Cups Table Salt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Do It:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;1)Place bowl/pot in a sink.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;2)Add ice, salt, and enough water to fill up half of the bowl/pot.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;3)Stir until salt is dissolved.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;4)Add beers and make sure they are covered up to the neck with the icy water. You may need to add a bit more water.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;5)Place in the freezer (If you don’t, it may just take an extra minute or 2)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;6)After 3 minutes, pull the beers out. You should find that they are at the perfect temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How It Works:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The trick is in the salt. It may sound unusual considering that in winter, we drop salt on the ice to raise the temperature and make it melt, but in this case, the salt is tricked into cooling the beer. Since the salt does in fact melt the ice, it goes through a transition from a solid to liquid. When this occurs, it absorbs extra heat which keeps the water extra cold. In this case, the excess heat comes from the beers and the liquid more actively cools them. - &lt;a href="http://www.beerscenemag.com/2010/06/cool-a-beer-in-3-minutes/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Cool a Beer in 3 Minutes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is indeed the possibility that a bottle of frozen beer does not break.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It depends mainly on the amount of alcohol in the beer and how the bottle was filled.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can expect that a normal beer expands by approx. 6.5-7.5% in volume when you start cooling at approx. 20°C. If the bottleneck can contain this volume increase, the bottle should not break. This would be usually the case with homebrews. The exact amount depends on how much alcohol and solids are in the beer, as &lt;a href="http://ddbonline.ddbst.de/DIPPR105DensityCalculation/DIPPR105CalculationCGI.exe?component=Ethanol" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;ethanol&lt;/a&gt; does not expand when the temperature is lowered and solids do not change their density significantly. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Depending on the alcohol content and the temperature of the freezer, the beer might not even freeze solid, or at least not fully, as ethanol lowers the &lt;a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/will-liquor-freeze-760302" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;freezing point&lt;/a&gt; substantially.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With a bad freezer, high ambient temperature (e.g. on a hot summer day) or short freezing times, the possibility of breaking the bottles is rather low.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Because ice has a very low compressibility compared to water and ethanol, you cannot expect that better and thicker bottles will solve the problem unless they have the necessary amount of elasticity. You could weld your beer into 2 inch thick cast iron and it would break just like your glass bottle. A better container would, however, be less susceptible to leaks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A modern beer can would most likely not survive the process because it deforms at the top and creates a leak at the lid.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Refrigeration has little to do with preservation.  As a food product beer and NA beer are pretty strictly regulated for safety so as long as the rubber in the cap maintains a seal it should stay sterile.  Refrigeration is mostly for taste and carbonation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Storage temperature absolutely effects the quality of beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;High storage temperatures can produce Dimethyl Sulfide - a cooked corn/vegetable like favour.  Also high temperatures can cause the breakdown of yeast (autolyzation) contributing meaty/vegemite/marmite/miso like off flavours. 
					Ref: &lt;a href="https://www.beercartel.com.au/blog/beer-storage-the-dos-and-donts-of-storing-and-cellaring-beer/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.beercartel.com.au/blog/beer-storage-the-dos-and-donts-of-storing-and-cellaring-beer/&lt;/a&gt;
					(There are many other references if you search.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The storage time at the temperature is obviously also a factor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The changes also depend on the type of beer being stored.  If the beer is a pasteurised and/or completely filtered product, typically all yeast and suspended proteins have been removed.  Yeast can't autolyze if they have been removed.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hop-forward beers will lose their flavour, "hoppiness" much quicker if stored warm - even when stored properly, it's best to drink these beers sooner rather than cellar them.  I keep all my hoppy beers refrigerated at all times (handle them like dairy products).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a rule of thumb, cellar your beers around 10C / 50F without much variation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally, I only buy what I can keep in the refrigerator as a stable 10C is impossible where I live.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fluctuating temperatures cause oxygenation of your beverage&lt;/strong&gt;, but only over one or several years. This may spoil your beer, but not "skunk" it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have read that wine in wine cellars at around 14-16 degrees celsius last the longest, and that unstable and fluctuating temperatures over many years will spoil your wine by oxygenation. The same would apply for all alcoholic beverages. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Split it into small aluminum containers and store it in the fridge. Fill it to the top so there is very little air in the container.  You can find kid sized 12 oz water bottles on sell for just a few bucks.  It should last weeks but best used in one week.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is also suction pumps and nitrogen.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Temperature for drinking is personal taste.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It depends on what state you are in but here in Washington State the liquor control board wants you to document the destruction of alcoholic beverages that were damaged or expired if it's a large quantity. Usually this involves taking large amounts of beer or wine to dump or something and taking pictures of it as it's thrown away, dumped into a sewer or crushed. They don't want people giving away free alcohol without paying taxes. If it's a case of wine or a couple of six packs of beer, just throw them out and mark them up to losses.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think if it's expired or has problems, it usually goes back to the distributor who is tasked with disposing of it. Most alcoholic beverages don't have an expiration date so it usually goes into some mark down bin until it sells.&lt;/p&gt;

					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some breweries will by back beer that is past its freshness date (Sam Adams is well-known for this), while some will split the cost with the distributor.&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href="https://creativeloafing.com/content-195335-Beer--When-good-beer-goes-bad" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Beer - When good beer goes bad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have had beers that were quite fine well after there expiration date. And I have had beers that were simply horrible after the expiation date. Cooler temperatures will prolong the lifespan of most beers. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But how is expired beer typically disposed of by large retailers is a different matter?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;To avoid getting spoiled beer, check for a “brewed on” or “best by” date stamp, and avoid those that are not so labeled, especially if they have a fine layer of dust on them or visible sediment in the bottle (bottle-conditioned beers, however, are supposed to have a yeast sediment). Most pale ales, lagers and hefewiezens are best within three to six months of brewing. Darker beers and those with higher alcohol content might last a year. A few special beers are meant to be aged, but they are the exception rather than the rule. Beers stored in the cooler are less likely to spoil than those stored at room temperature, although many liquor stores stack case boxes on the floor, and those beers are less likely to be light-struck. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some breweries will by back beer that is past its freshness date (Sam Adams is well-known for this), while some will split the cost with the distributor.&lt;/strong&gt; In other cases, the retailer is left holding the bag for beer that did not move well. Still, liquor stores should not sell beer that has lost its quality. Let retailers know that a beer is expired or to return beers that you find to be stale (don’t do this just because you don’t like the beer — read some reviews of the beer and see what it is supposed to taste like). Check back in a few days and see how they have responded to your complaints.  If the expired beer is still on the shelf, let them know that you plan to shop elsewhere. - &lt;a href="https://creativeloafing.com/content-195335-Beer--When-good-beer-goes-bad" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Beer - When good beer goes bad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
