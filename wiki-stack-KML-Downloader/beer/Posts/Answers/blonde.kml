					&lt;p&gt;From experience the only way you will be able to know it to crack one open and give it a try you they will be safe to drink.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Of course if you try them and it tastes funny (e.g sour/bitter) or is not what expected in terms of carbonation (don't know what blond beer you are talking about to say) then just pour away there is no harm in giving it a try &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Overall the only way to see if it is ok is to pour one and give it a taste &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes it's safe to drink. There is nothing in there that wasn't in there already. If it was stored properly it should some signs of aging which can be a good thing if you are into that. The oldest beer I ever drank was a 9 year old doppelbock and it was still pretty darn good. I have had beers turn to malt vinegar after a few years. Just open it and taste it!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Most likely - Yes, it is safe to drink it.&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your beer is almost guaranteed to be safe to drink for humans. No pathogens like alcoholic beverages. If you have bacteria in your beer, you will just have another style of beer (see Sour Beer). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your beer could taste bad, but 1 year over expiration date is usually nothing serious. A lot depends on the type of beer + alcohol percentage + earlier exposure to oxygen + present bacteria in the beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When I brew Blondes, wheat beer or beers with belgian yeast, I'd rather have them condition in the bottle for several months before I drink them. Maybe your beer has become even better and more conditioned.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Good luck tasting!&lt;/p&gt;
