					&lt;p&gt;Yes.  Taste is really smell, and different glasses can capture aromas differently.  Furthermore, different aromas may be more or less present dependent upon temperature, and a glass may be crafted to be held a particular way (gathering more or less heat from your hand).  The same is true for wine glasses.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, how much of a difference it makes &lt;em&gt;to you&lt;/em&gt; is what's important.  Going back to the wine comparison, I can sometimes tell the difference between different glasses, but not consistently.  So it's not the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; important thing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Now that &lt;em&gt;that's&lt;/em&gt; said, there has been some informal, perhaps less than perfectly scientific studies, including a &lt;a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2012/06/beer-glasses-best-glass-for-craft-beer-taste-test.html"&gt;blind test&lt;/a&gt;.  Beer advocate provides some more &lt;a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/101/glassware/"&gt;detailed information&lt;/a&gt;.  Some of my local bars carry stemware for specific European beers, and I know of one stateside brewery, Black Shirt Brewing in Denver, which really wants you to &lt;a href="http://www.fermentedlychallenged.com/2012/06/black-shirt-brewing-to-feature-offero.html"&gt;stick your nose up in it&lt;/a&gt; (to good effect, in my experience).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer might be completely undrinkable if the water is poor quality. Usually it is ok to use your own tap water, but if it is softened, you'll want to buy bottled water, as the added sodium from the softener will ruin your beer. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I personally use purchased water from the grocery store. Usually 50% distilled, 50% "spring". Though honestly it's probably all tap water from somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most of beer is water, so it is vitally important.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here in Atlanta, we have some of the better tap water compared to many cities, but Monday Night Brewing in particular takes all minerals and chemicals out of the water and adds back in the appropriate properties to match the style of beer that they are trying to brew.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;They emulate the water from the origin of the beer style. Just consider that anything but the most pure form of water will impart some taste in your beer good or bad and is worth being aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Water is extremely important. When touring Brooklyn Brewery, the brewers went on and on about how great it is for them to have access to the NYC water supply.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;During brewing, the quality of the water is important because the minerals can affect a beer recipe greatly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would say that it has to do more with carbonation than anything else. Like soda, beer goes flat after a while and tastes bad (or not as good) when the carbonation is gone. Some beers have more carbonation than others, so I don't think you can accurately measure this, it really depends on the brew.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Oxidation (exposure to air) also may negatively impact the flavor. Of course, I wouldn't recommend exposing a beer to air for weeks and then drinking it due to various health concerns and I can't say I've ever tried it, nor do I want to.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a few components to the interaction between flavor and temperature, but one key one is simply that &lt;strong&gt;cold numbs your tongue&lt;/strong&gt;.  At least, extreme cold (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; "cold as the rockies").&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As such, overly cold beer will dull &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; strong flavor (hoppiness, bitterness, etc) and hide weaker ones.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In general, nitrogenation imparts a creamier, smoother texture to a beer. The bubbles are smaller in size than CO2 bubbles, and the reduced solubility results in a thicker beverage, which is both delicious, and results in that visually appealing 'cascade' effect. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, you can do &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/yNCaV3e9BEg"&gt;this with a Nitro beer. And that's awesome.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href="http://blog.khymos.org/2007/06/03/new-perspectives-on-whisky-and-water/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; which also cites &lt;a href="http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/%28SICI%291097-0010%2819990515%2979:7%3C1015%3a%3aAID-JSFA321%3E3.0.CO;2-R"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; discussing the chemical effects of cooling and dilution on whiskey.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The post concluded that the mix of dilution and cooling causes the alcohol to become soluble, which releases the flavour.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Ethanol becomes more soluble when whiskey is diluted and cooled, this promotes release of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;flavour molecules&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think this theory is applicable to beer, but with a few caveats; firstly, beer is already diluted and doesn't need any more water added; secondly, the alcohol content of beer is much lower than that of whiskey, so not as much cooling would be required.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the traditional way of serving beer. The keg is filled with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in order to push the beer into the tap. Since all beer contains CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, pressurizing the keg will maintain the natural carbonization of the beer as it is being served. The amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that the beer already has needs to be taken into account because nobody likes their beer too foamy or too flat.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Nitro dispensing is a newer method. In this case, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is used under high pressure either instead of or with the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It replaces some of the natural CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the beer, which results in a creamy flavor as well as a thick, tight foam on the top. Some beer "purists" regard the process as being unnatural because it really messes with the flavor of the beer. An example of a beer that uses Nitro is Guinness. When you open a can of Guinness, a nitrogen "ball" activates to carbonate the beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would avoid bread, since that contains quite a bit of salt and yeast - so if you taste yeast in the next beer you don't know if it's from the beer or from bread still stuck in your teeth. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The food should be neutral, preferably unsalted and consumed with water. Unsalted crackers are probably as close to ideal here. While cheese can work, I wouldn't say it neutralizes the palate, but softens it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not have any experiense on Beer testing but here are few tips from &lt;a href="http://beer.about.com/od/howtotastebeer/ht/HowToTasteBeer.htm"&gt;beer.about.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Do not taste new beers with food or soon after eating. The lingering flavors from food can greatly affect your impression of the brew.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Cleanse your palate with water. Crackers or cheese are fine but you should remember that even these foods can affect the apparent flavors of the beer.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;If you're tasting a number of different beers, let the color be your guide. It is best to taste from light to dark.&lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;More than a millenia ago, there were few standardized recipies for herbs to add during the beer brewing process.  "Gruit" referred to the herbal mixtures used to flavor and preserve beer.  Gruit was usually sold under papal license exclusive to certain areas at various monasteries and therefore represented a monopoly in Christian areas of the Catholic Church.  Traditionally it included plants such as yarrow, mugwort, henbane, sweet gale, bog rosemary, juniper, and more.  Some of these survive in gin recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Why gruit has largely been replaced by hops is a fascinating and divisive historical question.  There may however have been a number of factors including the possibility (largely untested) that hops beers kept longer and the rising concern by Protestant (and even Catholic) nobles of the power of the economic power that this gave Catholic institutions.  What is known is that a campaign was waged against gruit and the purported (and likely actual) mind altering properties of it.  The use of gruit was more or less entirely supplanted by hops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;More recently some breweries have been experimenting with gruit beers for national pride and/or historical reasons.  These include Fraoch and Alba from the Williams Brothers in Scotland, and a few other examples. They are not common however and are certainly specialty beers today.  Additionally the gruits used in commercial beers are pretty tame by historical standards.  I haven't found any including herbs like henbane (which was one of the historical staples of brewing, used even more prevalently than hops is today).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer is an alcoholic beverage produced by the saccharification of starch and fermentation of the resulting sugar. The starch and saccharification enzymes are often derived from malted cereal grains, most commonly malted barley and malted wheat.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It can be influinced and is often influenced during the brewing process, by adding sugar (which gets transformed into alcohol) at certain phases during the brewing process. Several beers first get brewn on a barrel and then after a few weeks put onto a bottle after which sugar may be added. Adding the sugar causes a seconds fermentation which will result in a higher alcohol level. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Often deeper tastes as experienced with for instance a La Trappe, Rocherfort 10 or Westvleteren are the effect of the higher alcohol level. While alcohol certainly plays a role in the beer's taste, spices and herbs are also important for the beer's taste body.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would argue that even having the IBUs on the bottle you still don't really know what you're going to get.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The bitterness of the beer isn't just down to the quantity of alpha acids, which is what the IBUs measure. The bitterness is offset by any residual sweetness in the beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A brewer can brew two different beers with the same IBUs, and them taste different. For example, with two beers with 20 IBUs - one might taste balanced between sweet and bitter, while the other one just tastes sweet. Another pair of beers with 70 IBUs, one might be unpleasantly bitter, while the other a more balanced kind bitter, or even simply neutral. The FG can give you some insight into these differences, but it's still not going to be precise.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Frankly the best way to know how the bitterness of the beer plays with the rest of the beer qualities is to read the label for any subjective descriptive text, or simply buy it and taste it. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you did want to measure it, you would need to use &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_measurement#cite_note-ASBC_Beer23-14" rel="nofollow"&gt;spectrophotometer and solvent extraction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://www.keykeg.com/en/" rel="nofollow"&gt;disposable kegs&lt;/a&gt;  that work the way you describe - with a inner pouch that is filled with beer and gas pressure is applied to the outside of that. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For draught systems that directly push the beer, there are these gasses in common use:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;air - such as with a hand-pump&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - homebrewers and short runs&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - for creamflow beers or where the beer line is longer than 50'.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;A mix of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Using air to push the beer doesn't have any immediate affect on taste. However, after a few hours the oxygen in the air will start to stale the beer, causing staling flavors, and a muted hop aroma. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Using CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to push the beer can cause the beer to have more "fizz" and in extreme cases more carbonic bite.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For long beer lines, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is used to overcome the carbonation problem with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A combination of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, typically in the ratio 75%/25% is used for Guinness and creamflow beers. When used in conjunction with a stout or creamer faucet, this has a definite affect on the flavor and appearance of the beer - bitterness is rounded out and the beer has a thicker mouthfeel. When the beer is poured, the faucet and gas pressure cascades of bubbles to form when poured in the glass, which produce a lovely thick dense head of foam on top of the glass. With this type of serving, it's key to have a relatively low amount of dissolved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or the glass will be filled with foam only.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Provided all the bottling equipment was properly sanitised (which you'd hope was the case for commercial beer), you shouldn't notice any impact on the taste of the beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, plastic bottles do not provide as good a seal as a crown sealed glass bottle.  If you store the beer for long enough (say six months to a year), a plastic bottle will have lost some of its carbonation.  If you stick to the "drink by" date on commercial beer though, this shouldn't be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are SO many different subcategories now. You can download the &lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/stylecenter.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;full judging guidelines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/compcenter.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;registration&lt;/a&gt; into the different styles.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Main categories include:  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Beer  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Mead  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Cider  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some of the sub-categories of beer include:  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;LIGHT LAGER  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;PILSNER  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;EUROPEAN AMBER LAGER  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;DARK LAGER  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;BOCK  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;LIGHT HYBRID BEER  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;AMBER HYBRID BEER  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;ENGLISH PALE ALE  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;SCOTTISH AND IRISH ALE  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;AMERICAN ALE  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;ENGLISH BROWN ALE  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;PORTER  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;STOUT  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;INDIA PALE ALE (IPA)  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;GERMAN WHEAT AND RYE BEER  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;BELGIAN AND FRENCH ALE  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;SOUR ALE  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;BELGIAN STRONG ALE  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;STRONG ALE  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;FRUIT BEER  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;SPICE / HERB / VEGETABLE BEER  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;SMOKE-FLAVORED AND WOOD-AGED BEER  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;SPECIALTY BEER  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think winning an award at any sanctioned competition would be huge. I do see the World Beer Awards, the US Open Beer Championships, Great American Beer Festival, and North American Beer Awards, just to name a few. There are also Homebrewing awards that are very competitive. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are some that claim this, such as the &lt;a href="http://www.worldbeercup.org/"&gt;World Beer Cup&lt;/a&gt; - but like this one, these are mostly US only, so the range of beers is very limited - as well as generally charging to enter.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.brewingawards.org/news.php?did=32"&gt;The International Brewing Awards&lt;/a&gt;, now in it's 128th year is probably the best known global competition, with a truly international line-up (although this year the cask ales category was dominated by the UK)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, most beer judging is based on how well the beer represents the style category that it is entered into. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These aspects of the beer are evaluated to see if they match with what is expected for the style:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;appearance: color / foam / clarity&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;aroma: malt / hop / yeast / esters&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;mouthfeel: body / carbonation&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;flavor: lots here - see below&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;aftertaste: flavors and aromas that persist after the beer is swallowed&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;overall impression: drinkability &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;All of these are evaluated with respect to what is expected for the style, and points assigned. The beer may be perfectly drinkable, but be marked down because it doesn't fit with the style. For example, a hefeweizen that is dark would be lose points for appearance since they are light-colored beers by style.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Judging sheets often have a list of flavor descriptors. Some flavors are bad for any beer, such as rubber, astringent, soapy, while others may or may not be considered faults depending upon style. For example, fruitiness in an English Ale is much desired, but not in a Pilsner, similarly low levels of diacetyl in a Stout is acceptable, but not in a Hefeweizen.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/docs/SCP_BeerScoreSheet.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;BJCP Scoresheet&lt;/a&gt; provides a working example of the notes a beer judge&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h3&gt;Flights!&lt;/h3&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I didn't know much about beers until I moved to San Diego, where I was introduced to beer flights:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9elD1.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Somehow, I'd never heard of or seen them!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A flight is 4 or 5 small servings of beer, typically in 4.5- to 5-oz. glasses, usually served on a "paddle." At least in San Diego, a flight costs as much as a pint on draught, so often it's a no-brainer to get flights if you want to taste a variety of beers. When you order a flight, you of course get to choose what 4 or 5 beers you'd like to have. I often select similar beers—a set of stouts and porters—or a bunch of IPAs (and doubles)—so I can really get a chance to taste what distinguishes specific brands and subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When a friend of mine flew in from New York (also never having heard of flights), he was enthusiastic about getting two flights and sharing all 10—doing blind tests on one another. He went from saying, before we got to the bar, "All beer tastes the same to me—I can only taste dark or light," to, "Oh man, I didn't know I was even capable of tasting such little differences!"&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, beer flights are an effective yet casual and fun way to get yourself or anyone to appreciate the multifarious tastes of beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think trying to start with all the ingredients, brewing processes, and the (dizzying) gamut of terminologies for all the subtle tastes, might be like teaching someone to drive by starting with the difference between torque and horsepower—they can't fully appreciate the meaning of words until they've &lt;em&gt;experienced&lt;/em&gt; the sensations they describe. By contrasting beers side-by-side, we build an &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt;, as-of-yet-wordless "vocabulary" of tastes, &lt;em&gt;e.g&lt;/em&gt; "This beer has more of... &lt;em&gt;that thing&lt;/em&gt;, whatever it's called, than this one," and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; we learn terminology (and ingredients and processes) as a means of filling those voids in words for senses we've experienced. Otherwise, we're storing abstract definitions, which we don't retain very well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In a word, practice. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most people drinking beer don't actually "taste" the beer properly. They just drink it. Of course, you do get some impression of the beer just from casual drinking, but it's not on the same level as if you are properly tasting it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, the first step to getting from the first quote to the second is learning how to taste the beer correctly and completely so that you can pick up all the nuances in the flavor and aroma. How to sample a beer properly? I think that's a good candidate for a new question!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oz_Clarke" rel="nofollow"&gt;Oz Clarke&lt;/a&gt;, you should burp the beer (to judge the hops).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;See this clip from Oz &amp;amp; James Drink to Britain (episode 1, starting at about 2:28):&lt;br&gt;

					&lt;h3&gt;Take Tasting Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's easy to "just drink it".  If you want to really pay attention to the beer, there's nothing better than forcing yourself to write it down.  The format doesn't matter much, but I prefer a multi-part tasting form to force me to think about each part of the beer.  For example, I usually break it down into 4 sections:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Appearance: How much head?  How long did the head last?  What color was it?  What color is the beer itself?&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Aroma: What do you smell?  How strong is the smell?&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Taste: What do you taste?  How does that compare what you smelled?  How's the aftertaste?&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Mouthfeel: Usually just watery, oily, or creamy.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Tasting notes like this force you to really concentrate on the taste, which helps improve your palate.  They're also nice because you now have a record of your thoughts on that beer to refer to later (maybe to compare to other beers of that style).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/101/taste/"&gt;Beer Advocate's Guide&lt;/a&gt; is a decent one.  The abridged version is:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Look at the beer.  How's the color and head?&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Swirl it a little bit to pull out the aroma&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Smell it.  Swirl again if need be.  I recommend taking a 20 second break after smelling, then smelling again, since if you smell too long, your nose gets used to it and it becomes harder to pick up the notes.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Sip it.  Don't swallow immediately, but keep it on your tongue for a moment.  Breath out with it still in your mouth and pay attention to the resulting smell (unless you just ate a bunch of garlic before the beer).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Taste again as the beer warms up a bit.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In short, prepare for a hangover. They pack a strong amount of alcohol (6-9% ABV), but you won't really taste it much. You're gonna get a lot of malt flavor, they're not very hoppy beers. So expect some sweet, fruity flavors. I'd recommend you give Allagash Dubbel Ale a try. It's a bit pricey (at like $12 for a 4-pack), but it's well worth it. I've never been disappointed by any beer from Allagash.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Now If you're curious, a Tripel is like a double, but they use three times the amount of malt than a standard Trappist "single", hence the name. So expect flavors similar to that of the dubbel, but much more pronounced. They are also higher in alcohol than a dubbel (9-12% ABV). For this style, my personal favorite, as of now (I've only had two of them) is Weyerbacher Brewing Co's Merry Monks Ale. The other one was the Allagash Tripel, which was also outstanding, but I'm partial to the Monks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As with any style, there's a fair deal of variation from one brewery to another.  At a high level, though, you can expect them to be darker (although not stout-dark), rich, and malty.  Expect a complex taste, with many notes and flavors.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;More specifically, the BJCP have this to say (abridged):&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aroma&lt;/strong&gt;: malty sweetness, hints of caramel or chocolate, and moderate fruity esters.  Some will have a little spice to them.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appearance&lt;/strong&gt;:  Dark amber to copper in color, Large, dense head.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taste&lt;/strong&gt;: Same as aroma. Alcohol flavor, if any, should be mild and not solvent-y.  No or minimal hop flavor.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mouthfeel&lt;/strong&gt;: Medium-full body. Medium-high carbonation.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.homebrewtalk.com/wiki/index.php/Belgian_Dubbel#Competition_Styles"&gt;See here&lt;/a&gt; for the full description.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If your dishwasher uses a rinsing/drying agent (Finish/Jet Dry type product), these products contain surfactants, which serve to reduce surface tension and "flatten" the water molecules for faster drying.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would imagine that any residual surfactants on the glass reduce the surface tension of the carbon dioxide bubbles and cause them to pop, reducing the amount of head on the beer.  Since these products tend to brag that they remain on the dishes after washing to give them a "sheen" I imagine there is quite a bit of residue.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Washing your glasses by hand is probably the best approach to avoid this.  While most dishwashing liquids also contain a lot of surfactants, they are designed to be rinsed away easily.  I suppose you could empty your dishwasher of rinse aid, but I don't know how other dishes would come out.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="http://www.dishwashingexpert.com/dishwashing-basics/dishwashing-science"&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; for some of the details.  I think it's run by one of the manufacturers of the rinse aid products, so take it with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another problem could be that dishwasher procedures could permanently change physical properties of the glass surface. The changes could be:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;mineral deposits&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;etching and corrosion&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;devitrification (crystallization of the amorphous glass)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dishwasher#Hazing_of_glassware"&gt;hazing of glassware&lt;/a&gt; on Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The physically changed surface would usually create &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleation"&gt;nucleation&lt;/a&gt; points for collecting of the released carbon dioxide to form bubbles. See also &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget_%28beer%29#Beer_glass_widget"&gt;beer glass widget&lt;/a&gt;. This could cause faster release of carbon dioxide from the beer and a subsequent change of the taste of the beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would like to point out that taste is not the only important criterion when drinking beer. What you want is a good &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt;, and the taste is only a part (albeit a major part) of that.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Having different glasses for different types of beers can affect your drinking experience in a number of different ways. First off, having an unusual or unique glass can often be very fun, because it's probably not something you're used to. The first time I ever drank beer from a litre mug was a very fun experience for me, and not because it made the beer taste differently. Secondly, I find that different types of glasses encourage me to enjoy the beer in different ways. I find that glasses with stems, which are often used for stronger beers, encourage me to drink the beer more slowly and savor it a bit more than a glass without a stem. I think these effects on experience are one of the big reasons for the wide variations in beer glassware. As a beer manufacturer, if I could make a unique glass that will better help people remember my beer, I would consider that a worthwhile investment.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm not trying to say that the effects of glassware on taste don't exist or are unimportant; I think they are important. But they're only part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When cleaning a beer glass your goal is to remove everything you can from the surface.  As the other answers mention, washing with dish detergent tends to leave an unpleasant film.  It's not hard to keep your glassware clean:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't use beer glasses for other drinks&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly drinks with fat (like milk) since glassware cleaner isn't designed to remove it.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always rinse your glasses immediately&lt;/strong&gt;: your job's much harder if the lacing and sediment dries caked on the glass.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hand wash your glassware&lt;/strong&gt;, not only because of the detergent, but also because the best glasses are made of the thinnest glass, so they're quite delicate.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use a beer-specific cleaning agent&lt;/strong&gt;, a percarbonate cleaner like PBW, One-Step or B-Brite.  These are formulated specifically to deal with the compounds that beer leaves in a glass.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you only ever drink beer out of your beer glasses and always rinse them soon after, you'll find that you can wash with a pretty weak cleaning solution.  I almost never need more than about 1/2 ounce of PBW in a gallon of hot water.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also see &lt;a href="http://www.howtobrew.com/section1/chapter2-2-1.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;How to Brew&lt;/a&gt;'s section on cleaning products.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As long the beer's sealed, there should be no difference in taste due to rapid or slow cooling. Lowering the temperature only increases the solubility of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which should dissolve later.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Temperature itself does impact taste, supposedly due to our taste buds being number in cold, hiding certain flavors (which can be desirable or undesirable depending on the beer). But this isn't related to the rate of cooling of beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I can think of three possible impacts this scheme might have on a keg of beer.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Since the keg is kept at room temperature, if the beer is unpasteurized the flavor will evolve at a faster rate than refrigerated beer would.  This isn't a change due to the quick cooling, per se, but it is a possibly major difference.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;As mentioned by @acheong, the CO2 solubility of beer is significantly lower at room temperature, so keeping the beer properly carbonated becomes a more difficult task.  Specifically, you have to keep the pressure much higher, making the serving pressure higher, which makes the complex calculus of draft line measurements that much harder.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Chill haze could be an issue.  If the brewer didn't take steps to prevent it, there'll be haze-inducing proteins in suspension.  If the beer is stored cool, these will quickly fall out, but if it's kept warm and only cooled at the time it's served, they'll end up in your glass.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In short, no.  The time it takes to cool a beer will not have an impact on the flavor of a beer.  However there are certain temperatures that are preferred for serving certain beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The most damaging thing to beer flavor is light pollution.  When in direct light, isohumulones from the bittering agents in hops can react with riboflavin (Vitamin B2) in beer and produce 3-methylbut-2-ene-1-thiol (MBT) which has a noticeable skunky flavor and aroma.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There may be a general consensus for the "proper" serving temperature, which could involve questions like "what do &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; people seem to like?", and "what temperature does the brewer feel best accentuates the parts of the beer they want to highlight?".  So there are good reasons for beer to be served at particular temperatures.  In the case of your British bitters, age-old recipes were probably designed to allow the beer to taste its best at room temperature.  As for a modern British beer, I suppose that would depend on what the brewer had in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, my general thought is that you should drink a beer at the temperature you most like it, so the &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; part of your question is self-determined, and don't let anyone tell you that your taste buds are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Myself, I tend to like my American IPAs cooler than the typical recommended serving temperature.  And before I visited the UK, I couldn't stand a room temperature beer.  Then, after a week in Tunbridge Wells, I picked up a large appreciation for hand-pumped UK beer, served at room temp.  So you should open yourself to trying new things as well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Serving temperature is, of course, a preference.  Serve it frozen or boiling if you want.  However, a few opinions are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.camra.org.uk/beerinthepub" rel="nofollow"&gt;CAMRA says&lt;/a&gt; that Real Ale (aka cask ale, usually english-style) should be served at 12-14 °C (54-57 °F), which is colder than room temperature, but warmer than your usually keg beer.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/Story.asp?StoryID=479" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ratebeer says&lt;/a&gt; the same thing regardless of whether it’s cask or not.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/style/98/" rel="nofollow"&gt;BeerAdvocate says&lt;/a&gt; 7-10 °C (45-50 °F) for an english bitter.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, if you’re looking for a rule of thumb: “cool but not super-cold” or “cellar temp” will probably get you close enough.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, let's say there is what is considered "proper", and then there is personal-preference. To be a good Cicerone, know what is "proper" but also show tolerance for personal preference.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With that out the way, it's definitely considered the "proper" thing to do to serve English beers warmer than ice-cold. Many of the delicate malty flavours you get from English malt, the fruitiness from esters produced by the English yeast, plus grassy, herbal or floral tones from the hops are muted greatly when the beer is served too cold. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some people say it's served at room room temperature. Modern room temperature of around 20&amp;deg;C/68&amp;deg;F is too warm. The ideal serving temperature is a cold cellar - typically around 12&amp;deg;C;55&amp;deg;F. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Just like everyone else said, it's a preference. I alway say that the darker the beer, the warmer it has to be, so here are my rules:&lt;br&gt;
					- &lt;strong&gt;Light beer/White beer/Kriek&lt;/strong&gt;: In the fridge and goes in the freezer for a couple of minutes before serving&lt;br&gt;
					- &lt;strong&gt;Golden beer&lt;/strong&gt;: In the fridge&lt;br&gt;
					- &lt;strong&gt;Amber beer&lt;/strong&gt;: In the fridge and stay at room temperature for a couple of minutes before serving&lt;br&gt;
					- &lt;strong&gt;Dark beer&lt;/strong&gt;: At room temperature and goes in the fridge before serving&lt;br&gt;
					- &lt;strong&gt;Stout&lt;/strong&gt;: At room temperature at all time.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;OG stands for "original gravity", which is the &lt;em&gt;density&lt;/em&gt; of the liquid, before fermentation in the case of beer.  Another "gravity" you may hear is "final gravity", or FG: the density of the beer &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; fermentation.  Typically, gravity is expressed as thousandths over 1.0, where 1.0 is water.  However, Gnarly Oak says that their Winter Bock has an OG of 15, which is likely in degrees Plato.  I leave it to other answers to thoroughly explain what that is.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The density, of course, is increased by the sugar and other "good stuff" that makes beer, well, beer.  After the yeast has eaten the sugar and produced alcohol, you can measure the final gravity.  What makes this interesting is that if you have the OG and the FG, you can calculate your alcohol by volume with a &lt;a href="http://wiki.homebrewersassociation.org/specificgravitymeasurements" rel="nofollow"&gt;little math&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am completely unfamiliar with RDF, however.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'll answer one half and leave the other half to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;OG is “Original Gravity”&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Specific Gravity (often shorted to just ‘gravity’) is a measure of the density of a liquid.  Since its is mostly water, you can compare beer’s density to water to find out how much other stuff is in it.  Water has a gravity of 1.000, and beers will often have an original gravity of 1.200 to 1.020.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;“Original Gravity” is the density of beer before it’s fermented (when it’s called ‘wort’), and “Final Gravity” is the density after it’s fermented.  You can determine the alcohol content of a beer by comparing the two gravities and inferring how much fermentable “stuff” disappeared during fermentation (i.e., was converted to alcohol and CO2).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In commercial beer, you can use OG as a shorthand for how “Big” the beer is because it indicates how much malt and other fermentable stuff was in it.  So a lighter-flavored beer like a blonde or a pilnser will often have a low original gravity (1.020 to 1.050, for example), whereas a big stout or barelywine might have a higher original gravity (1.080 up to as much as 1.200).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;OG is in important measurement for home brewers, so another use of it on a commercial beer is to help people produce clones of said beer at home by reproducing the OG (among other factors).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h3&gt;Definition&lt;/h3&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To get a little more technical, Specific Gravity is the ratio of the density of one liquid to another.  In brewing, we always use water.  So, the density of water divided by the density of water is 1.000.  The density of beer divided by the density of water is what we refer to as ‘gravity’ when discussing beer.  And since it’s a ratio of two identical measures, there are no units.  It’s not 1.000 somethings; it’s just 1.000.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h3&gt;Plato&lt;/h3&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Homebrewers often use "brewer's points" (eg 1.123), but you'll sometimes see the "Plato Scale", which is more popular in central Europe.  A good approximation is that 1˚ plato = 4 brewer's points.  So 12˚ Plato corresponds to a gravity of 1.048.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From the figures you posted,&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;OG - "Original Gravity". When measured with a hydrometer, it measures the density relative to water. E.g. 1.010 is 1% heavier than water. The units here are &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_measurement#Strength" rel="nofollow"&gt;degrees Plato&lt;/a&gt; (&amp;deg;P), which describe the amount of dissolved sugars. Here, 15 means 15% dissolved sugar. This means the beer (or more correctly, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wort" rel="nofollow"&gt;wort&lt;/a&gt;) contained 15% sugar before fermentation started.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;RDF - The real degree of fermentation. This is in contrast to the Apparent Degree of Fermentation, which is (OG-FG)/OG. When the final gravity is measured using hydrometer, the alcohol in the beer, being less dense than water (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol" rel="nofollow"&gt;SG. 0.789&lt;/a&gt;) causes the gravity to appear lower, so it looks as though the yeast has fermented more sugar than it actually has. The Real degree of Fermentation takes the alcohol into account and computes the actual amount of sugars fermented. This tells you the how much of the original sugar was fermented (as a percentage). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, what does this mean in practice?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Winter Bock - 15 OG, 62.5 RDF - light, tasty, ever so slightly bitter&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This has an average RDF for a beer that size, so it will be somewhat malty, but not cloying.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Hazelnut Dark - 15 OG, 60.4 RDF - nice bitter red with slightly sweet aftertaste&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This has more dissolved sugars in it compared to the Bock, so you'd expect it to be a thicker mouthfeel and slightly more sweet, although you may not taste the sweetness if it's offset by roasted malts.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Chocolate Stout - 14.8 OG, 66.8 RDF - very sweet with hints of chocolate and malt&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Being the driest of all the beers, yet the taste description is given as very sweet. This shows that knowing the residual sugars doesn't tell you the sweetness, simply because there are different kinds of residual sugar. For example, dextrins create body, but have relatively little taste, so would taste not as sweet as a beer containing a lot of residual maltose or glucose. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You want to have enough beer so that a person would be able to see the head profile along with getting a good look at the color/clarity of the beer.  Along with being able to take 2 - 3 sips of the beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A tasting would be a larger pour as this would be more of a friendly gathering and you want the people to enjoy the beer, I would aim for 4 - 6 oz.  It is also not too much if they don't like it.  For a tasting, you don't really care if people are getting drunk.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For a competition since you are not aiming to really "drink" the beer, I would say that it would probably be 2 - 3 oz.  Judges are going to aim to not get drunk on the beer, so the smaller pour helps with that.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are two angles to consider &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;what is best for the beer&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;what is best for the tasting scenario&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For the beer, a serving size that is appropriate should:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;provide sufficient beer to not warm up excessively in the cup or glass in the minute or two tasting is underway. This means serving sizes should be at least 60ml/2 oz. (If the beer is served too cold, leave it in the bottle to warm, so that all samples are poured together and tasted at the same temperature.)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For the tasting situation we have to consider:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may be a limited amount of an evaluation beer to share between the number of judges so serving sizes should be restrained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, some additional beer should be left over in case a re-evaluation is necessary. This is particularly important with styles where volatiles are a key contributor, since they dissipate quickly, plus the olfactory sense quickly becomes tired, requiring a pause and then a fresh sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Taking these two into account gives a typical serving size in the order of 3-4oz/75-100ml.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Note that the glass can be larger - particularly a long tall glass is good for capturing the aromatics of a smaller sample.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;No.  While in a wine tasting it's acceptable to spit out the wine, in beer tasting you actually have to drink the beer.  I don't remember the exact reasoning since it's been a few years since my Beers of the World class, but I think it had something to do with the carbonation affecting the after taste if you don't swallow the beer.  Keep in mind that while judging beers at a tasting you only get ~2 ounces, so it's easier to pace yourself and dump out anything past what you need to get your impression.  Half of beer judge training is learning to quickly assess flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as I've seen, no. The reason has nothing to do with alcohol content or getting drunk (some beers like Belgian tripels, imperial stouts, or barley wines can easily clock in at a higher ABV than wines). It's got more to do with the human tongue itself and how taste buds are organized on the tongue. Essentially, beer is a much more complex drink; beer tasters use all of their taste buds while wine drinkers may only use a select few. So when you drink beer, you're not going to be overwhelming any set of taste buds unevenly while you run that risk when drinking wine.  Generally when drinking wine, you're only using your sweet and sour sets of taste buds. For instance, I don't know about you, but I've never really had a bitter wine. I've had sweet or sour wines, but never bitter or salty wines. On the other hand, I've had all of that with beer. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you look at the diagram of the tongue below, you'll notice that the bitter taste bud receptors are on the back of the tongue. In order to reach these receptors and taste the beer to its fullest, you must swallow the beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UhXle.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're curious, see page 3-4 of this article. It goes into much more detail:
					&lt;a href="http://www.gabc-boston.org/_Newsl/2012_11.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://www.gabc-boston.org/_Newsl/2012_11.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not generally.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The aftertaste of beer is more important than it is in wine, and much of the aftertaste comes from swallowing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, beer isn't generally as alcoholic as wine, so the risk of getting drunk on a taste is lower.  Although some beers can be in the 10-12% range, the average abv is much lower.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Further, although the idea of a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue_map"&gt;tongue map&lt;/a&gt; has been relatively discredited in scientific circles, it was taught in schools for a long time.  As such, many people (including beer judges) incorrectly believe you taste bitterness with the back of your tongue.  Since bitterness is a much larger part of beer than wine, many believe you need to swallow to properly taste it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To my knowledge, the answer is always &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To fully experience the flavor of beer, one must swallow it. This is because, unlike the vast majority of wine, beer is carbonated (albeit to varying degrees). When you swallow beer, some of the carbonation escapes the liquid as gas, and actually rises up from your throat into your nose (or, at least, into your nasal passages), carrying with it some of the flavor molecules of the beer. Thus your sense of smell combines with your sense of taste to produce an overall sense of flavor in a manner that is different from what occurs when you drink (uncarbonated) wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you spit out your beer, you're ruining the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;(This explanation is based on one that I heard years ago from a brewmaster at Anheuser-Busch. I can't remember his exact words, but you get the gist.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;On a side note, regarding the important relationship between taste and smell, I'm sure you will see tasters at both beer tastings and especially wine tastings swirl their drink a bit to smell it from the glass before tasting it. The difference is that carbonated beverages pack a smell double-whammy coming at you after you swallow.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Quite the opposite, bottle conditioned beer is perfect for aging. The yeast carbonates the beer and will produce slight changes over time, like upping the ABV. This needs to be done in climate controlled environments similar to wine. The yeast will settle to bottom and you want to avoid pouring this into your glass when finished. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I brewed a Imperial honey stout and aged a few bottles at 68f for about a year for my birthday. The beer started at about 7.2 ABV The beer finished at over 9 ABV (this is because the yeast had plenty of starch to munch on and the carbonation was not affected. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In addition to Waitkus his answer I would like to note that the perfect time to drink a beer depends on the type, brand and most importantly taste. There is also a difference when storing larger bottles. For instance a 75 cl Duvel bottle (or larger) can be stored easily for several years, whereas the smaller bottles of the same beer don't fair too well. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Other beers, mostly heavier abbey beers allow for prolonged storing. For instance an Orval changes taste quite drastically once you have stored it for about 1 - 2 years. I've even seen these beers being stored for 30 years and still being drinkable (although you needed to pour it very carefully as there was a lot of cediment). The monks of Westmalle even have 35 year old beer on site for their own consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In regards to taste, they tend to become heavier, stronger in taste, sometimes a bit more sour. They also loose a bit of their carbonation (very old beers).  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Bottle conditioned beers definitely have longer shelf-lives than their pasteurized/filtered counterparts - the yeast helps scavenge oxygen and release sulphites to stop free radicals (such as from lipid breakdown) from staling the beer. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The yeast can survive for decades - Guinness &lt;a href="http://zythophile.wordpress.com/2011/03/18/bottle-ageing-beers-the-donts-and-dos/" rel="nofollow"&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt; yeast still alive in the bottle after 35 years!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;How long a bottle conditioned beer can be aged for and, thus how soon you should drink, comes mainly down to &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;the alcohol percentage - stronger beers age better, and&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;the color - darker beers age better than lighter ones&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While a light beer may be best consumed within 5 years, darker beers can be aged much longer than that. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;See&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://zythophile.wordpress.com/2011/03/18/bottle-ageing-beers-the-donts-and-dos/" rel="nofollow"&gt;bottle aging beers - do's and don'ts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1603420894" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tasting Beer&lt;/a&gt; by Randy Mosher is by far the most valuable beer book I've ever read.  It covers the styles you'll encounter, the flavors, the technology, the history, the science, and more.  I was a fairly knowledgeable beer enthusiast when I read it, but I wish I'd read it ten years earlier.  If I had, it would have increased my enjoyment of getting to know beer ten-fold by increasing my  understanding of what I was drinking.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Spitoon? No. Bucket for dumping the remainder? Yes. I agree with the other posters, with the addition that in the ONE competition I've judged in as a Novice, as Sloleam points out, we typically did not finish the 2-3 oz or so that was poured, and the remainder was dumped in a bucket. According to the &lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/docs/How_to_Judge_Beer.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;BJCP guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, you sniff it, look at it, taste it (allowing it to linger before swallowing). That's it. After that, you typically dump the rest in a bucket, especially if you are going to be judging several categories :)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I expect a high alcohol beer, with a lot of complex flavors.  One that the alcohol content will "sneak" up on you because it isn't very obvious in the taste.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Quoting from the &lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style18.php#1c"&gt;Beer Judge Criteria&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Aroma: Complex with moderate to significant spiciness, moderate
					  fruity esters and low alcohol and hop aromas. Generous spicy, peppery,
					  sometimes clove-like phenols. Esters are often reminiscent of citrus
					  fruits such as oranges, but may sometimes have a slight banana
					  character. A low yet distinctive spicy, floral, sometimes perfumy hop
					  character is usually found. Alcohols are soft, spicy and low in
					  intensity. No hot alcohol or solventy aromas. The malt character is
					  light. No diacetyl.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Appearance: Deep yellow to deep gold in color. Good clarity.
					  Effervescent. Long-lasting, creamy, rocky, white head resulting in
					  characteristic “Belgian lace” on the glass as it fades.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Flavor: Marriage of spicy, fruity and alcohol flavors supported by a
					  soft malt character. Low to moderate phenols are peppery in character.
					  Esters are reminiscent of citrus fruit such as orange or sometimes
					  lemon. A low to moderate spicy hop character is usually found.
					  Alcohols are soft, spicy, often a bit sweet and low in intensity.
					  Bitterness is typically medium to high from a combination of hop
					  bitterness and yeast-produced phenolics. Substantial carbonation and
					  bitterness lends a dry finish with a moderately bitter aftertaste. No
					  diacetyl.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body, although lighter than the
					  substantial gravity would suggest (thanks to sugar and high
					  carbonation). High alcohol content adds a pleasant creaminess but
					  little to no obvious warming sensation. No hot alcohol or solventy
					  character. Always effervescent. Never astringent.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Overall Impression: Strongly resembles a Strong Golden Ale but
					  slightly darker and somewhat fuller-bodied. Usually has a more rounded
					  malt flavor but should not be sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Comments: High in alcohol but does not taste strongly of alcohol. The
					  best examples are sneaky, not obvious. High carbonation and
					  attenuation helps to bring out the many flavors and to increase the
					  perception of a dry finish. Most Trappist versions have at least 30
					  IBUs and are very dry. Traditionally bottle-conditioned (“refermented
					  in the bottle”).&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;History: Originally popularized by the Trappist monastery at
					  Westmalle.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Ingredients: The light color and relatively light body for a beer of
					  this strength are the result of using Pilsner malt and up to 20% white
					  sugar. Noble hops or Styrian Goldings are commonly used. Belgian yeast
					  strains are used – those that produce fruity esters, spicy phenolics
					  and higher alcohols – often aided by slightly warmer fermentation
					  temperatures. Spice additions are generally not traditional, and if
					  used, should not be recognizable as such. Fairly soft water.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, to clear up the myth.   European beer is not served warm.  Some beers, such as real ale (or cask ale) are served at cellar temperature, which while certainly above the temperature of a beer fresh out a refrigerator, at 12-14 degrees celsius (53-57F) is still much colder than room temperature.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To answer your question:&lt;/strong&gt;  Mulled beer &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; heated beer.  As with wine, mulled beer is usually warmed over a low stove or in a crockpot with spices, often including cinnamon, nutmeg, citrus zest, and a sweetener like brown sugar, but it doesn't &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to include any additional ingredients, particularly if it already has strong spice or fruit characteristics.  So, any beer style that you heat is, in fact, mulled beer.     &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As to styles of beer that would be suitable for mulling, Belgian Strong Dark ales would be good candidates, as would nice fruity lambics.   Barleywine ales, milk stouts, chocolate stouts, and oatmeal stouts I would imagine might also be nice.  The characteristics I'd look for would be a heavy body, more malty than hoppy, a bit of sweetness, and if present, dark fruit (plumbs, figs, raisins) or berries.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am a big fan of tripels and quadrupels.  They are dark, and much smoother, I find, than blondes and other lower-alcohol beers (and yes, tripels are substantially more alcoholic).  Contrary to the previous answer, I find they taste less bitter than typical beers, although perhaps it may be because the bitterness is masked by the other flavors perhaps?  It may depend, though; Chimay yellow label has a note of bitterness that I don't find in, say, a Westmalle.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Part of it depends on what you're used to.  If you're used to mass-market beers you will find these very different.  Heavier and more substantial.  Richer, more luxurious.  Very much not something you quaff down a few at a time to quench your thirst; these are savored.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are also quadrupels, such as the Roquefort 10 or Westvleteren XII, which are even better in my mind. These are very dark and pack an alcoholic punch.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Cask beers have very low levels of carbonation, enough that one could almost consider them to be flat. This is due to the fact that they aren't served under any pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What you're most likely to find everyday are not beers that are flat, exactly, but are very low in carbonation.   Barleywine ale is one of these styles, and though it will typically have some carbonation, it will be very little.  In the UK, real (or cask) ale is another style with very little carbonation.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The only style I can think of off the top of my head that is really and truly uncarbonated are the super high alcohol beers like Boston Beer's Samuel Adams Utopias and some of the various high-alcohol freeze-distilled* varieties.  To me, these styles have nearly as much in common with fortified wine or spirits as they do with beer, and they're not easy to find, so they're a bit of an outlier.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Distillation requires heat, so the process of freezing to concentrate alcohol in a beer isn't really technically distillation, but hey, that's what it's called, so when it Rome...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Historically beer was almost definitely still (flat) for thousands of years. Before the discovery/invention of force carbonation methods, all beer was carbonated naturally via bottle or cask conditioning. But people were brewing alcoholic beverages commonly referred to as beer in antiquity, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Edward_McGovern#Investigations_of_ancient_dyes.2C_foods.2C_beverages.2C_and_other_organics" rel="noreferrer"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; from these cultures (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiahu" rel="noreferrer"&gt;ancient China&lt;/a&gt;, Neolithic culture, etc) suggests that they were doing this in big stone and earthenware pots and jugs, which may have had no lids or loose lids. Their vessels probably could not have withstood the pressure of carbonation even if they were using wax or cork to seal the vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So if you were to brew a historical style and you wanted to be truly accurate, then you would not carbonate it. But the modern historical interpretations usually are carbonated (like &lt;a href="http://www.dogfish.com/ancientales" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Dogfish Head's ancient ales&lt;/a&gt;), because they are selling them and Westerners generally prefer them :)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is one "modern style" (e.g. &lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/catdex.php" rel="noreferrer"&gt;a style you'd find in the BJCP style guide&lt;/a&gt;), that can be served with &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gYVLHMmplRcC&amp;amp;pg=PA221&amp;amp;lpg=PA221&amp;amp;dq=oxford%20beer%20companion%20carbonation&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=MGgbsp_cV7&amp;amp;sig=34ClGqwJYwLtNhACLrhsw7Ot8Zc&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=itX_Ut-2PKPWyQG5m4DQDw&amp;amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=oxford%20beer%20companion%20carbonation&amp;amp;f=false" rel="noreferrer"&gt;no carbonation&lt;/a&gt;, namely &lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style17.php#1d" rel="noreferrer"&gt;straight (unblended) lambic&lt;/a&gt;. Several have little or low carbonation, (e.g. barleywine) mentioned in other answers. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahti" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Sahti&lt;/a&gt; also has very little carbonation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But people do still drink flat/still beer all over the world, for example there's some uncarbonated corn beers that are popular, like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicha" rel="noreferrer"&gt;chicha&lt;/a&gt; in Latin America (&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/dining/09beer.html?pagewanted=1&amp;amp;_r=1&amp;amp;sq=dogfish&amp;amp;st=cse&amp;amp;scp=1" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Dogfish Head made a Chicha inspired beer&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umqombothi" rel="noreferrer"&gt;umqombothi&lt;/a&gt; in South Africa. There are other names for similar beers in other regions. These are typically homebrewed.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A Belgian Double is an amber/brown beer of usually 6-7.5% ABV (They can drift higher).  The style was most likely originated at Westmalle in the mid 19th Century.  While Trappist abbeys tend to be the origin and driver of the style, many secular Belgian breweries produce them as Abbey beers which may have actually been a brewing monastery at one point or simply as a Dubbel.  They're not as popular amongst American brewers as triples though.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as flavor profile, it's a malty but dry beer.  The Belgian abbey yeast strains will ferment the beer fairly dry but will create a whole host of fruity esters and spicy phenols that will add to the mid range caramel malts.  Many of the Trappist versions have attenuation of 80%-90%.  Westmalle Dubbel, Chimay Red Label, New Belgium Abbey, St. Martin Brune are all good examples of the style.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With regards to AudiFanatic's answer, In this case, Beer Advocate is wrong in their description of a Triple. Triples do NOT use 3x's the malt as a Single.  No brewer will tell you that, nor is it true historically.  Malt extraction is linear, meaning 3x's the malt will be 3x's the alcohol.  The closest you get to that is historically when the single was the 3rd running (like a small beer). With this method, the 1st run had triple the fermentables extracted than the 3rd run.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And while I may only be a blogger, with 13 years of industry experience, I spoke with highly trained brewmasters and read references written by authoritative experts.  I'm pretty sure my answer article is more accurate than the Beer Advocate's, in this case.  Also, the flavor profile of a triple does not have "flavors similar" to a dubbel.  Dark malt and light malt will give very different flavors. The only Triple that has similar flavor is Stift Engelzell's triple, which is a unique dark triple, as they're labeling it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As stated above, if you want to know about a certain style the &lt;a href="http://bjcp.org/2008styles/catdex.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;BJCP guidelines&lt;/a&gt; are a great place to start.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not all styles are reflected in the BJCP guidelines though.  For instance, the BJCP doesn't recognize Black IPAs, or American Wild Ales.  The &lt;a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/style" rel="nofollow"&gt;Beer Advocate style guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, and the guidelines from the &lt;a href="http://www.greatamericanbeerfestival.com/the-competition/beer-styles/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Great American Beer Festival&lt;/a&gt; might also be useful to you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With regard to your specific question about Tripels, you can read my own thoughts about them on my blog (I'm trying to drink all the BJCP styles are write about them):&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, let me state that I'm a 4th generation Italian American; I know nothing about Russian customs other than what I learned in a Russian history class (humanities requirement) a few semesters ago. With that said, I could probably shoot an email to the professor who I took the class with if you want more info, but I think my answer will suffice (but please let me know, he is a pretty cool guy).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I would presume it has something to do with Russian culture and the importance of honey in that part of the world. I remember when I was a kid (like 2nd  grade I think), we read a collection of short, non-fiction stories of a Russian girl and her grandfather, who was a beekeeper. I cannot remember what the name of the book was nor the author nor whether or not the stories took before or during the Soviet era; but I do remember that honey played a really important role in most of the stories.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Of course there is other more concrete evidence other than my childhood reading material. For instance, just take a look at Russian cuisine. They have a mead-like beverage called &lt;a href="http://russiapedia.rt.com/of-russian-origin/medovukha/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Medovukha&lt;/a&gt;, which is made with honey and yeast. It's apparently a traditional drink at weddings over there. Also, you've got Russian honey cakes and &lt;a href="http://russian.lingualift.com/blog/honey-tradition-russia/" rel="nofollow"&gt;other food based items&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, honey is also a good preservative as it's antibacterial, so it was often mixed in with jams back in the day to preserve them. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So I'd be surprised if many of the ex-soviet brewers didn't use honey as an additive to their beer. Especially if the beers you have in mind are bottle conditioned, they would need to add a sweetener of sorts for proper carbonation. I've used honey in two of my home brews and I like it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Perhaps some substantiating points:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Baltika Medovoe Light seems to be a popular "first Russian beer" to try. It's a pale lager with natural honey added.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed honey does seem to have played a central role in Russian culture.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Like the Assumption, the three "Saviors" (&lt;em&gt;Spas&lt;/em&gt;), August 1, 6, and 16, were associated with the fruits of the earth. The first was called the "Honey" (&lt;em&gt;medovyi&lt;/em&gt;) or "Wet Savior" (&lt;em&gt;mokryi Spas&lt;/em&gt;), signifying either the gathering of honey or the religious procession and blessing of the waters traditional for this day.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=-s36xYcqG1EC" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ivanits, L. "Russian Folk Belief." [http://books.google.com]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;According to Russian historian Vasili Kliuchevskii (1841–1911), we must learn about the Russian forest, river and steppe in order to understand the Russian people. [...] "The forest provided the Russian with oak and pine to build his house, it warmed him with aspen and birch, it lit his hut with birchwood splinters, it shod him in birch bast sandals, it gave him plates and dishes, clothed him in hides and furs and fed him honey. The forest was the best shelter from his enemies."&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EDvKpNzNBD0C" rel="nofollow"&gt;Riordan, J. "Russian Fairy Tales and Their Collectors." [http://books.google.com]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's notable how closely intertwined honey and their ideals of paradise were, as found by a search for the term "honey" in &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=C46rAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;q=honey#v=snippet&amp;amp;q=honey&amp;amp;f=false" rel="nofollow"&gt;"The Paradise Myth in Eighteenth-century Russia: Utopian Patterns in Early Secular Russian Literature and Culture"&lt;/a&gt; (Baehr, S. L.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, though still conjecture, it may be so that Russian culture has had a higher demand for honey notes in their foods and beverages, naturally selecting those tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Frankly, it may simply be the case that there's not an objective ("provable") answer to this question.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's important enough that many British brewers modify the composition of their water to more closely mimic the mineral content of water drawn from wells near &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burton_upon_Trent" rel="nofollow"&gt;Burton upon Trent&lt;/a&gt;, where traditional styles are considered to originate from. This process is called &lt;em&gt;Burtonisation&lt;/em&gt;. I've noticed for my part that some traditional bitters I've drunk have had a noticeable and not entirely pleasant aroma somewhat like old eggs, which I would guess is the sulphur content that is added in this process. I don't particularly care for beers that taste like this, but each to their own.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Depends what you mean with Belgian Triple. As I understand in the US it is used as a style name and it is base on the Westmalle Triple. You can see the style discription in the answer of Schleis. But if you want to know what to expect, try Westmalle Triple, it's a good (my preferred) benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In Belgium it's not a style. It's merely a label to mark that more ingredient were used, comparatively with the other beers within the same brewery.
					A little history:
					The ingredients to make beer were expensive in the middle ages, so the brewers tried to use as little as possible for there beer. There was however also an market for more tasteful, more expensive, beer. To differentiate between the brewed barrels they used X for the cheap bear, XX for the expensive one. Not saying that there were double the ingredients in it, just more. Later came also XXX. You can still find these X's on some labels these days.
					The name Triple is a more recent appellation (1930's), but it is based on the same idea.
					A classic trio you find in Belgium, but with a lot of exceptions, is a blond(X), a brown (XX, double) and a strong blond ale (XXX, triple). These are relative references, within the brewery and like already mentioned, more ingredients, not doubling or tripling the amount of ingredients. Making the beers stronger in alcohol and taste.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I guess you now also know what to expect with a quadruple...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Water is the primary ingredient in beer.  In my opinion, the water quality is more important than anything else.  I believe in drinking beer for health, and as I don't drink dirty municipal water, why would I drink beer from it?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Just think about city water from a second.  Much of it comes from the same river that the sewage is dumped in.  Just because the stink has been taken out of it with carbon filters, does that make it tasty to you?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, I don't believe in drinking sodium fluoride.  No rat poison in my beer, thank you.  I don't care how many people say that it's in there for your smile.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When I buy commercial beer, my primary criteria is the water.  If it is fluoridated, no thanks.  If it is spring water, super thanks!  Spring water is natural and it has natural minerals built in.  Also, you will notice that the finest beers have spring water.  See BFM of Switzerland and Samuel Smith of England.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a Belgian chap, I obviously love our beer :). More specific, my favorite beers are always tripel beers.
					The thing about tripel beers is that the fermentation is achieved further in the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In general I can tell you all tripel beers are always pretty blonde looking (maybe slightly darker) and doubles are always darker (like really brown!).
					In Belgium, we would call a double beer a dark beer (Double Leffe we would call: Donkere Leffe or Dark Leffe in English).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The taste of double beers will always be sweeter while tripel beers are far more bitter.
					I don't like those sweet drinks so I very much prefer tripel beers.
					However, all tripel beers are different from each other so there is not a real way of describing them. In general bitter, but there are sweeter tripels as well...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The difference in taste between blonde and tripel beers in general is that tripel beers have far more flavors (= more expensive) than blonde beers. The sad thing is that blonde beers are very popular and I don't even know why... Tripel beers have way more flavors :).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a side note, my favorite beers are: Tripel Karmeliet and Tripel Kasteelbier.
					The more poular (blonde) beers are Duvel and Leffe for example. Both in my opinion hugely overrated beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/110/what-is-the-highest-alcohol-content-achievable-through-brewing?rq=1"&gt;This might be a duplicate question&lt;/a&gt;, but since as far as I know beer uses fermentation and no distillation, I expect the maximum alcohol level to be around the same maximum as for wine, which I believe is &lt;a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090518144252AA2xvY1" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;somewhere around the 13% to 15% level (by volume) as this is the level around which micro organisms seem to die&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I know some beers in the 10% to 12% range, like the Dutch &lt;a href="http://www.biernet.nl/bier/merken/grolsch-kanon" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;het Kanon ("the canon") by Grolsch&lt;/a&gt; at 11.6% and &lt;a href="http://www.biernet.nl/bier/merken/hertog-jan-grand-prestige" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Grand Prestige by Hertog Jan&lt;/a&gt; at 10%, both of which I like. They have a bit of a sweet caramel-like flavour, but I'm not sure if that related to the amount of alcohol in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are strains of &lt;em&gt;Saccharomyces Cerevisiae&lt;/em&gt; (brewer's yeast) such as &lt;a href="http://www.whitelabs.com/yeast/wlp099-super-high-gravity-ale-yeast"&gt;WLP099 - Super High Gravity Ale Yeast&lt;/a&gt; that reportedly can tolerate up to &lt;strong&gt;25%&lt;/strong&gt; alcohol by volume. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There was a national drink called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medovukha" rel="nofollow"&gt;"Medovukha"&lt;/a&gt; (Med - honey). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Nowadays it is very rare drink, meaning that few people consume it. The drink has almost same properties and is brewed just like beer. So, I suppose, this drink has influenced Russian tastes. And during soviet times Russia have shared this tastes around all Soviet block. 
					By the way, I'm sure not all beers have honey flavour, however almost every brewery makes as well honey flavoured beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There has been a bit of a battle recently, with Brewdog and Schorschbräu constantly topping each other's efforts: &lt;a href="http://www.brewdog.com/blog-article/the-battle-to-brew-the-worlds-strongest-ever-beer" rel="nofollow"&gt;BrewDog Blog.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Currently it's a &lt;strong&gt;Schorschbräu Schorschbock 57% finis coronat opus, which comes in at 57.7%&lt;/strong&gt;, beating Brewdog's latest effort: &lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/schorschbrau-schorschbock-57-finis-coronat-opus/154245/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Schorschbräu Schorschbock 57% finis coronat opus.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'd say the strongest commercially viable option &lt;em&gt;(these 50% beers only ever have a few bottles in the batch and cost a silly amount)&lt;/em&gt; in the UK anyway, is &lt;strong&gt;Watt Dickie&lt;/strong&gt;, also by Brewdog, which comes in at &lt;strong&gt;35.0%&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.brewdog.com/product/watt-dickie" rel="nofollow"&gt;BrewDog UK.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;EDIT:&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Oops, I didn't know about &lt;strong&gt;Snake Venom, 67.5%&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.brewmeister.co.uk/#/snake-venom/4580369643" rel="nofollow"&gt;Brewmeister Beer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I suppose it depends on how one defines beer. Following the German Reinheitsgebot, beer may contain only 4 ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Water&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Yeast&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Hops&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Barly malt&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beverages which do not adhere to these restrictions may not be labeled as beer in Germany, and several other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To my knowlege, the strongest beer of kind is &lt;a href="http://www.benz-weltweit.de/derbraeuvomberch/index2.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Schorschbock 57&lt;/a&gt;, an ice-distilled doppelbock with 57,5% alcohol content.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It depends on your definition, commercially available is Kwak, around the same as wine, if you go to the Grand Place it comes in those horse &amp;amp; cart designed bulbous glasses (like a mini yard of ale). Once you go above that the others are all pretty specialist.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Similar to the new question, 'what temperature should I serve my beer', which I've just commented on - serving warm beer is largely a myth! The continental Europeans think British beer is served 'luke-warm'. No. Cool, not ice-cold is the preference, at a cellar temp around 13C (room temp being 20-22C). Not sure where the OP is from, but they appear to believe that all Europeans drink warm to hot beer&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I really thought the myth of warm or luke-warm beer had dissipated - obviously not. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In general, G(u)euze Beer is pretty sour.
					More on that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gueuze" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
					Since I don't like Geuze beer, I don't know much about it. However, I once tasted 7 different Geuze beers from a region in Belgium around Brussels and those were really sour. I wouldn't recommend those.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'd start an introduction to sour, or wild ales  with the more approachable Lambics, like &lt;a href="http://www.lindemans.be/start/framboise/en" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lindemans Framboise Lambic&lt;/a&gt;.  With a beer like that, the sour notes from the wild yeast are offset by the sweetness of the fruit and the pleasant texture from the fizz of the carbonation, making it an approachable drink not only for one not used to sour ales, but for one not used to beer at all.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another option (for a North American) might be a beer categorized as an American Wild Ale, such as Russian River's Consecration, or Sierra Nevada Brux which will have the sour character but also be conscientious of the flavors favorable to the American palate.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You might also want to try a berliner weisse. They can be pretty sour, but are still very drinkable (at least in my opinion). Some breweries have these on tap, and offer a choice of flavored syrup as a sweetener (e.g., raspberry, strawberry, peach). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In terms of bottled ones to look for, Dogfish head has Festina Peche. My current favorite is Cruiser, a recent release by the Ithaca Beer Co. available in 6 packs and pretty reasonably priced. Berliner Weisse are usually available this time of year, so check your local beer store for some other seasonals.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would highly recommend Rodenbach as a starting point. It is relatively inexpensive, surprisingly available for it's style, and damn tasty. It is a Flanders Red style, brewed with sour cherries, of which there are many similar brands ranging from candy-sweet to very sour. Rodenbach is the perfect balance of the two IMO. If you like the style, graduate to the Grand Cru, which adds more age, funk and sour. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;After these I'd check out Flanders Brown ales (similar though less cherry), and Geuzes, such as Almanac's Golden Gate Gose. If you're feeling adventurous and spendy, make your way through Almanac's unique "Farm to Barrel" series of wild fruit beers, as well as The Bruery's Oude Tarte and possibly Sour in the Rye (warning, this one will melt your tastebuds).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I will update this answer when I get more information from OP about region but I believe the following will be helpful: [edit]: reread the tags and spotted that it was US - think that my thoughts all still stand up but will check some specifics on US beer festivals.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the UK and a few other countries and regions organizations like CAMRA (the Campaign for Real Ale) run beer festivals which work out, on a pint for pint basis, cheaper when trying a wide variety of beers. Although there is usually an entry fee (at least as far as CAMRA events go) each drink tends to be cheaper and there is the option of trying more different beers by buying in half pint measures (recommended). The biggest benefit of going to festivals, however, is the &lt;em&gt;range&lt;/em&gt; of beers available. A liquor store / off license / bar can only really stock a few different beers and these are usually ones that they can get consistently, in volume, and at either a suitable price or within their tie (don't get me started on the beer tie), whereas festivals are much freer to buy different beers from varying sources as they are one-off events and less restricted.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A second idea would be to set up a tasting club so that you can share the costs and the beers. This runs the risk (!) of making new friends as well!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;source: I help to run a CAMRA beer festival and work at 2+ others dependent on my free time&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can look for breweries in your areas that give tours. These often include free tastings. (Since you mentioned you're from the Chicago area, I know there's a bus tour that takes you to different breweries in Chicago and Milwaukee. There's a fee, but you'd get to try a lot of different beers.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, look for brewpubs and restaurants in your area that sell &lt;em&gt;flights&lt;/em&gt; of beer. A flight is 4-5 samples of different beers served together. The cost is normally about the same as a full glass, and the total volume is usually the same or a little more. This allows you to try 4 or 5 different beers for about the same price as you'd normally pay for one.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most beer shops and some grocery stores (if that's legal in your state) allow you to do a "Mixer-Sixer" or "Create your own six-pack" where you can combine a variety of single bottles/cans for a variety six pack.  You pay a little bit extra per bottle for the convenience but and you get to pick specifically which ones you try.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To learn your preferences, I would suggest the following styles: (ordered from darkest to lightest with a recommended beer in parenthesis)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Stout (Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Double Bock/Doppelbock (Ayinger Doppelbock)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;IPA (Dogfish Head 60min or 90min IPA)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Pale Ale (Sierra Nevada Pale Ale)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Pilsner (Bell's Beer by Bells Brewery - this is a traditional Czech Pilsner)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Hefeweizen (Paulaner Bavarian Hefeweizen)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;@Bill The Lizard's answer:  Going on a brewery tour is definitely good advice.  Additionally, you should consider getting beer on tap which tends to be fresher and in better condition while at restaurants or breweries.  Furthermore, if you have the chance to visit a brewery, you should specifically try their seasonal, limited, and special releases.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you venture west to Iowa most HyVee stores will let you do the mixer-sixer as Gastrograph describes. Two of Iowa's best breweries are on the eastern side of the state as well in Toppling Goliath and Backpocket.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I live in a state that (mostly) requires that you buy beer by the case.  I feel your pain.  ("Mostly": there's still the bar option, and there are a very few places where you can buy mixed cases or six-packs of things other than the big mainstream beers.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The solution I'm partial to is the beer co-op.  Mine started as a group of coworkers; we've scattered to a bunch of different companies by now, but the co-op remains.  Every 4-6 weeks the organizer sends out email announcing a planned buy, with the goal of getting a multiple of 8 people (12 works, but we prefer 8).  Participants get a case with variety of beers and divide the total cost.  I've gotten to sample some beers I'd never have tried (or known about) otherwise.  (Most people don't participate every time, but the organizer does because, hey, beer.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're doing a co-op anyway, then it's easy to add on the occasional "side buy" -- something that comes in 25oz bottles, or is particularly expensive, etc.  So long as there's enough interest to get the case, people can then buy them individually.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can be very organized about this, requiring commitments in advance, or you can be flexible and deal with the occasional surplus.  People interested enough to organize co-ops &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; don't mind some surplus (assuming finances aren't too tight).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The answer to this question is going to depend largely on which specific beers you are referring to.  Assuming you are referring to Becks Premium Lager (as opposed to one of their other offerings), Becks has an IBU (International Bitterness Units) of 20 where Heineken has 23 IBUs.  Based on IBUs, Heineken should be more bitter but not by much.  What you're tasting could be accounted for by batch to batch variation on behalf of the brewer or the conditions that the bottles were stored (length of storage, lighting, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the bitterness in most of Becks' beers come from the use of darker malts, while the majority of the bitterness in Heineken comes from the use of (pellet) hops. 
					This makes the bitterness in Becks tend towards roastier flavors, and the bitterness in Heineken to tend to be more herbaceous or floral. It is possible that you are more personally sensitive to one set of those flavor compounds.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Note that IBUs are an imperfect measurement of bitterness so only consider it as an approximation.  Many people say that differences in bitterness beyond 100 IBUs are indiscernible but that is often conflicted.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's basically because of the ingredients - the two beers contain different amounts of sweet and bitter flavors which balance out to give you the perceived bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some will say that it's because of higher hop bitterness, measured in IBUs (International Bitterness Units), but this is really only part of the picture. You can have a beer with a larger number of IBUs but also a large amount of residual sweetness such as caramel malts) and this will generally taste sweeter than a beer that has a lower IBUs and almost no residual sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Each brewer designs a beer with a taste profile in mind, and then seeks ingredients and sometimes process changes to arrive at this desired flavor profile. This often requires several iterations until the desired result is reached, and even then it may not be possible to reach it every time, so the brewer may also choose to blend beers from different batches to arrive close to the desired result. The same is true for Heineken - their Quality Assurance team will have been given clear guidelines on the spec for the beer, both as hard and fast measurable, objective facts (IBUs, Color, carbonation, diacetyl, fusel alcohols, esters etc...) and also as subjective - how it tastes. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So the final answer about why one beer is more bitter than another is because their respective breweries have decided that's the flavor they want, and they have crafted a brew to produce their chosen flavor profile.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is really incomplete since you haven't given us your locale.  But Tremens is a Belgian Golden Strong ale, so you could find similar flavors in anything with a description like "Belgian Gold", "Belgian Strong", "Belgian Pale", "Tripel", "Blonde" (Except American Blonde).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For well-known brands you'd be looking for something like... Duvel, Piraat, Hades (Great Divide), St. Bernardus Tripel, Chimay, Westmalle, Leffe Blonde, La Trappe Blonde, a few of the beers by Unibroue...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beck's is a pale German pilsner brewed by Beck's Brewery headquartered in Bremen.  The actual beer you drank was likely brewed in St. Louis, however, as Beck's is wholly owned by AB InBev.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Pale Lagers as a style are usually straw colored, up to a light gold with a white head.  The flavor is very light and dry with only slight malty sweetness.  A little crisp hop bitterness without too much hop aroma.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most "macrobrews" will be somewhat similar, though the stock "American" variant of Pale Lager like Budweiser or Miller will have a corn sugar flavor to them and likely be a bit lighter in body.  Beck's claimed to adhere to the German Beer Purity Law which would prohibit the use of an adjunct like corn.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;St. Pauli Girl is a very similar beer, and I think is even brewed in the same town as the original Beck's.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you want to stick with imports just about any pale German lager is going to do it for you since it's a very traditional style.  Anything by Spaten, Hacker-Pschorr, or Weihenstephan is solid and usually pretty easy to get ahold of.  Pilsner-Urquell is also a great beer, but it's in the Pilsner style so while it's still a pale lager Pilsners can have a sulfur-y or buttery tinge due to the green bottles and slight diacetyl.  Pilsners also have a strong hop character and bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to try local or American brewed versions just about anyone's Session Lager (Full Sail comes to mind, as does Notch if you're near MA at all) should be similar.  According to &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/place/city/6/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this list&lt;/a&gt; on BeerAdvocate you should be near Berghoff and Baderbrau which will both make traditional German styles.  Some breweries, Baderbrau included, will call their pale lager a "Lawnmower beer".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Branching out, Sam Adams Boston Lager is a style called Vienna Lager which may also appeal you.  Though it will be significantly maltier than Beck's.  Anything with Dortmunder in the name will also be similar, though hoppier but not like an American Pale Ale or IPA or anything.  You might also be interested in any brewery's Cream Ale, which is an Ale version of the Pale Lager style.  Kolsch style beers may also appeal to you since they share the same light body and slight maltiness.  Kolsch's are hybrid beers which are fermented warm like an Ale would be, but then cold conditioned like a Lager.  Officially Kolsch can only be brewed in Cologne, Germany, but many American breweries will make a Kolsch style since it drinks really well in the summer and provides more flavor variety than pale lager or Cream Ale.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Does that help?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would suggest going with the beers that are brewed closest to you. Although transportation and supply chain storage has greatly improved, beer is always best when you are closest to the source. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina Brewers Guild will be a great resource for you to find beers in your area.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbeer.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.ncbeer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Belgian style beers, like the Delirium Tremens are growing in popularity very quickly. You should have no trouble finding some in your local area. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This might be a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You should try the famous smoke beer "Schlenkerla". Maybe you can find it in North Carolina: &lt;a href="http://www.schlenkerla.de/verkauf/haendlerint/retailer-us.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.schlenkerla.de/verkauf/haendlerint/retailer-us.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have personally used Pintley on iOS (but it's cross platform) and found it to be a pretty good app.  The quality of the graphics isn't intensely refined, but the beer list is very comprehensive.  I found that the beer list was one of the most important things in an app like this, since I was usually in quick situations when I wanted to record and rate a beer.  I didn't want to be out with friends and browsing through a ton of pages to finally have to input all the details of a beer that was fairly common.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine just switched to Beer Citizen (also cross platform), which seems to have a more refined look.  I've done some searching through the database though, and there seems to be quite a bit missing...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When I try to pick beers for friends that don't tend to like "regular beer" in general, there are a few different styles I focus on.  It's worth mentioning up front that there are certain taste aversions that people have to different beers.  You mentioned getting her into a vanilla porter.  I have a favorite from Mill Street in Canada; they make a great vanilla porter.  The caveat though is that I like coffee a lot, and many people averse to beer tend to have trouble with the intense flavors of different varieties of beer, such as extreme hoppiness, heavily malted barley, or, darkly roasted barley that make up stouts and porters.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You mentioned less fruity beers, but talked about "Wild Blue" when you mentioned that.  Wild Blue is a Blueberry flavored lager; it's basically a "regular beer," but is infused with blueberry flavor to change it up.  I would look at other "fruity" styles that are still very authentic and internationally renowned, but pack less of a general beer flavor than a filtered rice/grain/barley beer would...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A good starter would be a more heavily wheat based beer.  Styles like Belgian wheats or German hefeweizens have less of that pronounced "regular beer" flavor, but are still in their own right, very prolific styles.  I tend to find Belgian wheats/"weisse/wittes(whites)" to be a bit more "chewy" with more of a banana/coriander flavor than their full blown German counterparts.  Good wheats that I would recommend would be Franziskaner or Hoegaarden.  They're safe forays into that style of beer that I almost always tend to get for new drinkers.  The cool thing is that if she likes them, you can really experiment with other varieties in that field.  Belgian doubles and triples tend to generally fall into a similar category, and they're arguably some of the finest beers in the world...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In my country, girls commonly love sweet beers. An example is Kriek. It is cherry beer (kriek is Dutch for cherry).
					I guess any sweet fruity beer could do the trick?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It won't be harmful, but neither will it taste any good. Pale low-alcohol beers don't age very well, and a beer that was low on flavour to start with is not going to improve with time. You'll get lots of wet cardboard flavours and a very thin body. I would pour it out.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is unlikely to be harmful (assuming it hasn't become infected), but the flavour may have changed compared to fresher bottles of the same brand.  In particular, the aromatic oils from the hops will break down as the beer ages.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Whether this makes the beer undrinkable will depend partly on the beer and partly on the tastes of the person drinking it.  If you are curious you may as well try a mouthful or two.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The pH of beer is low enough that no known pathogens can survive in it. That's why you never hear about botulism problems with home-brewed beer like you do with home-canned foods, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer slowly changes over time. High gravity beers, like barley wines or imperial stouts benefit from this, and acquire richer flavors as they slowly oxydize. Belgian styles, like lambics do as well and the wild yeasts and bacteria continue to grow. However, even those have a limit -- eventually they will begin to taste very stale. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Low gravity beers begin to taste stale much more quickly. If you are keeping them refrigerated, they may last for 6 months or more. Seven years is definitely way too long.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So it won't make you sick or harm you if you want to taste it. But it is extremely unlikely that you will enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;No. The most important thing is, that you control if the beer lathers when you open it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If there is no foam, throw it away ;) &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;best regards from austria&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hop Union has an "&lt;a href="http://www.hopunion.com/aroma-wheel/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Aroma Wheel&lt;/a&gt;" that can help with scent:  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also look at the &lt;a href="http://www.hopunion.com/hop-varieties/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Hop Variety&lt;/a&gt; page to get a little more information.&lt;br&gt;
					The thing to remember is scent doesn't always translate to taste, especially with hoppy beers such as IPA's after the beer has aged a bit. To get the taste you really need to try a beer made only with that hop (my opinion) to see what characteristics it imparts. Hop Union does have a &lt;a href="http://www.hopunion.com/hop-and-brew-school/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Hop and Brew School&lt;/a&gt; every year for both craft (professional) brewers and home brewers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can buy a small selection of a few hops and a 6 or 12 pack of bud light or coors light.  Pop the tops, toss in a few hops, re-cap and mark what hop is in each.  Wait a day or two and then taste.  This will highlight the aroma and some of the upfront flavors of the hop more than it's bitterness and will get you familiar with that hop variety.  This does require having a bottle caper and some caps, but those can be bought either at a local homebrew store or online for less than 20 dollars when you purchase the small 1oz bags of hops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you homebrew, try to brew small brew in a bag batches of 1 gallon to try different hop varieties. I don't do it too often but it's an easy 3 hour brew day and helps a lot with identifying hop profiles for bitterness, late addition, and dry hopping.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You have different beer types.
					For example, Kilkenny (Ginger Irish beer) is really tasty.
					Guinness, with an hard hops aroma.
					White beers from Germany are really tasty too, weight, but don't drink it too much...
					Belgium got blond et brunes, &amp;amp; are really famous.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Or, for a sweety beer, you can drink some banana, cherry, strawberry, cherry, passions beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Best beers comes from Eire, Germany &amp;amp; Belgium ;)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is a great question, I'm still learning but here's what I've tried:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Single hop beers.&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm in the UK but here's what I've managed to get in the past&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://mikkeller.dk/2013/07/05/single-hop-ipas/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mikkeller&lt;/a&gt; single hop series &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;IPA is dead by &lt;a href="http://www.brewdog.com/blog-article/ipa-is-dead-2013" rel="nofollow"&gt;BrewDog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Arbor often do single hop beers&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your mileage may vary but if you keep your eye out, hopefully you'll find a local brewer doing this kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've also had a couple of single yeast flights which were very enlightening.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Tastings&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A couple of hops really stick in my mind because of when I had them. I remember going to a tasting of a local's brewers Galaxy IPA and he'd filled the shop with glasses of Galaxy hops and it smelled incredable.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another time was tasting a Sorachi Ace beer by Wiper and True. It was horrific, but hearing the descriptions my fellow drinkers came up with and having the brewer explaining the history of the hop really anchored it to me. It meant when I had Little Things that Kill by weird beard, I could pick it out straight away.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The other thing that I enjoy is learning where and when and why a hop has come about. European hops are so different from American which are different again from British. Not to mention New Zealand hops which have their own aromas. Obviously it's not always consistant but being able to say what kind of region a hop tastes like is a good start!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would also recommend she try a sour ale. They are a completely different kind of beer that doesn't taste like "normal beer". Since it's often the standard "beer" flavor that some don't like, going outside of the standard can't be a great way to find a favorable flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Flemish sours are excellent and would be a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would drink it, if it wasn't Bud Light ;-)
					I had old beer before, probably 2 years after expiration. If the pressure is still there when you open it and if the can/bottle has no dents/rust/etc there shouldn't be an issue.
					They found a WWII food can and it was still edible when they opened in 2013, tested by a lab. Obviously taste is a different issue. There may be some deterioration. If it smells like vinegar you'll know it's bad &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, a disclaimer:  I'm American and most of my knowledge of craft beer comes from the American beer scene.  I am somewhat aware of the evolution of the UK brewing industry, but nowhere near as knowledgeable as I am about America's.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Now, definitions.  Craft Beer commonly derives the Brewer's Association definition of a Craft Brewer.  Which is Small, Independent, Traditional.  Sparing the specifics it's a definition meant to exclude the world's largest brewing companies, and their "crafty" portfolios.  "Crafty" is a pejorative used to describe brands or brewers which may or may not produce good tasting beer, but are owned by the larger brands in attempts to diversify their portfolios.  While the BA is primarily focused on the American market, it seems most European writers defer to their terms.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Real Ale, is a distinctly British term.  Coined by CAMRA in the 70's it's more to do with the packaging and serving of the beer in the pub than the business scale of the brewer.  All Real Ale has to do is be cask conditioned and served via a gravity tap or hand-pulled with a beer engine.  This excludes a majority of what we in the US would consider craft beer, because it excludes anything kegged, filtered, force carbonated, or pushed with pressurized gas.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This leads to an interesting overlap where an unfiltered beer, carbonated by natural fermentation, could NOT be a real ale because it was kegged and served on gas.  Also, nothing prevents a large brand like Murphy's or Beamish (both owned by Heineken) from marketing a "Real Ale".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These definitions aside: It sounds like you may just be an IPA fan.  Your craft beer list is entirely IPAs.  It's not really accurate to conflate Craft and IPAs because plenty of craft beers are stouts, rye beers, Scotch ales, English bitters, or totally non-traditional things.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another issue you might have with "Real Ale" is a technical note.  Because it's exposed to oxygen as soon as the cask is tapped real ale tends to spoil if it's not drank quickly.  The characteristic tastes of oxidized beer are cardboard, and the characteristic tastes of beer left on dead yeast for way too long is soapy.  I can easily see that coming off as "waxy", especially if it's warmer than you're used to drinking and you've just downed some IPAs.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer today is probably the best its ever tasted because of refinements in production techniques and farming.  Consumers are becoming interested in what their beer is made of so the quality of ingredients and care on a whole is improving.  But real ale is a niche,  there are going to be great traditional brewers making phenomenal beer, but it's prone to spoilage if not treated well.  There may also be those using it as a marketing gimmick.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And finally a last point about industrialization:  It has vastly improved the quality of ingredient and process that all brewers use.  The huge brands we now have, all started off as craft at one point.  But if they are no longer craft they either couldn't weather the market and faced the choice of no longer being a company or selling to a business and risk becoming more about business than beer.  In the US we have large breweries proving you can still be pretty big and make good beer.  Sam Adams, Stone Brewing, Dogfish Head, Yuengling, are HUGE by craft standards and haven't compromised the quality of their ingredients because brewers are still in charge.  Industrialization will never prevent a brewery lead by a passionate brewer from making interesting beer, but leaving brewing decisions up to a business man will always making boring beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From what I have researched, the term "real ale" derives from the original distinction between beer, which was brewed with hops, and ale, which was not.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The term real ale also relates to whether or not the drink was artificially carbonated or cask conditions. Craft beer is generally brewed with hops, although some craft brewers are trying to use other bittering agents. Likewise, there are craft brewers who use cask conditioning and even more so, bottle conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would say that "craft" beer is a rather vague term. The best way that I could distinguish between "craft" brewers and other brewers is through the use of "craft" or trade. Those who produce beer as a trade would be craft brewers rather as opposed to industrial producers. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;No pathogens can survive in beer. But the beer may taste off. Remember that the Pilgrims survived the journey across the Atlantic because they had beer, not water, since beer stays drinkable much longer due to the alcohol and hops that act as preservatives. Nothing will happen to you if you drink that beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Heineken is the closest. I only actually enjoy two brands of beer: Heineken used to be my favorite until I got bored with it and the store clerk recommended Beck's. They go hand in hand! Like peas in a pod!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beck's is a German pilsner (a type of lager), sharp, crisp, flavorfull, and is not filling. Beck's uses roasted hops and has a more bitter earthy flavor with much less foam.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The flavor of other "light lagers" (european pilsners) may be similar, however, a German pilsner is much easier to drink because, unlike most other light lager beers, a true pilsner is much less filling and has much less foam. German pilsners are noted for "drinkability". Beck's can be consumed with a large meal and then consumed afterwards as well. I believe this is why many non beer drinkers prefer and enjoy Beck's and almost no other beer. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilsner#Pilsner_beer_styles" rel="nofollow"&gt;Click here for a list of "German style pilsners" as well as a list of the other types of similar beers and what makes them different&lt;/a&gt; Light lagers such as Heinekin, Stella, Amstel, etc ... are "European pilsner" beers typically labeled as lager whereas a German pilsner beer is typically labeled "pilsner" or "pils".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/81/37570/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Heineken does produce a true pilsner variety&lt;/a&gt; but it is not officially distributed or available within the United States. &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/81/246/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Heineken lager&lt;/a&gt; is distributed and sold throughout North America and has much more body and is more filling as one would expect from a light lager or "european pilsner".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sam Adams Gold pilsner is described as having "great body". This is not a characteristic of most German pilsners that are sharp and light bodied. This beeradvocate post goes on to say that &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/articles/216/" rel="nofollow"&gt;"This is one of those beers to give to a Bud drinker"&lt;/a&gt; . . . definitely not something most people would say of Beck's. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Similar beers include: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Pauli_Girl" rel="nofollow"&gt;St Pauli Girl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;pilsner&lt;/strong&gt; (not to be confused with St Pauli Girl lager) is brewed for export only at the Beck's brewery in Bremen Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsingtao_Brewery" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tsingtao&lt;/a&gt;, a Chinese brewed German pilsner. Tsingtao is a product of the German occupation of Qingdao from the late 1800s until 1914. Not quite a flavorful as Beck's because the original recipe has changed but still a German pilsner in many aspects. Tsingtao is widely available at many Asian restaurants throughout North America and is a much better alternative or substitute for Beck's than Heinekin or Stella.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Löwenbräu produces Beck's under licence for southern Germany and other parts of europe and is known for similar flavor (but then again, so is Heineken).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/articles/216/" rel="nofollow"&gt;here is another list of German Pilsners.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Update:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're going to go the way of sam adams, at least get the right kind of beer and not some awful american lager. &lt;a href="https://www.samueladams.com/craft-beers/noble-pils" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sam Adams makes a Noble Pils.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Noble hops are the type of hops German pilsners are distinct for, strong hops flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Even better is &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/10607/62989/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sixpoint crisp&lt;/a&gt;. Strong hops flavor, easy to drink, and almost no hint of barley. More fruty than Beck's. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=2&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0CCsQFjAB&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPilsner_Urquell&amp;amp;ei=5P7GVIW-GMmyggS8s4GIAw&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNG2zAjSX00VamqUUpxEorf_KRbDiw&amp;amp;bvm=bv.84349003,d.eXY" rel="nofollow"&gt;Pilsner Urquell&lt;/a&gt; has a bit more foam than I would like from a German beer (probably because it's not German) but still did not weigh heavy on my stomach and easy to drink as well. Not quite as much flavor but I did not try the bottle. This one is a traditional pils.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I tried another German beer at the bar recently "&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://us.weihenstephaner.com/en/our-beers/?slide=Original%20Premium#slider-beer-main" rel="nofollow"&gt;Weihenstephaner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; original", brewed at the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weihenstephan_Abbey" rel="nofollow"&gt;world's oldest brewery&lt;/a&gt; in Germany and brewed according to the German purity law of 1516. Sure enough, I didn't have to burp once. Drank a full pint glass and wasn't bloated one bit. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finally, the taste was the same familiar strong, pungent, and bitter hoppy taste I've grown so fond of from drinking German Beck's over the years and yes it comes in a very dark brown bottle. The bitterness is ranked at 21. They also make a pils with a bitterness of 32.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I feel it should be added that beer brewed in Germany often conforms to the Reinheitsgebot or the German purity law of 1516. This gives German beer the crisp fresh taste and this is also why the foam doesn't linger and make you feel bloated. In all other countries, including the united states, beer manufacturers are known to &lt;a href="http://foodbabe.com/2013/07/17/the-shocking-ingredients-in-beer/" rel="nofollow"&gt;include many other ingredients&lt;/a&gt;. Notably, chemicals are added for "head retention" that are not included in German beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;3 ingredients help beer stay good,
					alcohol, hop and Yeast.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;so beers above 5% or really bitter beers.
					Or beers with yeast in the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;for example geuzes are at their best after 7 to 15 years, and stay drinkable for more than 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The taste changes over the period.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In my experience, blanche and saisons are always beers that are enjoyed, even from people who are not beer lovers. 
					The scent of spices and fruit make them interesting, and the flavor is much more "traditional" than trappist beers (which are awesome, but also different).
					For a second try, I would go with IPA and APA (but they are much more bitter), and the aroma is more similar to tropical fruits.
					As a third, I would go with Belgian beers ("abbey" style), like a Golden Ale. You could try Chouffe, for example (or Affligem blonde). Sweet, round beer that has a wonderful malt taste.    &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;PS: I'm not suggesting particular brands as I understand you are in US, I don't know common brands there. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In my experience, different women have quite different tastes, but there are a few beers that seem to appeal to women much more than they do to men, so I'll try recommending those.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innis &amp;amp; Gunn&lt;/strong&gt; (original) is an obvious candidate. It's a very bland beer that's stored on American bourbon casks for a while. This gives it a strong, perfumy vanilla aroma. Some people think it feels artificial, but it's really not. It's the aroma of the American oak. Given that your friend loves vanilla it seems the obvious place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duchesse du Bourgogne&lt;/strong&gt; is technically a Flemish red. It's a sweetish beer that's been stored in wooden barrels so that it turns a little acidic, too. Kind of fruity, kind of vinous, little bitterness. It's really a classic beer, and while many men love it (me among them), even more women seem to like it. Really worth trying.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;German weissbier&lt;/strong&gt; is sweetish, not sour, not at all bitter, and has a gentle banana flavour that comes from the yeast. Again it's something that many men like, and more women. Good examples are Weihenstephaner, Paulaner, and Erdinger (in that order). US wheat ale might work, too, but they generally use normal ale yeast and thus turn deathly boring.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Belgian witbier&lt;/strong&gt; is similar to the weissbier, even though it uses a more neutral yeast, but then makes up for it with orange peel and coriander. Hoegaarden is the original, but there are many more examples you could try.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Belgian beer&lt;/strong&gt; in general is sweet and low on bitterness. Some good ones to try: Westmalle Trippel, Barbar, Chimay White, La Trappe (legally Dutch), Rochefort, St Bernardus. All of these are fantastic beers that sound like they should appeal to your friend.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sell by dates tend to be very conservative to cover peoples asses, but in reality many beers will actually get better past their sell-by date, particularly unfiltered (cloudy) beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beers like any of the light lagers should be fine for a year or two and not taste significantly worse provided they are stored properly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Improper storage would be somewhere with warm or fluctuating temperature or where the beer is exposed to light. Light is what "skunks" beer, and can literally synthesize the same chemicals that makes skunks smell. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The color of the bottle has a big effect on how rapidly this can occur. Clear glass provides no protection, I would not drink Corona that was left in the sun for even just one day (not that I wouldn't avoid it anyway). Green provides some, but is not much better (blocks somewhere around 40% of light). Brown is the best blocking around 90% of light, but completely opaque materials are the only things that are truly effective. Some breweries like Sam Adams even go the extra mile and have extra tall sides on their six packs to block light completely.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In short, old beer is not dangerous.
					Some styles age well (belgian styles, german wheat, unfiltered styles).
					Others do not (light lagers, pale ales, filtered beers).
					Light is the real enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've drinked beers that were 2 years past the &lt;em&gt;sell by&lt;/em&gt; date. They tasted normal (although i´m not a beer sommellier) and nothing bad happened to me, as other answers have pointed out. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If i were you I would see this as a unique oportunity to test how 7 years of bottle aging change a Lite American Lager. Buy a brand new Bud Light, refrigerate it to the same temperature, open both bottles, pour into equal glasses and see. If they look similar (same color and foam) and the old one doesn´t smell bad, give it a small sip. If it tastes normal, there's no reason for you not to try it!
					  In case you really compare them, can you share with us the differences in color, smell and taste between the new and the 7-years old Bud Light?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer is meant to be stored in a cool, dark place. Light is indeed bad for it and causes "skunking" which produces literally the same chemical skunks produce.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Lots of times re-refrigerating beer implies the beer was left out. Was it left out in a place exposed to light? Particularly sunlight? It may not be the fact that it was exposed to higher temperatures that was the culprit, but the light. Warmer temperatures certainly seem like the most obvious offenders for a sub-par beer, but light is far more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Temperature for the most part should not be an issue. Anything from like 32-75 F should not be an issue, although somewhere between 45-55 F is the ideal cellaring temperature. To break the upper limit of safe temperatures pretty much requires you to leave the beer outdoors during a hot summer where it will likely be joined by the bigger threat of light.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Long story short: cellaring temperatures are for long-term (12 months+) storage and anything between freezing and high-end room temperature shouldn't have any adverse effects if stored someplace dark. The idea that beer needs to remain ice-cold from the moment the yeast is added is a bunch of BMC marketing BS.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;ol&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;UV light exposure causes negative effects (only a real problem for bottled beer).&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;UV light has a photochemical impact on hops. This causes it to have a flavor and aroma of a skunk. Brown bottles help lower the amount of UV light that can get to the beer, and with cans this is a non-issue.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;ol start="2"&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Extreme fluctuations in temperature are generally not good for the beer.&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Extreme temperature fluctuations could impact the flavor of any drink, but most likely will be too subtle to notice. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;ol start="3"&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Bottled beers can sometimes re-ferment at higher temperatures, causing over-carbonation.&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yeast needs sugars to ferment, by the time the bottle is on the shelves, the fermentable sugars are completely fermented and the yeast is in a dormant stage. However, this doesn't mean yeast cannot still affect the flavor of the beer. If the beer is &lt;a href="http://blog.beeriety.com/2009/08/03/what-is-bottle-conditioned-beer/" rel="nofollow"&gt;bottle conditioned&lt;/a&gt;, then it still has live yeast cultures and extra care should be taken to keep it below high temperatures (80+ F.) for long periods of time. You should not be concerned of it exploding (over carbonating), that only happens in homebrews where they added too much sugars or didn't sanitize everything properly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The majority of commercial beers are filtered to such a high degree that there is little to no live yeast to be concerned about. Some beers are even pasteurized to kill any remaining yeast, removing the possibility of it affecting flavor and extending its shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom line is, avoid temperature fluctuations as much as you can, but its not something you should throw away perfectly good beer for.&lt;/strong&gt; If you are a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supertaster" rel="nofollow"&gt;supertaster&lt;/a&gt; that can detect the subtle flavor changes, give it away to one of the 75% of us who are not.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For a full scientific study with facts and figures way over my head you can see: &lt;a href="http://www.academicjournals.org/article/article1380728686_Hiralal%20et%20al.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;Stability profile of flavour-active ester compounds in
					ale and lager beer during storage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you really want to get someone into beer you should avoid gimmicky fruit beers. At that point you aren't really appreciating the beer for the beer in my opinion, and there are plenty of options out there where fruity tastes play a role, but aren't artificial or dominating. But really what you want to do is get her exposed to some top-notch examples of the main styles and get an idea of what she likes and go from there. If we're skipping sours, pale ales and chocolate beer then here are some I always try to hit on with newbies:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Witbier - Light, Belgian wheat beer with orange peel and coriander. Awesome summer beer and one of the most accessible styles. Fruity flavor is just an accent more than the point of the beer.
					Great examples: Hacker Pschorr, Hoegaarden, St. Bernardus&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Dubbel - Dark, Belgian ales brewed with complex blends of malts resulting in deep, rich flavors and notes of dark fruits and spices despite lacking any of these ingredients.
					Great Examples: Cordendonk Abbey Brown Ale, Chimay Red, Rochefort 8&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;German Wheat - Lots of styles within this, but these tend to be a bit heavier than witbier with more of a spicy character and less citrus. These range from the extremely light weissbier to dunkleweizens to the heaviest weizenbocks.
					Great Examples: Weihenstephaner Weiss/Dunkel/Vitus, Schneider Weiss&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Bock - Traditionally the heaviest of lagers, dark and complex but more mild than stouts. Little hop character with complex malts.
					Great Examples - Weihenstephaner Korbinian, Ayinger Celebrator Dopplebock&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Others I might try are a good Coffee Stout Narragansett, a caramel porter like the Sam Adams Holiday Porter, and if you're really striking out with all these Abita's Purple Haze is probably the best fruit-added beer out there aside from sours.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are examples of sour beers where the brewery will suggest taking several sips to get over the initial shock of sourness, so your palette can adjust, allowing you to taste the other flavors. Such beers may or not be bitter (from hops).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the case of bitterness from hops, I think it takes more than a few sips to desensitize yourself, but maybe that's just me.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For really bitter, a double/imperial IPA is the way to go. For the big bitter hop flavors, check out some of these: Stone Ruination IPA, Port Mongo IPA, Russian River Pliny the Elder, Lagunitas (pretty much any of their hoppy beers), Southern Tier 2XIPA, Cigar City Jai Alai. Many more to choose from depending on your location. Maine Beer Company and Kane Brewing are two of my favorite small breweries on the east coast.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As Pepi mentioned, sour beers are certainly very interesting. A great start into the world of sours would be the Oud Bruins -&gt; Monks Flemish Sour Ale, Rodenbach Grand Cru, or Liefman's Goudenband. These will run your a little more $$ but are super refreshing and really great to sip on. They open up and change flavor that longer you leave them out.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Temperature changes aren't great for beers, especially hoppy beers, because temperature swings of greater than 20 degrees will degrade flavor.  But it takes a LOT of that to produce a noticeable effect.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most beer probably went through a few cycles of heating and cooling before it gets to your fridge, especially in the summer.  You know, maybe cold in the brewery but warmed in the truck before cooled in the warehouse then warm in the truck again before hitting a store's cooler.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It'd be hard to notice anything.  Hoppy beers might have their big aromas fade a bit or get a less smooth bitterness.  Anecdotally, some of the smoother DIPA style beers with big floral or citrus hop smells/tastes might degrade into more biting bitter territory.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Big beers made for aging will generally be forgiving but heating and cooling them a lot might make them taste flatter or cardboardy.  But again, we're talking several upon several times before anything noticeable happens.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Long story short...it's probably not going to do anything you're going to notice chilling unopened beers back down from room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I know i'm late to the party here but a good beer that is a sweeter beer but not fruity, is dark but not heavy, and has Chocolate and Vanilla flavors is Koko Brown from Kona Brewing. It's a toasted coconut ale. Very very good. Not overly flavored but you definitely notice the flavoring. One of my favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From the Beer Judge Criteria for an &lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style09.php#1d" rel="nofollow"&gt;Irish Red Ale&lt;/a&gt; which is what I would consider being the closest thing to a Red Lager (A couple of the examples are actually lagers).  This fits the bill for Rickard's Red.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Aroma: Low to moderate malt aroma, generally caramel-like but
					  occasionally toasty or toffee-like in nature. May have a light buttery
					  character (although this is not required). Hop aroma is low to none
					  (usually not present). Quite clean.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Appearance: Amber to deep reddish copper color (most examples have a
					  deep reddish hue). Clear. Low off-white to tan colored head.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Flavor: Moderate caramel malt flavor and sweetness, occasionally with
					  a buttered toast or toffee-like quality. Finishes with a light taste
					  of roasted grain, which lends a characteristic dryness to the finish.
					  Generally no flavor hops, although some examples may have a light
					  English hop flavor. Medium-low hop bitterness, although light use of
					  roasted grains may increase the perception of bitterness to the medium
					  range. Medium-dry to dry finish. Clean and smooth (lager versions can
					  be very smooth). No esters.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body, although examples containing
					  low levels of diacetyl may have a slightly slick mouthfeel. Moderate
					  carbonation. Smooth. Moderately attenuated (more so than Scottish
					  ales). May have a slight alcohol warmth in stronger versions.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Overall Impression: An easy-drinking pint. Malt-focused with an
					  initial sweetness and a roasted dryness in the finish.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Comments: Sometimes brewed as a lager (if so, generally will not
					  exhibit a diacetyl character). When served too cold, the roasted
					  character and bitterness may seem more elevated.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The criteria also has some examples of beers that you would like if you like this:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Three Floyds Brian Boru Old Irish Ale, Great Lakes Conway’s Irish Ale (a bit strong at 6.5%), Kilkenny Irish Beer, O’Hara’s Irish Red Ale, Smithwick’s Irish Ale, Beamish Red Ale, Caffrey’s Irish Ale, Goose Island Kilgubbin Red Ale, Murphy’s Irish Red (lager), Boulevard Irish Ale, Harpoon Hibernian Ale&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The red color usually comes from certain kinds of caramel malt, which comes in a range of colors but is usually used to make a sweeter, fuller-bodied beer than everyday pale ales and lagers. In this way, they're very similar to amber ale/lagers, and the difference can be very subtle and is very subjective. If you like one, you'll 99% of the time enjoy the other. Most of what you mentioned- like Dos Equis and Yuengling- are marketed as ambers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, I looked up Honest Lager, and Walkerville markets it as Märzen (sometimes but not always the same as Oktoberfest) It's less hoppy and more full-bodied than a Pils or other pale lager, and tends to be reddish or amber in color. If you look a the German/import section of your local beer store or supermarket, you should be able to find an example of something similar, just look for the words "Märzen," "Oktoberfest," "Festbier," etc. A Munich-style Dunkel would also probably be right up your alley. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Key words I would use: sweetish, medium-bodied, balanced, caramelly, toasty. But just think about different foods and aromas while you're drinking, and see what your impression is. Everybody's different.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you do want to use the BJCP guide, just remember that they're designed for judging homebrew competitions, and professional brewers don't have much reason to pay attention to them. So if you pick up a beer and it doesn't match up with its BJCP style, it's not a catastrophe, and the beer is still perfectly good!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As soon as I read "Red Lager" I thought to myself, this guy is probably looking for Vienna Lagers (aka Amber Lagers. For whatever reason beer marketers greatly prefer the term "amber" over "red" when referring to lagers, while using "red" over "amber" when referring to ales eg Red IPA). These are lagers with a slightly sweeter profile than the "standard International pilsner" style churned out by every macrobrewery, due to the addition of Vienna, crystal, and/or caramel malts. Indeed, when looking at the  examples you gave on Rate Beer and Beer Advocate, RB considers both to be of the "Amber Lager/Vienna" style, while BA considers Dos Equis to be a Vienna Lager and Yuengling to be an "American Amber/Red Lager". What's the difference? Generally, the "American" prefix at the start of any beer style means that it's hoppier, due to our lovefest with hops (at least compared to the Old World). Also, RB doesn't break amber lagers into American and not varieties.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can use the &lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beerstyles/amber-lager-vienna/36/" rel="nofollow"&gt;category page on Ratebeer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/30/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Beer Advocate&lt;/a&gt; to browse through more examples of the style. Ratebeer's list is default sorted by rating, which isn't always helpful if you don't live somewhere with a great selection, but you can click on "Count" and it will sort by number of ratings; Beer Advocate's is default sorted by number of reviews. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The two beers you mention are very widely available: On RB, Yuengling is #2 most reviewed and Dos Equis is #7; for rating though neither cracks the top 50. On BA, Dos Equis is the #3 Vienna Lager by reviews and #38 by rating, while Yuengling is the #1 American Amber/Red Lager by reviews and #21 by rating. For some great examples of Vienna/Amber Lagers you might be able to find, Sam Adams Boston Lager is rated #44 on RB and #3 on Beer Advocate (why the big discrepancy? RB users tend to be more heavily biased by the idea that certain breweries aren't "cool", while BA users tend to be more objective).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is always the BJCP guide, which makes the rules that guide most homebrewing and professional contests such as the GABF. The GABF can have real reputation and financial influence for a brewery, so it requires very precise definitions, but outside of competitions most of the brewing world takes the BJCP with a grain of salt (or is it a grain of barley?). Personally, I prefer the Ratebeer and Beer Advocate's style categorizations. Not that they are perfect either - part of the beauty of craft beer is that it is ever-evolving, and brewer creativity knows no category bounds - but it is more democratic and reflective of actual market tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are willing to go a little further afield, you might try a Scottish Ales, like Founders Dirty Bastard (www.ratebeer.com/beer/founders-dirty-bastard-scotch-ale/11498/); a Red IPA (not an official style) such as Troegs Nugget Nectar (www.ratebeer.com/beer/troegs-nugget-nectar-ale/30812/); or even a Bière de Garde, France's only indigenous beer style (these are harder to find, but I bet they have them in Montreal. try www.ratebeer.com/beerstyles/biere-de-garde/58/ or www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/127/.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Common causes for a metallic taste are dissolved metals such as iron or copper, either from the water supply or brewing equipment, or due to the oxidation of fat molecules which can bind with metals.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally though, I find that I can regularly taste metal in the finish of any of a variety of beers that are over-chilled.  I don't recall Belgians being particularly an issue (but I love Belgians and am probably more likely to ensure they're properly temp'ed before drinking) but when served too cold, I can almost guarantee that I'm going to get a strong taste of cold steel right at the end of many brown ales, red ales, and stouts among others, and that it will generally disappear as the beer warms.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Any time you mix things into beer you'll lose some carbonation. Any powder would nucleate bubbles very quickly, so the flavoring should be in liquid form. The liquid should be as similar to beer possible: cold, equally carbonated, and not too much alcohol if it can be avoided. Stir gently in a cold glass and serve right away.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Or, if you are brewing the beer yourself just add it at kegging or bottling time.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are products called Randalizers that can allow you to infuse flavors into beer as it's served. Provided that the beer is 1) on draft, and 2) the flavoring is a solid (hops, peppercorns, citrus peel, etc). An expensive option is the &lt;a href="http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/blichmann-hoprocket.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Blichman Hoprocket&lt;/a&gt;. Another option I've seen, but I'm not sure how to construct it, was an inline water filter that had been modified. That modified filter also required significantly more CO2 to maintain pressure, I don't think that was true of the purpose built devices.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These work well for fresh flavors, but would serve poorly if you were looking for anything else. I've had beers run through a couple different combinations of herbs, fruit, veggies, and hops, and it was always interesting and exciting. Even if it wasn't always that good.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The basic rule is that beers should be served at the temp they were fermented. Lagers should be served at about 40°F and ales around 50°F - 55°F.  Having said this I usually like my beers a little colder on a warm summer day. Try this experiment:  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;chill your beer to 35°F - 40°F and pour about 2/3 of it into the proper glass for that beer. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Drink at least 4 or 5 sips, gulps, or however you typically consume it. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Then put what is left in the microwave for about 20 seconds (time will vary with the output of the microwave).  This will reduce the carbonation some so pour the other third right in the middle of the glass without tipping the glass to get some head, on the beer that is. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It makes a big difference on some beers. less on others. Also try different types of glasses and see what you like. Remember, everybody's palates are different and yours will vary depending on several factors such as, what you've been eating or drinking, how much beer you've already consumed, and how tired you are. It's a good idea to eat a bite or two of good bread like a baguette to cleanse your palate between samples. The above does not apply to mass produced lagers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Guinness is in a style called &lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style13.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;"Dry Irish Stout"&lt;/a&gt;, so anything on &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/162/" rel="nofollow"&gt;this list&lt;/a&gt; would probably substitute well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It sort of depends on what you felt was missing from the cake.  We could work on narrowing it down to stouts that were stronger in those flavors.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Oatmeal or milk stouts as styles would be sweeter than Guinness, some stouts might play up chocolate or coffee or roast/burnt.  Porter is a really similar style that takes well to interesting spice combinations like vanilla and anise.  Bourbon Barrel aged stouts will have a wood/vanilla/whiskey thing going on.  You could make some interesting cakes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beers that are high in ABV, have been bottle-conditioned or have been barrel-aged are prime for aging and cellaring. Usually the brewer will say on the bottle or their website what the max amount of suggested aging time is. For instance, Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout state "develops over 5 years in the bottle." I bought a case of 2012 and have one about every 6 months...and they get better and better.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;They should have been kept at about 50-55 degrees over the time of aging. What did you have them at?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The likely answer is somewhere between carbonation pressure and marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's hard to find numbers for how much caps can handle vs corks but you should notice that most corked beers also come in bottles with very thick glass, this is because the beer inside is at a higher pressure than most other styles.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most beer styles will fall pretty close to 2.0 or 2.5 volumes of CO2 (just the term, think of the number as a relative baseline), but a lot of Belgian strong beers like Bierre de Garde or Tripel will be carbonated with 3.3+ volumes.  Lambics and other sour beers can go up to 4.5 volumes.  This is a linear scale so that becomes possibly twice as much pressure as a normal bottle...so yeah, thicker glass.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;At such high pressure you might find corks will stay put more reliably than a cap since it has more surface area in contact with the bottle.  It also might provide a more airtight seal than a cap for long-term aging.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Those would be technical considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Corking also predated capping so there's also a very traditional feel about a bottle with a cork and a cage, which can fit into the traditional image a lot of breweries market themselves using.  I say I'm not sure and it could just be marketing because a lot of Wheat styles like German Wheats, Belgian Wits, etc are fairly highly carbonated (near the 3.3 volumes range) but most of them have no problems being capped.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As to the affect on taste?  Nada, apart from hypothetical aging concerns...unless mistreated you should not taste the cork.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A cap is not going to fly off a bottle unless it is not properly seated, no matter the carbonation. It is crimped onto the bottle. The bottle will first explode. It is also incorrect that a cork is necessary for higher carbonated beers. Many of the styles identified at higher carbonation volumes also come in capped bottles (particularly 375ml bottles). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Corks do provide a better seal that slows the flow of air into the beer so those bottles will age more slowly than bottles with caps. That is the primary technical difference between the two.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The primary reasons for corking beer today is marketing. In some areas where corked bottles were traditionally used for bottling it was easier to get champagne bottles or similar bottles that could support carbonation and corking became a matter of convenience as it was cheaper to source bottles locally. However, now it is just a matter of marketing the product. All other corked bottles went into large format, corked bottles to make them look like a classier product than a six pack and legitimize higher prices in the customers' eyes. That is true for the beers you find on the market today in almost all cases. Very few beers go into corked bottles because the brewer truly believes it is necessary for the long term quality of the beer in a way that a cap or a cap plus wax would not provide.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's always going to be a matter of preference. I prefer most beers around 55-60 but do not hesitate to drink beer at room temperature. Some styles are more enjoyable approaching room temperature. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Historically, most beer was served at cellar temperature to room temperature, depending upon what was available. That isn't just an English tradition. Any beer can be consumed warm and drinking it ice cold as mass produced lagers are usually served tends to hide most of the flavor that you are paying for in a good beer. Give it a try and see what you like. Maybe you don't like your beer a little warmer. Enjoy what you like.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just wanted to add to some of the already great answers…&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Although it has been mentioned what the characteristics of Nitro are, and why that might be good for the beer drinking experience, it hasn't really been said why to use it or rather why its used in lieu of CO2. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It was mentioned that the historical carbonation process was very different, but nobody has connected the two, so I figure I'll add a little input to hopefully color in a bit more. A lot of the reason for carbonation is to preserve the beer. By replacing the oxygen in the keg the beer will last longer. Now we associate the carbonation with beer but that was not always there traditionally. While it is true that older beer bottled from barrel storage was carbonated during bottling it wasn't mentioned that historically beer was poured from the cask and therefore not carbonated beyond natural carbonation. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cask&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In this string cask beer wasn't mentioned but it is literally from the barrel. It is the smoothest and creamiest way to "tap" beer. It's also considered the best by many purists. It however has a huge limitation in modern applications. The barrels don't last as long and thereby need to be smaller, swapped out more often, and potentially wasted if not used quick enough. For this reason most businesses opt for the larger, easier, cheaper carbonated kegs. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As stated before by Jeffrey Lin the Nitro is a newer solution but I have to take exception to his explanation of the unnatural side of Nitro. Really the purists are fine with nitro. They may not be particularly fond of the "in-can" nitro widget, but really the process just replaces a larger CO2 bubble with the smaller finer bubbles of dissolved nitrogen and thereby some dissolved C02 as well. Purists truly would be more likely to enjoy a cask pour but as Nitro, in a lot of ways, is closer to cask both in consistency and the "creaminess" described it goes without saying this would be enjoyed by the purists as well. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of Beer for Nitro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are many types of beer where smooth finer bubbles are appropriate. Guinness being only one that comes to mind but really most British milds. Also English ales, pales and creams just to mention a few. The older styles from England were flat compared to American lagers and most modern beers. Another good example is a Boddingtons. Finer bubbles fit the mold with anything that traditionally would be served from the cask. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As with most new technology it serves a purpose and in this case the purpose is two-fold. Store without oxygen to prevent going bad, and keep with the original intended style of those types of beers. The discussion of flavor change is slightly off because flavor change would only be present if oxygen were allowed to be present in the beer when kegged. Texture change is more accurate and the nitro is an effort to more closely approximate that. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hope that is helpful to fill in some details and thanks to Sloloem for helping, hopefully it is more easily digestable/readable? It may not be science but historically speaking it might be philosophy…&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The malt is providing the sweetness and the hops are providing the bitterness plus the lingering flavour.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Depending on what type malted grains the beer is brewed will effect its sweetness. This is due to how much fermentatble sugar can be extracted from the grains, any non-fermentable sugars will stay in the beer and provide effect how the beer sweetness. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hops are used in different stages of the brewing process to provide different functions.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hops are added at the intial point of the boiling process (which is usually about 60mins) - The hops oils released from the hops at this stage provide the beer with head retention, bitterness and also natural perservative. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hops are then again added during the final stage of the boiling process (last 10-15mins) - At this point the hops are providing the lingering taste that you are noting, plus any aroma notes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's sort of tough to chase down the origins of this stuff.  It likely grew out of wine competition judging, which itself may have been based on the internal QA process of breweries and wineries.  But that's conjecture, I can't find anything concrete.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The best information I've got is that the websites like BA and RateBeer use the criteria set down by the American Homebrewers' Association and the Beer Judge Certification Program (AHA/BJCP).  The BJCP was formed in 1985, but their style descriptions were likely based on Michael Jackson's famous book: The World Guide To Beer, published in 1977.  But realistically it just sort of makes sense...describe how it looks, how it smells, how it tastes, how fizzy/thick/thin it feels, and then any ephemeral qualities it has to give an impression of the beer.  Pretty much covers all the bases.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I visited the brewery of West-Malle, Belgium recently.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Glass vs bottle or can will be a pretty noticeable difference with most styles of beer simply due to the size of the opening.  When you pour from the storage vessel to the glass you disturb the beer a lot which drives CO2 gas out, and that takes a lot of aromatics with it so the aroma you get from the beer in a glass is WAY stronger and more complex than what you'd sniff from the bottle or can.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also smell is a pretty huge part of tasting something and when you drink from a glass you're putting your nose right into the thick of all that, so the flavor will be more intense as well.  Bottles and cans sort of keep that toned down since you don't smell the beer as much.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There used to be a prejudice against cans because the liquid and the aluminum would react and oxidize, but they started coating the insides with a food safe epoxy resin decades ago and it's completely sealed now.  As far as taste goes there's no difference between the two, but cans actually store a bit better because they let in no light and no air while bottles will eventually let through enough to affect the beer.  Brewers like cans as well since they're more portable, don't shatter, chill faster, and are often cheaper to fill.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as I've ever tried, old beers, even cheap light lager like Bud Light, will taste pretty off after a lot of in-bottle or can aging. The older it is, the worse it will taste, but having drunk more than one in a sitting, I can safely say it's no more harmful than drinking a fresh one. Never gotten sick off one, but it's pretty hard to down them without gagging a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some beers actually seem to intentionally go for a similar taste. Anything with a green bottle seems to be trying for a skunky flavor, while brown bottles help filter out damaging light. Compare a Beck's or Heineken to, say, a Budweiser.  The former will have a distinctly skunky flavor to them, basically similar to marijuana. The latter has a bit of a rice taste, as that's what's used in the brewing process, with a slight sweetness, but overall just a bubbly light flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As Linus pointed out, there's going to be a "wet cardboard" taste with past-due light lagers. I'm guessing this is due to the breakdown of oils and sugars in the beer, as well as other general chemical changes. I'm not sure why it has that taste of cardboard or paper, but it's definitely present. After doing some research (aka looking it up on google), I found that the main culprit of that cardboard taste is a chemical called "nonenal". It's apparently also a chemical in human body odor of aged people, leading to the so-called "old people smell". This isn't proven, but there's some evidence that this is the main culprit for the somewhat-neutral scent of older people's perspiration. In a beer, not quite as neutral, however.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would add that beer that tends to last longer in a can because of way it's sealed.  No bottle cap for leaking oxygen and light can't penetrate so it's not going to be ruined as fast when it's sitting in the store fridge under the fluorescent lights&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Two types of beers might suit you, both are similar but with slightly different flavour profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;English mild ale has a lower alcoholic content than bitter or Guinness, generally dark coloured.  Theakstons make a particularly nice mild on an irregular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Scottish 60 shilling (60/-) or light beer is similar to mild but is generally slightly sweeter to suit the Scottish palate.  McEwan's 60/- is the one most commonly seen.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that this class of beer is generally out of favour in the UK despite efforts by the Campaign for Real Ale to revive interest.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Let's start off with beers that you're interested in, something akin to a black lager. I'm going to keep things focused on beer styles rather than particulars, since I do not know where you are nor what might be available for you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Dunkelweizen&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is a dark wheat beer with characteristics of a traditional wheat with caramel type flavors joining the mix. Not exactly stout-like, but more like your black lager in lightness.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Schwarzbier&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Schwarzbier means "black beer" in German. This is what you had with your  Köstritzer. It is a medium-bodied, malt-accented dark brew, very opaque and deep-sepia in color, with a chewy texture and a firm, creamy, long-lasting head. In spite of its dark color, it comes across as a soft and elegant brew that is rich, mild, and surprisingly balanced. It never tastes harsh, toasty or acrid.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Black IPA / Cascadian Dark Ale&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The American fascination with hops has shown that the addition of toasted malts can give a hoppy, bitter, and coffee-like experience to these beers. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Black Saisons&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Similar to the Black IPA, I've seen a few breweries start brewing their saisons with roasted malts. The usual light flavors of the saison are accented by this extra roasted character. It's never acrid, however. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Porters&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A lot of English porters are not heavy at all, and are generally akin to milds that have roasted malts added in. Look for lower ABV porters in the 4-5% range, and you'll probably find something you like.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly to many, Guinness is actually &lt;a href="http://time.com/25145/3-surprising-facts-about-guinness/"&gt;on par with any other beer of similar alcohol strength&lt;/a&gt;, as beer gets a majority of its calories from alcohol, &lt;a href="https://www.uhs.uga.edu/documents/nutrition_alcohol.pdf"&gt;about 7 per gram&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps much of the 'full' feeling is a product of the use of nitrogen in the mix which gives it that creamy texture. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some breweries use a hop "Torpedo", where the beer is forced through a chamber containing the desired aroma hops:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://byo.com/hops/item/1899-torpedoes-away" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://byo.com/hops/item/1899-torpedoes-away&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I saw on Zythos Beer Festival in Leuven (Belgium) where they have a hop chamber (in glass) where the beer is going through when drafting into a glass.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thenobleexperiment.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/hopfilter3.jpg" rel="nofollow"&gt;Similar like this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is a simple question to ask but has a longer answer with a ton of complexities you probably don't care about if you are not brewing your own.  Ultimately sweet beers are part of the style they are in so avoiding sugary sweet beers is as simple as knowing the styles.  You can skip to the bottom if that's all you want to know.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are two types of sweetness that are often discussed and sometimes confused in beer, a Malty flavor and a Sweet flavor. The same ingredients are involved but in different ways.  Sugary sweet beers basically come from unfermented sugars which simply means sugars that the yeast hasn't processed to create alcohol and carbon dioxide.  This is also called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation_(brewing)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;attenuation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This can be caused by a few different things such as unfermentable sugars that come from the way the beer is mashed (when the grains are mixed in with hot water and left to sit for a specific length of time) or from specialty grains, or the yeast itself.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The explanation of how the mash affects sweetness is very complex and full of biochemistry.  I will try to summarize.  Grains are full of starches that need to be converted to sugar for the yeast to ferment.  There are two main enzymes involved in this process, alpha and beta amylase enzymes.  Using a branched tree analogy works great.  After a strong storm you need to clean up your yard from the limbs that have fallen from the trees.  You have a lopper (alpha amylase) which is great for cutting the branches apart from the limbs but still leave you with long branches and twigs.  You also have a chipper (beta amylase) which is good at taking the branches and twigs and cutting them into little pieces that are easy to use.  The two enzymes need to do their work together to make the most fermentable sugars out of the starches stored in the grains.  Alpha amylase is good at breaking the limbs apart into long starch chains but these are not easy for yeast to ferment.  Beta amylase is great at making small glucose chains that the yeast can convert but the big limbs are too big to get into the chipper, if the alpha amylase doesn't do its job first the beta amylase cant do its job well.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The kicker is each enzyme works in a specific temperature range (beta amylase 131-150°F and alpha amylase 154-162°F).  A brewer can manipulate the mash temperature to ensure both enzymes are working with an overlapping temperature (for instance 152°F) or adjust the temperature up or down to accentuate one enzyme over the other.  For instance if we mashed at 158°F the beta amylase will denature and not affect the beer, while the alpha amylase will be very happy and busy.  This will result in more long starch molecules in the beer which are harder for yeast to ferment and result in a sweeter beer!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Unfermentable sugars can also come from specialty grains added to the beer for flavor and intentional sweetness.  The usual suspects are roasted grains where the sugars inside the grain will start to caramelize such as Dark caramel and roasted malts like Crystal 80, Crystal 120, Special B, Chocolate Malt, and Roast Barley.  Below is a great place for people to start learning the intricacies of brewing beer at home.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.howtobrew.com/section4/chapter20-1.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Increasing the Body&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ultimately these things are done by brewers to make their beer fit into the style they are trying to make along with other things like the amount and type of hops used and other adjuncts (stuff added to beer like fruit or rice or...)  So to avoid sugary beers you mainly need to know what styles are not sweet or its as simple as saying know what types of beers you like.  If you really want to learn the styles turn to the Beer Style Guide!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/catdex.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;2008 BJCP Style Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Look around and see which are sweet and avoid, meanwhile look for highly attenuated beers.  Id expect some you would like are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;German Pilsners&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;American Lagers and Pilsners&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Berliner-Style Weisse&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Dunkel Weizen/Dunkel Weissbier&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Munich Helles&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Belgian-Style Pale Strong Ale&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Pale Ales shouldn't be too sweet&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Kölsch&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;IPAs should be dry&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you want to be adventurous try a Wood- and Barrel-Aged Sour Beer.  They are supposed to be dry although I can't speak from experience.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is a couple years behind the topic.  What the heck.  I've got 3 aluminum long neck bud's, Not that light stuff either, from 2006.  I'm straining them through a coffee filter just in case.  1st thing I noticed was the color. Much darker than a new bud.  2nd is the smell.  Strong alcohol smell you don't get with beer.  Makes me wonder if fermentation was still active at a later point.  Wish I had a way of checking the alcohol lv.  After about 20 oz consumed I'll have a close enough guess.  Waiting til after work around 11 or 12.  I'll put in an update.  9 year old beer.  This sounds like fun.&lt;/p&gt;

But really, describe it however it tastes to you even if the word isn't commonly used in beer tasting.

					&lt;p&gt;The heavier beers (ABV 6.5% +) tend to have a sweeter taste as the alcohol increases. Alcohol may add a bit of sweetness to a beer, but it is mostly due to the amount of malt used to increase the alcohol of the beer. Note: Certain styles, like the Belgian Strong Ales, also tend to have sugar added. Sometimes this may lead to a sweeter beer, but the beer (usually) should finish dry.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer that is cloyingly sweet after you finished your sip is usually not well fermented.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the stout style you also get Sweet Stout that is made to be sweeter using lactose (milk sugar) which is unfermentable.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You judge a beer based on visual, aroma, taste, mouthfeel; and descriptive terms generally fall into these categories. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Visually you might describe the color of the brew (amber, golden, inky black, hazy, clear), the color and retention of the head, how the beer poured. Aroma might be described by smell of hops (floral, citrusy, resiny, piney, etc.), or malts (caramel, toffee, smoke, chocolate, etc), or other aromas present (molasses, booze, soy sauce, oak).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Describing taste opens up even more potential terminology, but don't be shy to use whatever terms or comparisons best describe the flavor for you. Think of tasting beer as an evolution of flavor in your mouth: describe how it hits your tongue; how the flavor builds, morphs, and leaves; and the aftertaste. You might use any word you would to describe the flavors of food and more to describe beer (Sweet, salty, sour, tangy, raisins, dough, bread, bacon, spicy, herbal, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finally, for mouthfeel, you're looking at words describing the texture and consistency; so ones like smooth, rich, chalky, gritty, effervescent, thick, syrupy, etc., are very useful when appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most people would say yes, it does make a difference. Take a read of this article for some thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2014/07/11/can-this-glass-actually-make-beer-taste-better/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2014/07/11/can-this-glass-actually-make-beer-taste-better/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The type of glass can effect not only the aromas imparted to your nose but also how quickly the beer warms up and also the visual appeal too. I tell people you first taste things with your eyes, then your nose, then your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer is not always bitter, but the bitterness (usually from the hops) is there to counter the sweetness of the malt.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some beers, like the Belgian Strong Ales, tend to be malty &amp;amp; sweet, with just enough bitterness to but the sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beers become sweeter with age, as the hops (and the bitterness) drop out, leaving only the malty sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Gruit (beers made without hops) use different herbs to give bitterness to the beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There was a lexicon written, but it does not seem that it ever made it to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Trained tasters have fairly similar tastes, as that is what makes them so important. Thus they will know the difference between roasty, coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, white chocolate, coffee with milk, latte.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The beer descriptors (I think) are a lot more down to earth. (To quote CBR) If beer had a wine vocabulary, we would say simcoe is feline, as opposed to cat piss! :p&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Listen to podcasts like Dr Homebrew, Brewing With Style and Craft Beer Radio. They rate the beers, providing amazing insight to the vocabulary of a beer judge as well as the judging process.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is rather hard to say what should be in beer making as much of beer making is just a exercise in the personals taste of the brewer but yes a certain level of bitterness is required to counter act the sugars that need to be present for fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So I'm going to assume you mean historically...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_beer" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; has a ton of good info but basically, beer was originally a very sweet beverage due to the wild yeast and under modified malt that was used in the brewing process.  To combat the sweetness, brewers would use &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruit" rel="nofollow"&gt;Gruit&lt;/a&gt; which is an herb mixture to bitter the beer. &lt;a href="http://www.beerscenemag.com/2010/04/the-short-and-bitter-history-of-hops/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Hops were also used as a bittering agent&lt;/a&gt;, but not to the same extent as gruit.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In 1842, the first &lt;a href="http://braukaiser.com/wiki/index.php?title=German_Brewing_between_1850_and_1900_:_Malting_and_Wort_Production" rel="nofollow"&gt;Pilsner&lt;/a&gt; was brewed, a style which showcases hops and is very pale in color which was revolutionary at the time.  This style took Europe by storm and the &lt;a href="http://www.craftbeer.com/the-beverage/history-of-beer/the-american-story" rel="nofollow"&gt;migrating Germans&lt;/a&gt; to the US brought this taste for hoppy pilsners with them to the US.  There were many competing styles that were popular in the US up until Prohibition.
					 After prohibition, the breweries that were still in business chose to produce the beers that appeal to the widest consumer base, I.E. Pilsner drinkers. This is the raison d'etre for the very large breweries.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for the bitterness in beer, the most common factor is &lt;a href="http://www.craftbeer.com/craft-beer-muses/birth-of-a-hop" rel="nofollow"&gt;Hops&lt;/a&gt;.  Hops contain different acids (&lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/cep/HopVarieties.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alpha, Beta, Myrcente, etc)&lt;/a&gt; that bitter beer in different ways.  The type, quantity and usage of hops in the brewing process can affect the bitterness of beer.
					That being said, some styles don't use a lot of hops if at all.  Scottish/Irish ales, for instance, don't have much hop flavor due to the lack of &lt;a href="http://www.realbeer.com/library/authors/tierney-jones-a/scottishales.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;availability of hops in the region&lt;/a&gt;.  Other styles originate from locations that have &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicha" rel="nofollow"&gt;never seen hops&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps.  Never be afraid to try new things.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In general, beers that are served with nitro tend to be smoother than their CO2 counterpart. Personally, I've had Left Handed Milk Stout Nitro and Standard side by side and much preferred the Nitro version.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_glassware" rel="nofollow"&gt;Beer glasses&lt;/a&gt; are mainly a product of the region in which the beer was originated and therefore tied to a specific beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Belgian beers - Normally served in &lt;a href="http://www.ohio.com/polopoly_fs/1.457872!/image/image.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_500/hullabaloo.png" rel="nofollow"&gt;goblets&lt;/a&gt; because the beers have very complex aromas and the shape of the glass can help present and concentrate them for consumption.&lt;/li&gt;

Simply a glass that is easier to hold in the hand whilst standing around the pub. Normally associated with most British ales.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Pilsner - High sided &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=images&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjb2qXFspTKAhUW7mMKHQyeCAsQjRwIAw&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FKitchen-Tall-Beer-Glasses-14-4oz-410ml%2Fdp%2FB00BMGWVBC&amp;amp;psig=AFQjCNEgUeJUiOw0x1O2jGuwy-cLwqvEUg&amp;amp;ust=1452142510579203" rel="nofollow"&gt;flute&lt;/a&gt; to concentrate the hop aroma and show off the high carbonation of Pilsners.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weissbeir - German wheat beers are usually served in &lt;a href="http://transatlanticbrews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Craft-beer-glasses-at-Joes-Wine-Cellar.jpg" rel="nofollow"&gt;tall glasses&lt;/a&gt; to show off the cloudy beer and also the creamy tall head of foam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It might sound snobbish to be peckish about the type of glass but the glass does influence the taste of the beer. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some things are:
					 - the thickness of the glass. A thin glass invites to a more delicate way of drinking, a really thick glass would let you expect a sturdier beer.
					 - the surface compared to the volume of beer. A big surface gives a change to let of more aroma's but I would think you also need a little more foam.
					 - the capacity to keep the aroma's. As pointed out by Rube. Think of a cognac glass versus a &lt;a href="http://www.bierwoordenboek.com/getfile.aspx?file=Glazen%2FAmsterdammer.gif" rel="nofollow"&gt;vase&lt;/a&gt;. Some glasses also take in you nose deeper than others.
					 - the way the beer flows. The shape of the glass how quickly you can drink it without spilling. Think of &lt;a href="http://www.potjebier.nl/bier_glazen.asp?f=show&amp;amp;id=14" rel="nofollow"&gt;kwak&lt;/a&gt;, you HAVE to drink the last very carefully.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So to answer your question: there are many factors how the glass influences how you taste a beer. What's best is very subjective. You could at first stick to the opinion of the brewer, what he finds the best glass for it. If you like the taste with an other glass better, use that. I would not approach this as a hard science. Brewers might choose a specific glass to "stand out".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a Belgian I am always told by bartenders and brewers that for special (heavy) Belgian beers a Tulip glass is a good choice, except for Belgian Lambics (nl:Lambieken) for which one should use a flute glass. These glasses are sometimes  scratched at the bottom to better accommodate the bubbling (for example: Duvel Glasses)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would say some are sweeter, some aren't. Brewers do kick up the mount of malt in IIPA's to get the ABV up there. This could lead to a sweeter taste depending on the malt bill and fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yeast can just process a certain amount of sugar inside the mash and therefore in double IPA there can be more sugar left in the beer, depending on the yeast that is used.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To be classified as a double IPA it must have an ABV &gt;= 7.5%.  That requires more malt/sugar.  However, the perceived sweetness can be a factor from yeast used and the Bitterness Ratio: &lt;a href="http://www.madalchemist.com/chart_bitterness_ratio.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.madalchemist.com/chart_bitterness_ratio.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I assume you're talking about the &lt;a href="http://www.erdinger.de/en/erdinger-weissbier-products/beer/weissbier.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Erdinger hefeweissbier&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a good example of the beer style known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_beer" rel="nofollow"&gt;German-style wheat beer&lt;/a&gt; / BJCP category 15A.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It also goes by the names: Weizen, Weissbier (Weißbier), Wheat beer, etc. etc.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Lots of German breweries produce great examples of this style of beer: Weihenstephan, Franziskaner, Schneider, Aying.  I believe that if you like Erdinger, many of these companies' wheat beers will be to your liking.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;IMHO the closet to Erdinger Hefeweissbier would be from Franziskaner (obviously this is a very subjective assertion, YMMV).  It would be interesting to line some of these up for a taste-difference test.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But you may be able to find German-style wheat beers brewed in many other countries.  Do not be confused with an "American Style Wheat-beer" / BJCP Category 6D.  This is a significantly different sort of beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Given your liking of these sorts of beers, you might also enjoy Belgian style wheat beers, collectively known as Witbier.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown a correlation between a foods presentation and the perceived goodness of the taste.  So even excepting the usual reasons for matching a beer style to a glass style (head retention, aroma dispersal, etc.), presenting a beer in a good looking vessel will enhance its taste.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer and food pairings have an entire subculture, not unlike wine. On both &lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/Forums/Forum-7.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Ratebeer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/community/forums/beer-food.40/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Beer Advocate&lt;/a&gt;, there are entire forums dedicated to beer and food pairing. Honestly, there are an infinite number of combinations.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One thing I've heard is that a lot of chefs really like pale lagers. Not because the pale lagers themselves are all that amazing (personally, I'm not a fan of them), but they present a neutral palate, which allows them to pair well with most dishes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally, two of my favorite pairings are hoppy IPAs with spicy food, and imperial stouts with desserts (especially if they are chocolate-based). IPAs complement the spice and help cut the heat of the spicy food. And the dark roastiness of the imperial stouts really complements the sweetness of dessert.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The infographic below is from &lt;a href="http://www.craftbeer.com/food/pairing/pairing-chart" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;craftbeer.com&lt;/a&gt; and contains their recommendations on food and beer pairing. I tend to like what it suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Tequila has come a long way from when it was 1st manufactured, back in the day the traditional way to drink tequila was in a shot glass because it actually did taste like you were drinking paint stripper!... this is not the case anymore, now some tequila is drank from wide mouth cups and sipped like wine or a really nice bourbon. Contrary to popular belief tequila doest always give you the craziest hang over, at least not the newer tequilas since they are better quality, that is, if you are drinking &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt; tequila. Real tequila is made from the agave plant and depending on the region grown in Mexico ( south, north) will have a slight different taste. Sometimes you may find tequilas that say &lt;em&gt;mixto&lt;/em&gt; or mixed, &lt;strong&gt;stay away&lt;/strong&gt; from these types since they are not pure tequila and should not be drank without mixing it in a cocktail or mix drink. This mixto tequila will not taste as good and will give you a crappy headache the next day. There are different types of aging process for tequilas. There is the silver, gold or aged and extra aged, all have distinct flavors and undertones. Here is a good &lt;a href="http://tequilaconnection.com/index.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; with some tequila information and history also for tasting.
					So if the bottle says &lt;em&gt;mixed&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;mixto&lt;/em&gt; then it's for mixing and should not be drank alone unless you want to feel like a truck hit you the next day.
					Any other kind of &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; tequila should be ok, it all depends on taste and preference. 
					Just remember that the first swig you take &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; suppose to &lt;strong&gt;burn&lt;/strong&gt;, lol enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is just my opinion&lt;/em&gt;, but on a personal note, patron is over hyped and you can find way
					Better quality tequilas at a better price. I personally like casamigos the brand by George clooney it's actually pretty good, also &lt;em&gt;Don Julio&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Herradura&lt;/em&gt;  are good.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A general rule when it comes to liquor is that if it's a cheap, generic version of it's type then it's probably better mixed into a cocktail. This is because the cocktail masks the poor quality of the liquor, but you still get the kick of the alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if it's a high quality version of the liquor then the reason you should buy that liquor is for its own merits. For instance, I'd never buy a 100 dollar bottle of Scotch and mix it with ginger-ale, would be a big waste of money.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, alcohol is subjective so if you like drinking a cheap tequila straight that's your prerogative. In general, which you mix and which you drink straight is a matter of your own taste and research on what's a 'good' tequila.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For the most part more expensive tequila is better. For drinking go with 100% agave. For drinking most people prefer gold.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For margaritas mid to low end tequila seems to be just fine (I can't tell the difference). I think fresh squeezed lime does more for a margarita than expensive tequila. Most people prefer silver in margaritas.  I went to a party once and the guy was serving Patron and a margaritas mix - I was like dude time to skip the mix.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The big names are good but they also charge a premium.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Guinness can taste slightly different and have a different head based on where it's coming from. A big factor in this is how long the beer you're getting has been in the keg. People in Ireland drink Guinness a lot more than in the states, so kegs are replaced more frequently i.e. fresher beer. This is why if you go to a bar in Ireland and not a lot of people are drinking Guinness, you shouldn't get one. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another possible reason you've heard this is that most people visit Dublin when they're in Ireland and have a pint at the Guinness store house. They ensure all the beer there is top of the line and it really is much better there than any other place I've had it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a few questions here, so let me address them individually:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Guinness Draft, the "standard" Guinness is not always brewed in Ireland, so that may be one reason for a different taste in Ireland than in US. As gannolly commented, the age of the beer also affects the taste, as well as the cleanliness of the beerline (if the beer is on tap).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Guinness has a few beers, one of their biggest beers is a Foreign Extra Stout. This is brewed in various counties. This is a higher ABV, roastier beer. I think it has double the ABV of a "standard" Guinness.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One other important fact is emotions. If I am sitting in the Guinness Brewery, looking out over Dublin, drinking a fresh, perfectly poured Guinness, I am in a very happy place. This happiness will affect my overall experience of the beer. If you take that same keg, keep it cool and fly it overnight to the US and taste it there, it will still be good, but it will not be &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; good, because you are missing the experience. This said, the beer can also be just as good, because you remember the feeling of drinking that beer in Dublin.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here are links to the various Guinness Breweries and the beers that are brewed there.

					&lt;p&gt;In foreign countries, a particular brand of beer is often produced under a licence to a local brewer.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The accuracy with which these local brewers reproduce the original beer varies greatly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For example, Australians noticed a change in the local Guinness when the local licensee changed from CUB to Lion recently: &lt;a href="http://www.news.com.au/national/south-australia/lion-brews-the-first-guinness-in-south-australia-in-40-years/story-fndo4dzn-1226508692750" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.news.com.au/national/south-australia/lion-brews-the-first-guinness-in-south-australia-in-40-years/story-fndo4dzn-1226508692750&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Generally, the longer it's barrel aged, the more drinkable it is.  Anejo tequila is aged longest (I believe at least a year, but keep me honest).  Reposado is aged a bit less (6 months or so), and Blanco is generally not aged for any significant time.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can usually see it in the color of the tequila as well, (though many cheap tequilas are pretty amber in color, but certainly not aged very long or well, so this isn't a great measure of how good it is).  Blancos, as their name suggests, tend to be clear in color, Anejos can have a very deep, nearly brown color.  Reposados start to show some of the characteristics of a good tequila (pepper, etc), and Anejos can be downright complex.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I suggest that you don't drink Blancos straight.  Reposados can be good sipped and are great mixed, and are a good price point.  Most Anejos would be wasted as a mixed drink, and should be sipped.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not sure but Heineken used to be more bitter in the seventies and eighties.  It was really a better tasting beer back then.  Very refreshing when it was hot.  Now it tastes like everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a number of reasons why you may perceive Becks as more bitter.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Firstly, some of the bitterness you are perceiving is a factor of the beer's age.  Beers like Becks, Heineken, Amstel, Yuengling, Miller/Coors/Budweiser, etc. aren't as strongly hopped as IPAs.  Nonetheless, hops are still the primary flavoring agent in these beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some background first.  Hops are flowers.  Their bitter flavor comes from the release of the flower's alpha acids, which are among the most prominent resins and volatile oils within the flower itself.  These alpha acids are extremely sensitive to oxygen and begin to break down upon exposure to oxygen -- even the trace amounts inside a sealed bottle or keg.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Thus, any beer relying on hops as a primary flavoring agent is essentially "on the clock" from the time it's brewed.  When fresh (&amp;lt;30 days after bottling/kegging), these hops taste as they were intended.  As time progresses, the hop flavors fade and are replaced by a skunky hop flavor which some people (myself included) perceive as being overly bitter.  Advanced palates can distinguish between these flavors, but it's often difficult to separate them without proper training.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Additionally, most mass-market beers (including all of the above) are pasteurized.  Anything that's been pasteurized will have a shelf life.  General guidelines are to avoid anything older than ~90 days for pasteurized beer, and try to find &amp;lt;30 days when possible.  I check bottling dates religiously before making a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Note that some types of unpasteurized beer (Ex: traditional Belgian lambic) actually &lt;em&gt;improve&lt;/em&gt; with age and can be cellared under proper conditions for upwards of 30 years!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another reason is due to the Heineken flavor profile itself.  Just as alpha acids are sensitive to oxygen, the malted grain in beer is quite sensitive to direct sunlight.  Even 15-20 minutes of exposure to the sun can irreparably skunk a beer.  This is why most beer bottles are dark in color and 6pk holders have high cardboard sides.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Even though both Becks and Heineken are sold in green bottles, which allow significantly more light through than dark bottles, the Heineken flavor profile is decidedly more skunky.  And that's not to say it's bad; it's simply part of the flavor profile they have nurtured.  This skunky malt flavor is the dominant flavor in Heineken, and it frequently masks some of the underlying hop bitterness -- including bitterness from aged hops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you want to see what this flavor tastes like, grab two cans of Bud/Miller/Coors Light.  Pour one into a clear glass and put it in direct sunlight for 15-20 minutes.  Pour the other one at the same time but leave it in an opaque container shielded from sunlight.  It's a pretty distinctive flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finally, everyone's tastebuds perceive flavors a little differently.  It's entirely possible that another person tasting the same two beers from the exact same bottles comes to a different conclusion about bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In short, there are a number of factors at play here, and it may require a bit of effort to isolate them.  But hey, that's the fun part!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can find a discussion about it &lt;a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/community/threads/beers-similar-to-weihenstephaner-hefeweissbier-dunkel.81764/" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A couple of US brewed beers that arise from it are Sierra Nevada Kellerweis and Sly Fox Royal Weiss; but if you'd prefer a more easy-going (and usually cheaper solution), I'd go with &lt;a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/4477/13892/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Gösser Dark&lt;/a&gt; - although it's not make in the US (but in Austria) it's widespread across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Erdinger Urweisse and Erdinger Hefeweissbier should also be close. Both are brewed in Erding (roughly 15 miles from Weihenstephan), but reportedly available throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Try to make a tea out of the hops.
					Put a flower or a pellet in a mug,
					Pour boiling water over it,
					Wait for 10 minutes,
					Taste,
					Make notes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Try to get hold of some samples of hops at local or regional (home)brewers.
					Most likely they will be happy to help out a fellow brewer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Water does a fair job of dissolving the aromatic compounds in hops but the resinous or oily compounds will dissolve better in ethanol. To get a really clean extract of hops, steep fresh or dry hops in vodka or neutral grain spirits, then filter and dilute with water for tasting. The straight extract can be overwhelming. A really good extract will be a milky yellow color.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, try adding the extract to an un-hopped beer to to see how the flavor changes when mixed with other ingredients. When hops are boiled in the wort during brewing, the heat can cause chemical reactions between the aromatics and other ingredients, giving the brew a slightly different flavor than the uncooked flavor of the extracts.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;We grow hops and my husband loves IPAs so he makes these hop extracts to mix with beer and cocktails.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sour_beer" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wiki page on Sour Beer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"[S]our beers are made by intentionally allowing wild yeast strains or bacteria into the brew. Traditionally, Belgian brewers allowed wild yeast to enter the brew naturally through the barrels or during the cooling of the wort in a coolship open to the outside air – an unpredictable process that many modern brewers avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The most common agents used to intentionally sour beer are Lactobacillus, Brettanomyces, and Pediococcus. Another method for achieving a tart flavor is adding fruit during the aging process to spur a secondary fermentation or contribute microbes present on the fruit's skin."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wild Turkey American Honey is excellent with most kinds of tea including black, green, and orange pekoe.  Throw in a squeeze of lemon for an delicious, easy to make, and modern twist on the Hot Toddy.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.americanhoney.com/age-gate.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wild Turkey American Honey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another alcohol that pairs well with tea is tea flavored vodka.  There are lots of different brands of this such as Firefly and Jeremiah Weed, and typically in bars they are paired with iced tea, they work equally well with hot tea.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finally, Fireball or other Cinnamon Whiskeys go well with Tea also, but they can often overpower less potent teas.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are several things going on here.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;1) Temperature absolutely plays a difference in beer taste. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Too Cold&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The biggest issue with beer served too cold is the way the temperature masks many flavors and aromas. The cold temperature slows the volatilization of aromatic compounds causing them to linger in the beer. When these compounds are not released, it dramatically changes the apparent flavor and aroma of the beer, sometimes to the point where it may come across as thin and tasteless. (&lt;a href="https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;American Homebrewers Association&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Too Hot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Warm beer, on the other hand, does allow for more of the flavors and aromas to come to the forefront, but as beer approaches room temperature the sensations from hop bitterness and carbonation can decrease, which can lead to an almost flat-tasting experience. (&lt;a href="https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;American Homebrewers Association&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So here are suggested temperatures for serving various types of beer. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;....................&lt;strong&gt;Beer&lt;/strong&gt; ................................. &lt;strong&gt;Suggested  Temperature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;American Mainstream Light Lagers...............     33° – 40° F / 1° – 5° C&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Pale Lagers, Pilsners ...................................   38° – 45° F /  3° – 8° C&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Cream &amp;amp; Blonde Ales     ...................................40° – 45° F / 5° – 8° C&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Nitro Stouts    ...................................................40° – 45° F / 5° – 8° C&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Belgian Pale Ales, Abbey Tripels    ..................40° – 45° F / 5° – 8° C&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wheat Beers     ................................................40° – 50° F / 5° – 10° C&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Lambics     .......................................................40° – 50° F / 5° – 10° C&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Dark Lagers     .................................................45° – 50° F / 7° – 10° C&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;American Pale Ales &amp;amp; IPAs   .........................45° – 50° F / 7° – 10° C&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Stouts, Porters     ............................................45° – 55° F / 7° – 13° C&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Strong Lagers   .............................................50° – 55° F / 10° – 13° C&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Real &amp;amp; Cask Ales ...................................... 50° – 55° F / 10° – 13° C&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Belgian Dubbels     .........................................50° – 55° F / 10° – 13° C&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					Data from Tasting Beer by Randy Mosher.&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;2) Glassware makes a HUGE difference. The shape allows for nucleation sites, temperature control of beer, aromatic release/retention. (See /user/MDMA's full response to my question about glassware and beer &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/a/311/22"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;3) What type of beer is it? If it is a nano brewery, it could be several things (wild yeast, inconsistency in brewing process, fermentation time, bourbon barrels stored in, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;4) What was your drinking environment the first time/subsequent times you drank? Have you ever eaten somewhere for the first time while starving and with good friends you haven't seen in a while? That food will forever be amazing in your mind. You go back years later with a normal appetite and people you see regularly and the experience can be very different.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There's a good chance it's got to do with UV light. The chemical compound in hops that makes them bitter (isohumulones) can produce something called 3-MBT (3-methylbut-2-ene-1-thiol) when sunlight hits it. 3-MBT will make your beer taste skunky. A noticeable change in flavor will start to occur really quickly, within seconds of direct sunlight. If the bottle you had was green or clear, those allow light in, so they're susceptible to this effect. If the cup of beer you had came from a keg....the almighty keg is impervious. Additionally, any beer that you drink outside can be affected. Bitter beers like IPAs will suffer faster and more noticeably because they have more isohumulones. Though, this doesn't happen to all beers. Some of the bigger breweries, like Miller, use a stabilized hop extract that won't produce MBT.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The takeaway, if you don't like the skunk, drink beer from dark bottles or cans when outside. And more importantly, if some beer snob irritates you, give them hell for destroying the flavor profile of their expensive beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Pouring the beer is going to lose some of the carbonation.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also you smell the beer more in a glass.&lt;br&gt;
					And it enter the mouth differently from a glass.&lt;br&gt;
					&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ah3dK.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ah3dK.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;On a hot day cheap beer I like it in can.  A nice darker beer I will drink from a (chilled) glass.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Make a &lt;a href="http://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/kir-royale"&gt;kir royale&lt;/a&gt; with it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Add a small amount of a strong, fruity liqueur to the bottom of the glass, such as creme de cassis or framboise (Chambord is one brand name).  Then gently add the sparkling wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Often, cheap sparkling wine is not very palatable because it is bitter: the strong fruit flavors of the liqueur will mask this.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It depends upon what you think a dark beer tastes like because there is a wide range of shades of dark, and a wide range of flavors that come with dark.  The amber beers can have tastes of caramel and dark fruits like raisins.  Stouts, like a Guinness, will have roasty flavors, and those and porters can have hints of chocolate and coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The easiest is probably to add a little dark beer to your light beer, like you have with a &lt;a href="https://www.yuengling.com/black_and_tan"&gt;half and half&lt;/a&gt;.   The downside here is that you open two beers when you only want to drink one, but you could always save the mix-in beer in the fridge.  You could also add come coffee, a tablespoon at a time, and see if you like it.  Or, you could cut it with, not a dark beer, but an amber colored one like an Irish Red, or a Mexican lager like a Negra Modelo, if you don't want too much of a "dark" flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you really want to do it "right" and you live near a home-brew shop, pick up some caramel malt, like a crystal 40 or 60, make a little tea with it in some warm water, and add that to the beer.  That's basically what goes on in the brewing process.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you like the floral taste of earl grey tea, you might enjoy adding a splash of St. Germain elderflower liqueur and a lemon twist to black tea.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The very refreshing Rosa Mae cocktail combines black tea, gin, honey and lime.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm currently sipping a hot toddy made with lemon &amp;amp; ginger herbal tea, honey, and a local whiskey.  It's very soothing on a sore throat.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Smoke and drink like a pirate.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rum&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;cigars&lt;/strong&gt; both hail from the Caribbean, so it’s no coincidence that they work well with one another. Match the spiced and sweet molasses undertones of this full-bodied dark spirit with creamy cigar, like a flavorfully nutty and cocoa-infused &lt;a href="https://www.jrcigars.com/brand/casa-magna" rel="nofollow"&gt;Casa Magna&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, we know there are clear rums as well but, in all honesty, most combinations with this spirit will be subpar. - &lt;a href="http://Best%20Cigar%20Pairings%20with%20Beer%20&amp;amp;%20Alcohol%20Drinks" rel="nofollow"&gt;Best Cigar Pairings with Beer &amp;amp; Alcohol Drinks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For those into &lt;strong&gt;E-Cigarettes&lt;/strong&gt; here is a suggestion:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;A British e-cigarette manufacturer has a new option for those who enjoy a smoke with their favorite alcoholic beverage. London Fox recently rolled out two new e-cigarettes, the Silver and the Refresh, meant to be paired with beers, cocktails or wine. - &lt;a href="http://www.psfk.com/2016/07/e-cigarette-offers-suggested-drink-pairings.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;This E-Cigarette Offers Suggested Drink Pairings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is some pairings for Marijuana, for those interested and where it is legal to smoke: &lt;a href="http://www.foodrepublic.com/2016/02/18/how-to-pair-beer-and-marijuana-a-match-made-in-hazy-heaven/" rel="nofollow"&gt;How To Pair Beer And Marijuana: A Match Made In Hazy Heaven&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are lots of articles and blogs regarding &lt;a href="http://pipesmagazine.com/blog/put-that-in-your-pipe/tobacco-and-beverage-pairings/" rel="nofollow"&gt;tobacco and beverage pairing.&lt;/a&gt; These usually focus on cigars and pipe tobacco. In general, pair tobacco to alcohol in the same way one would pair food and alcohol. Fruity food pairings = fruity tobacco pairings, etc. In theory, mentholated tobacco would go with any minty food/alcohol pairings (no experience with this one.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Due to the mass-production of (and chemical additives in) most cigarettes, they are generally not considered. However, organic and artisan cigarettes can also achieve a nice pairing with some beverages. Personally, I enjoy a full-flavored, organic tobacco Natural American Spirit with a Guinness, when I can.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With Marijuana, these turned up in a quick search...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would avoid alcohol in tea, its so much better in coffee! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I put any bad whisky (grouse etc) in plain old instant coffee with a bit of caster sugar and thats nice. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you want to be more adventurous then make a strong black coffee, preferably espresso and add a shot of Irish whisky, a shot of baileys (or equivalent) add one teaspoons of sugar and a little whipped cream to your taste. The result is well worth the effort! I dont personally drink caffeine so I do all this with decaf and its still amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I just shove any cheap whisky (usually grouse) into espresso coffee and add a little caster sugar - thats good! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Other combinations are espresso coffee with a shot of baileys and a shot of bourbon topped up with whipped cream and a little sugar to your taste. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The type of coffee in my experience (which is plentiful!) dosent really make much of a difference, buy mid range espresso coffee and you can create beautiful things. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I also add liqueur into coffee for people at work (barman - coffee liqueurs arent my thing) but theres plenty of people on youtube who will show you how to make the perfect coffee liqueur. Enjoy the beautiful combination that is coffee and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Generally, you'll want to avoid things with brighter, more acidic fruit flavors (apple, lemon) as those will mess with the inherent acidity of the coffee (although it should be noted that cherry is sometimes used)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Kahlua and Baileys are commonly used, as are more woodsy whiskeys. Avoid anything with carbonation, as the carbonic acid will again mess up the flavor of the coffee (beer is a no-no) and you should also avoid scotches, rye, or other peaty-earthy whiskeys.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, rum is pretty good with coffee, if you're using raw sugar in your coffee - demerara and rum are best friends.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Rumpleminze (peppermint schnapps) and coffee and cream creates a smooth and potent alcoholic drink.  Add a Godiva Chocolate Liquor for a first class-after dinner cocktail.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Grand Marnier(something like an orange flavored brandy) goes well with both black coffee and coffee and cream.  If you like your coffee black Grand Mariner adds flavor and potency without adding a lot of sweetness.  Of course it goes just as well with cream, which results in something a lot like a chocolate orange.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A Tuaca(people often describe it as tasting something like butterscotch) Macchiatto(my own recipe) is an alchololic twist on the classic coffeeshop favorite.   Mix a shot of Tuaca into a shot of steamed milk.  Top with Coffee. This tastes mild but packs a decent punch, and if you take the time to do it properly ("mark it"), it looks pretty cool. (This also tastes great with regular milk or cream.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A second variation on this, which is far less potent is to replace Tuaca with 1/2 a shot of Chambord and 1/2 a shot of Godiva White Chocolate Liqueur and mix thoroughly .  This will an tasty adult white chocolate mocha.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finally, a classic cocktail combination is coffee (with or without cream) and Sambuca.  Sambuca is often served with 3 coffee beans, but it works very well with an entire cup.  Sambuca contributes a lithe sweetness that delicately lingers in the mouth.  Avoid if you don't like Anise or Licorice.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For a seriously potent version of Sambuca and Coffee swap out Sambuca for Absinthe(not refined).  In addition to the alcohol content, Absinthe also offers a jolt akin to what caffeine provides.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Be responsible and Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that smoking diminishes one's ability to taste(I'm not sure about Vaping). I haven't found any literature that explains if just only one cigarette will change your sense of taste, but anecdotally I believe it will have an effect. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/03/140325094810.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;Smokers' bitter taste buds may be on the fritz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This a large reason that smoking and drinking often go together.  Alcohol tastes less potent to smokers.  As an obvious result, more potent liquors like moonshine or absinthe will go do down a little easier for smokers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In my mind, the most classic pairing of smoke and alcohol is cognac or regular brandy and a cigar.  Often people dip their cigars into brandy before drinking.  Generally, this is considered a faux pas and unnecessary given modern humidors. The origin of this tradition was to add moisture to the cigar.  The dipping can take from the nature flavor of the cigar.  However, I recommend it for particularly cheap or unpalatable cigars, or if you don't like them at all but are smoking one anyway.  Be careful though, it can be a little like putting ketchup on Filet Mignon.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless,  The flavor of cognac/ brandy compliments cigar smoking quite nicely.  You can sip them and enhance the flavors of the cigar.  My preference is Grand Mariner(made from cognac and bitter orange), and a cigar, although I am not cigar aficionado so I don't have a specific cigar to recommend.  The Grand Mariner flavor rests on the tongue after drinking and creates a very rich mouth feel, particularly in combination with smoke.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Vaping seems prime for pairing with alcohol.  Given the myriad flavors available, I think match flavors would be good.  Consider the vape juice flavor as an ingredient in your cocktail.  Jack and Coke? Try vanilla vape juice and it will be reminiscent of Vanilla Coke.  Try Cake Vape and Gingerale and Vodka to create the impression of Cream Soda. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Why, a Buck's Fiz, of course! Two parts chilled Champagne (recommend a NV from a non-&lt;em&gt;Grandes Marques&lt;/em&gt; Champagne house) or bubbly (chilled white sparkling wine that isn't from the Champagne region) to one part freshly squeezed orange juice from oranges stored in a fridge. This is a British idea, one that is traditionally served mid-morning or even as a chaser to a good cooked breakfast with top-notch ingredients! A Christmas morning indulgence or as a libation to kick off the day on any other celebratory occasion. What's not to enjoy about that, then?  (Wikipedia)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I like the sweeter liqueurs like Glayva, Grand Marnier and especially Galliano with espresso. If you have a milk-based coffee, combine with a cream-based liqueur. I have never liked alcohol mixed directly in the coffee, it gives conflicting tastes. Coffee and liqueur should be sipped separately to fully enjoy each.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When I didn't like beer, I was introduced to the Shandy. Just lemonade and a wheat beer... she may start out with a lot of lemonade, but over time there will be less lemonade and more beer, as she gets used to the taste. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can use any beer with lemonade and achieve a similar effect. I also like pale ale, or a lager that is light (not a light beer)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, I have a female acquaintance that swears by Hard Root Beer. It's less alcoholic than normal beers though.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I agree that making kyr royale is a good solution.
					Also putting some fresh and perfumed herbs in it will help. Try Lemon Balm or others that you like. Put the wine in a carafe together with some bundles of leaves, leave it in the fridge for 30 min.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A good cigar pairs well with a neat snifter of whiskey or aged bourbon. Tobacco is a naturally occurring plant, and whiskey is a byproduct of naturally occurring plants as well. What you’ll find is that each complements and enhances the flavors of the other. The flavors of the cigar will take on new, invigorated life, and the whiskey will offer you great flavors that would otherwise be too subtle without the discerning presence of the cigar. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The primary effect a spitoon would have, is less alcohol recpetion (some alcohol will get into the blood via the mouth-mucus). The alcohol could lead to different results for the later wines. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You might get a more intense taste of the wine if you could take more of it into your mouth and "wash" with it. Even more if you take a sip, wash, gulp/spit, take another sip and taste.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Maybe you want to try it, when you drink a glass of wine next time and then decide if the bigger sips / double sipping makes a difference to you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If it does but you dislike the idea of a spitoon, try reducing the number of wines per evening, so the increasing intoxication is not a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I really like your version of private tastings and might adopt some ideas from it. Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's fairly common in the wine trade to spit wine when evaluating wine as a buyer, winemaker, sommelier because you will get trashed if you drank everything.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So there are two ways to spit. There is the common spit "bucket" and the paper coffee cup methods. When I taught at our local community college, they had every student spit wine into white paper coffee cups. Some people don't want to touch a common spit bucket and not everyone one is good at spitting with precision, so I recommend the coffee cup approach for beginners. You should see real professionals, they can spit into a bucket from 20 feet!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is a technique to it that takes a little bit of mastery so you don't end up dribbling wine all down your chin and clothes, but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Guinness Draft is an Irish Dry Stout, a session beer, with alcohol by volume at 4.2%. It is intended that you can sit and drink several pints without becoming overly intoxicated. Compare that with Bud Light, which is 4.3%. Guinness has much more flavor than Bud Light, or any other similar American Light Lager beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you compare it with Guinness Extra Stout (5.6% abv) or Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (7.5% abv) or any Russian Imperial Stout like Victory Storm King (9.1%) or Stone RIS (10.6% abv), then, yes, it will taste "watered down" by comparison. But you would be comparing apples with watermelons.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The beer called Guinness draft in Ireland would be called Guinness On Tap in locations such as New York.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The reason for the emphasis on draft versus in bottle is quality and taste. 
					In my experience over recent decades, people pay extra for the most popular bottled beers in the US and in my opinion this is because of the guaranteed quality of bottled. Depending on the bar, the draft (tap) beer can vary from OK to well, stale, or watery, or even unhealthy in some disreputable cases. 
					The bottle is much more tamper-proof.  So for this reason people will pay a couple of dollars more per drink for the same volume, of the same brand.&lt;br&gt;
					Having said that, your large volume commercial US (and European) beers are mostly lagers, pilsners and the like.  For these kinds of beer, the difference between bottled and high quality draft in a good bar, is small.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But Guinness stout is a very specific kind of brew.  As a variant of porter, it provides a very different experience from the bottle versus on draft.
					It is very rare to see anyone in Ireland drink bottled Guinness (or any other brand of stout) in their local pub. Compared to draft, the bottled tastes bitter, is gassy and does not keep the creamy head to anything like the same extent as well served draft. In contrast, a good pint of draft stout is creamy, the maltiness well balanced with hops.  Try a taste comparison and you will see for yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But have it in a reputable pub in Ireland.  There the supply chain is quality assured and the bartender is well drilled in the pour, which is also unique to draft stout.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The best advice is to adjust the quantity of the spirit to the percentage of alcohol it contains.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Assuming you drink responsibly, i can assure you that even a 91% spirit can be tasted and enjoyed like a pint of beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;EDIT: As always, i think i can let the personal experience talks, i tried one of the most powerful alcoholemic recipe i can in Italy, &lt;a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/it/Gocce_Imperiali" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Gocce imperiali&lt;/a&gt; and i can assure that if the sip is like 4/5 drops, is enjoyable&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your question is a bit broad because the flavour of high ABV spirits, and the intention of the spirits themselves vary widely.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some alcohols with a high ABV, such as Hungarian Palinka, are sometimes drunk purely for inebriation. They have a high alcohol content mainly to cause the intended effects, not to produce a pleasing drink. These types of spirits are also often flavourless and used to make cocktails with alcohol content.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I've had Scotches that were as high as 60% but very easily drunk neat, and quite pleasing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So in sum: whether and how someone enjoys a high ABV spirit really depends on the spirit and it's individual qualities.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Oh... something I am a real expert at! You are mixing your context when calling vines hybrids. There are three ways you can grow grapes for fruit. 100% original "own rooted" vines, grafted vines and hybridized vines. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Let's back up so I can explain why that is. Many Americans in the 1600-1800s tried unsuccessfully to bring European vines to North America and they always died within a few years and they could never figure out. When American vines were brought to France in the 1860s to study the differences between American and European vines, they inadvertently brought a root louse called phylloxera with them in the soil (they also brought over powdery mildew, but that's another story). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As it came to be, phylloxera completely wiped out most vineyards in Europe within a decade or so. Then started a race to figure out a "cure" for this bug. Three methods were attempted. The first was to drown the soil in chemicals to kill the bugs and that worked for a long time. Some vineyards were still operating like that until the 1960s. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;After more research, they figured out that American vines were resistant to phylloxera. So that led to the other two ways of keeping their vines alive. Hybridization between French and American vines. These hybrids were resistant and yet made drinkable wine. Not the same quality as 100% vitis vinifera but hey it got you tipsy just like a good Cabernet did. Many of these hybrids are still around. I have grown several of them. One that I liked a lot is called Leon Millot. The French after WWII, in a fit of purity, have banned most of these grapes and had them ripped out.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The third way was considered the best way to preserve the flavors of the cabernets and chardonnays of the world. They took a page from the apple growing industry, which had already perfected the art of grafting roots onto a different tree. So, they grafted American vines onto French (and German and Italian and so on) vines. This worked out almost perfectly for everyone. In fact, because they use several different vitis species (there is only one vitis species in Europe, vitis vinifera) they were able to more tightly control how the vines grow. This saved the wine industry around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are only several small pockets and one large one, where phylloxera hasn't invaded. The big one is Washington State in the Northwest corner of the United States. This is where I live. Because of the unique soils (very sandy) and climate (basically a desert) they can grow "own rooted" vines. So, if you are in a place where you can buy a Washington State wine, you are tasting the last place on earth where European vines are grown on their own roots.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Can you taste a difference? I would say not really. There are so many factors that come into play when making a wine. Any subtle influences the own rooted vs. rootstock play in flavor is masked by things like oak, climate, yeast and so on. Just be happy there is a place in the world that phylloxera has not invaded! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A very interesting one is &lt;a href="https://www.ciroc.com/vodkas/peach" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Ciroc Peach&lt;/a&gt; with 7-Up/Sprite. Tastes like fuzzy peach juice. You can mix 7-Up/Sprite with any of the other flavors of Cioc(or any flavored vodka if we generalize) but I find Peach the best for my personal tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you want something sweet you can try &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;amaretto and coke (&lt;a href="http://cocktails.lovetoknow.com/amaretto-coke" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;some more detailed information)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					for an even sweeter experience you can even go for a mix with Dr pepper &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It has a slimier taste to a bakewell tart so it is recommended if you like sweet things &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My favorite Hi Ball of all Time is Vernor's(an obscure, potent ginger all type soda) and whiskey.  Two powerful flavors that manage to keep their potency while still blending very well. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a general rule for all of these Using a 12oz glass, I would pour 1.5 oz of liquor with 4.5oz soda directly over ice- stir gently.  Drink with a full sized straw.  Garnish with lime, orange, cherry, or lemon as appropriate.&lt;/em&gt; (The straw may seem unimportant, but in fact it creates a different experience than a sip straw or no straw)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're into sweet things I recommend Tuaca and Cream Soda (Jones' is my favorite for this).  Tuaca is 80 proof and is sort of a Vanilla and Orange Liquor with butterscotch after notes.  It's sweetness blends well into soda(also Vernor's as above, coke, orange soda, etc..) and very efficiently hides the alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some traditional Hi-Balls:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Vodka with Soda Water and Lime: Descriptive words: Strong, simple, skinny, diet, crisp&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Spiced Rum and Coke- Quite different from a cuba libre.  Descriptive words: Sweet, easy, deceptive, spiced, flavorful&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Vodka and Tonic and Lime: Descriptive words: Strong, simple, skinny, diet, potent, blunt, Quinine&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Jack Daniels and Ginger: Descriptive words: Sweet, Bright, Easy, Traditional&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Scotch and Soda (The original Hi-Ball): Descriptive words: Traditional, potent, slow-sipping&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some non-traditional quick combos:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Cake Vodka and Coke: Descriptive words: Soda Shop, Sweet, Vanilla Coke, Rich&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Whipped Cream Vodka and Orange Soda: Descriptive words: dessert, old-fashioned, soda shop, masked alcohol, deceptively strong&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Pear or Apple Vodka and Sparkling Apple Juice:  Descriptive words: Apple Pie, Crisp, Sweet, Refreshing&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skinny Bitch&lt;/strong&gt; - Vodka and Diet Coke: Descriptive words: Diet, skinny, easy&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dirty Shirley&lt;/strong&gt; - Vodka (or cherry vodka) Ginger Ale (or Sprite) and grenadine(3/4 oz):  Descriptive words: Sweet, fun, masked alcohol, deceptively strong, bubbly&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double O-7&lt;/strong&gt; - Orange Vodka/ lemon vodka orange slice or splash of OJ mixed with 7/up sprite :  Descriptive words: Crisp, lively, effervescent, citrus, refreshing, bubbly&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swamp Juice&lt;/strong&gt; (Named for color of beverage) - Mountain Dew and Captain Spiced Rum: Descriptive words: Energizing, sharp, citrus&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Try &lt;strong&gt;Red Wine and Coke&lt;/strong&gt;. And do not forget the ice... It is great one hot days.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Turns out this is quite a hit in most of Europe already. Who would have thought that red wine and coke would go this well together? It is coke with a grape twist and its taste killer. - &lt;a href="http://ca.askmen.com/recess/recommended/best-soda-and-alcohol-combinations-4.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Red Wine and Coke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Gin is very simply defined as&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;a clear alcoholic spirit distilled from grain or malt and flavoured with juniper berries.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So your differentiation between "made properly" and "just alcohol and flavor" is meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Many of the finest gins are made by steeping juniper berries and other botanicals in the distilled spirit. Others are created by passing the newly formed vapour through a "botanicals basket" prior to condensation. Whichever way they are created, they are still gin.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So all the ones in your picture are "proper" gins. Many of them are really nice (that Caorunn is good.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Myself - I'm a big fan of the Gilt Single Malt Gin, as well as my own gin - the Metaltech (which is only for sale at our gigs.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what you mean by properly, but it seems like you mean "that you would like".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You could try reading &lt;a href="http://theginisin.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://theginisin.com/&lt;/a&gt; and getting a feel for if you agree with the reviewer based on what you currently like, then use his reviews as a jumping off point either positively or negatively.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;I believe that the only truly valid way it to try them.&lt;/strong&gt;  That said if your mixing the gin with tonic(and perhaps a lime), there is probably very little chance you can taste the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Many people think they are alcohol connoisseurs, but in truth very few are -it take real practice and training.  This idea has fascinated me for a long time and working over a decade behind a bar has given me insight.  &lt;strong&gt;It rings true for every kind of alcohol, varietal of wine, and type of beer.  Most people can not tell the difference.&lt;/strong&gt;  What I have here is anecdotal, but perhaps it can help to inform you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I worked at a square bar with a partition in the middle(you could not see across the bar completely).  On occasion we would run out of something, bud light, Kendall Jackson, Patron, Crown, Tanqueray, Grey Goose etc.  If it wasn't too busy, On the order side of the bar, I would make the person something similar: miller light instead of bud, Cuervo Silver instead of patron, R&lt;strong&gt;ail gin instead of Tanqueray&lt;/strong&gt;, smirnoff instead of Grey Goose.  I would let them try it for a bit and then have another bartender ask what they were drinking under some pretense.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Never once did anyone notice or at least speak up, and this happened easily more than 100 times.  Afterwards I would tell them my "mistake" and offer to not charge them for the drink or buy them a round of the correct brand.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Less often, but still on occasion(dozens of times) I would hear someone talking about how only brand X will do and everything else is trash.  I would tell them that I don't think they can tell the difference and that I was willing to make a bet.  Their humiliation against a free drink.  I would fill 3 small glasses with enough liquor for a taste.  I would then put the bottle for their brand and two other bottles of a similar liquor in front of them.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The bet? They have to tell me what liquor is in each glass.  If they can, then they get a free shot(or sometimes more than one), if they can't they have to admit they can't tell the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would fill all three glasses with their favorite brand(never said I would use all three bottles).  &lt;strong&gt;If there was a mixer involved, not a single person figured it out,&lt;/strong&gt; even though a very large portion of players were certain they were right.  If the liquor was straight up, then about 10% - 15% could figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying there are no taste differences between gins- there are. For the uninitiated though, they are difficult to detect straight. When you mix it with tonic(or another mixer) many of the differences are completely lost and only practiced connoisseurs will be able to detect what they are specifically drinking.  Based on your question, it does not appear you fall into this category(most of us don't).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Mostly what you are getting with a certain brand is a feeling from ordering it, not a distinct flavor profile.  In that light, let go of the importance of taste and try to consider feeling. Ask yourself, what feeling are you trying to get for yourself?  You want the bartender to think well of you?  You want to feel like you are drinking something made with high quality methods? You want to feel superior to others? You want to recapture a memory?  You want to seem cool? You want to impress someone?  You want to feel like you are getting your money's worth?  Want to spend as little/ as much as possible?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Let the feeling you are chasing help you choose the right brand.  Alternatively, you could go about tasting all of these gins in order to gain the actual skill to know the difference.  However, this will take years and doesn't have much use in regular bar drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These stereotypes may very by locale, but just as a starting point:&lt;/strong&gt;
					Want to seem urban tough, try Tanqueray.
					Want to seem urban sophisticated, try Tanqueray 10
					Want to seem like you know a good classic, try Saffire.
					Want to show working class grit, try beef eaters or gordon's or rail.
					Want to seem informed or hip (depending on whats available), try Caorunn, Hendrix, or anything local or "small batch".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I expect I may get some kickback from some folks about difficulty of tasting the difference and I say to you prove me wrong.  Perform a blind taste test- mark the bottom of the glass with a label facing down and make sure to put multiples of the each brand in order to make sure you actually able to tell the difference and not just guessing correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiebell/2012/07/09/is-there-really-a-taste-difference-between-cheap-and-expensive-wines/#47d200783ae2" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Also, here is a link to relevant article(for wine not gin) that concludes that people can not tell the difference in brands.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beers (ales and lagers) are broken down into many, many different styles based on how they are brewed. Most beers have only 3 or 4 different types of ingredients. Malt, water, yeast, hops and sometimes fruit or herbs. While there doesn't seem like there can be a lot of variation, there are almost an infinite amount of ways to combine these ingredients. For the specific beers you mention, Brown Ale and Mild Ale are very similar styles. I'm not sure what you mean by "The Ale". &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.craftbeer.com/beer/beer-styles-guide#english-style-dark-mild" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Mild Ale&lt;/a&gt; vs. &lt;a href="https://www.craftbeer.com/beer/beer-styles-guide#english-style-brown-ale" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Brown Ale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;English-Style Brown Ale
					Style Family: Brown Ales&lt;/strong&gt;
					The English-style brown ale ranges from dryer (Northern English) to sweeter (Southern English) maltiness. Roast malt tones (chocolate, nutty) may sometimes contribute to the flavor and aroma profile. Hop bitterness is very low to low, with very little hop flavor and aroma. Known for rich and advanced malt aroma and flavor without centering too much on hops, the English-style mild is extremely sessionable and food-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;English-Style Mild Style Family: Brown Ales&lt;/strong&gt;
					Malt and caramel are part of the flavor and aroma profile of the English-style mild while licorice and roast malt tones may sometimes contribute as well. Hop bitterness is very low to low. U.S. brewers are known to make lighter-colored versions as well as the more common “dark mild.” These beers are very low in alcohol, yet often are still medium-bodied due to increased dextrin malts.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you want to dig deeper into this read the &lt;a href="https://www.craftbeer.com/beer/beer-styles-guide" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Beer Style Study Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's been proven scientifically! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is an &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/does-sound-affect-the-way-we-taste/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; that breaks it down&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, some research suggests that, under the right conditions, loud noise might actually enhance certain flavors&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Are these people on vacation? It's a well known fact that things taste better on vacation. &lt;a href="https://www.travelbelles.com/2012/11/wine-doesnt-taste-same-at-home/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Why wine tastes better on vacation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Reason 1: The answer you’ve probably heard or read before: you’re in Europe! You’re relaxed. Everything is going to taste better.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Actually you could scratch "Europe" and put anywhere you are on vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Limit: So, I would speculate that if you're "vaping" the same quantity of alcohol as you might instead drink, then you're facing the same risk. It's the same as drinking alcohol - the risk is cumulative and hard to define - it really &lt;a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/alcohol-related-brain-impairment" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;depends&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;how much&lt;/strong&gt; you drink and &lt;strong&gt;how often&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Effect on lungs: Frankly this is hard to say, as I am quite confident there have been no large scale (AKA reputable) studies (nor can I find any) performed on the effect of vaping alcohol on lung tissues. I would &lt;em&gt;expect&lt;/em&gt; the effects to be minimal, but then again, personally, I'd probably still just stick to drinking my alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I can't provide any scientific basis to this, but I am thoroughly confident that vaping is simply a fad or novelty to enjoy - think of the increased costs and lack of accessibility compared to just drinking alcohol - you simply need a bottle of beer and a fridge, or a bottle of spirits and a glass versus a specialised glass, tea candle, vapour catching vessel and a &lt;strong&gt;glass or metal straw&lt;/strong&gt; (seriously, who keeps one of them around?).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I home brew ales and stouts all the time and have never carbonated or even bottled it. I have never missed the bubbles or the constant burping. In fact, I am enjoying a glass of English Bitter right now. Tasty and refreshing. Five gallons of beer so that I can dip a jug whenever I want, and no messing with bottles. By the time you finish the 2nd one, you will not miss the carbonation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You want a mildly flavored, low hop beer for something like this. I would suggest a Kolsch or Helles Lager or a Mild. Pilsners can be heavily hopped. I have done a lot of this with wines when I taught winemaking classes at a community college near here. We used very low aroma wines like a warm climate sauvignon blanc. You want the same for this since you don't want anything to get in the way of your samples. Also keep a small cup of coffee beans and water nearby to "reset" your nose and mouth between smelling and tasting. I wouldn't do two different beers it will muddy things. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You should definitely all use the same beer as the base, and you want a beer that has a good balance of hops and malt. The less flavor the beer has, the more the "spiked" flavors and aromas will stand out. Too much aromatic hops (e.g., an IPA) will mask the aromas. Too much malt will mask the flavors. A lighter, neutral beer is the way to go for an educational tasting.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I agree with everything farmersteve said except for the part about the coffee beans. That's an extremely strong flavor and aroma that will taint the beer tasting. As one who dislikes coffee, I can say that smelling coffee beans would ruin whatever beer sample I next tasted.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would choose Coors. It's easy to get, always tastes the same so it makes for a good control. Also, it is light in flavor so it won't mask anything. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Tea and beer can be a great combination. I have a blog post &lt;a href="https://teawithgary.com/2014/11/25/tea-and-beer/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; about some tea beers that I made in cooperation with a local brewery. The combination of cinnamon orange spice tea with a hefeweizen worked especially well, as hefes are often served with a slice of citrus.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I took a class a few years back on pairing tea with whiskey (or whisky). They were focused on serving the whiskey and tea separately rather than blending them, but blending can work nicely. I'm a fan of smokey malty Scotch — mostly the Islays — and it blends nicely with a powerful black tea. If you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; dig the smoke flavor, blend an Islay Scotch with a lapsang souchong or Russian Caravan tea.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you like citrus flavors in your tea, try using a splash of Triple Sec or Cointreau.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In Northern Germany they handle it in the following way. First they take rock candy and put it into a glass. It can be brown or white rock candy. The glass is filled up with brown rum which has a Vol% between 38 and 40 of alcohol. It is possible to mix and use it immediately, but most people just put it aside for a while. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;After some time the fluid of rum becomes glutinous and the surface of the rock candy becomes soft. When this mixture is in that status they put some spoons of it into the cup and fill it up with black tea. Could be from Ceylon or comparable. When filling up with the hot tea the rock candy crashes internally and when mixing up the tea with it all it becomes a wonderful experience especially in wintertime.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I spent many years in Germany  and other European countries drinking many different types of beer...I can tell you, for me, a Pilsner is best served in tall thin glasses, export beer in mugs, preferentially stein type and wheat beers in flute style glasses....taste, aroma and the expereince is all different with these glasses...oh and for general knowledge, fruits and other flavors only ruin beer....&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Refrigeration has little to do with preservation.  As a food product beer and NA beer are pretty strictly regulated for safety so as long as the rubber in the cap maintains a seal it should stay sterile.  Refrigeration is mostly for taste and carbonation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Why do some wines taste salty?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ed C. Kraus, a 3rd generation home brewer/winemaker and has been an owner of E. C. Kraus since 1999 has 4 possible reasons why a wine may have a salty taste. He has been helping individuals make better wine and beer for over 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;My first thought would be that if you are aging in a wooden barrel, the remnant salts from the sodium metabisulfite may have built up over the years through insufficient rinsing or no rinsing at all. But this is very unlikely. If you make any kind of conscious effort to rinse a barrel you would be able to keep up with the trace amount of salts that are left behind with each wine batch. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;My second thought is that a mistake was made in a dosage added to a wine/must. For instance, yeast nutrient (diammonium phosphate) would add what some would call a salty taste to the wine if too much were added, but this would take many times the normal recommend dosage.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Third would be saltiness from the grapes themselves. This could add a salty taste in wine. This could apply if you made the wine from fresh grapes from a vineyard. The mineral content of the soil is always reflected in the grape’s flavor to some degree. This is one of the reasons a grape’s origin is always noted. If you are making wine for the first time from a particular soil or terroir, then this is what could be going on.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The fourth thing that comes to mind is a mold infection. The only reason I left this for last is because it is the least likely of the four. This is because by the time the wine has a salty taste from mold, it is already blatantly obvious from a visual inspection that mold as set in. So if you don’t see any patches of dried crust on the surface anywhere, or a rainbow-ed, oil-slick look on the wine’s surface, the salty taste in the wine is not being caused by a mold.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Beyond these things the only thing that comes to mind is accidentally putting salt in the wine. &lt;/p&gt;
