					&lt;p&gt;It depends on the beer really.  A good rule of thumb is darker beer should be served at a warmer temperature than lighter beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For instance if you refrigerate all of your beers and then pull them out of the fridge and drink them instantly you will miss A LOT of the flavor complexity of pretty much every stout and porter you put to your lips.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But, if you let the dark stuff warm up for just 15 minutes before you drink it (let it sit at room temp) a bunch of new flavors will appear that you never would have noticed otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This doesn't work so well, in my experience, for lighter beers like pilsner, lager, or hefe-weisen.  They really are meant to be drank cold and letting them get warm changes their flavor profile for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Obviously there will always be personal preferences but, at a minimum I encourage you to try letting your darker beers warm up just a bit and see what a positive difference it makes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is a temperature guide from this article: &lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/Story.asp?StoryID=479" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Serving Temperature Guide&lt;/a&gt;. It categorizes different beers based on temps to serve at.  These are basic rules of thumb and again you'll want to experiment and discover what temps you like your beers at the best.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a few components to the interaction between flavor and temperature, but one key one is simply that &lt;strong&gt;cold numbs your tongue&lt;/strong&gt;.  At least, extreme cold (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; "cold as the rockies").&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As such, overly cold beer will dull &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; strong flavor (hoppiness, bitterness, etc) and hide weaker ones.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href="http://blog.khymos.org/2007/06/03/new-perspectives-on-whisky-and-water/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; which also cites &lt;a href="http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/%28SICI%291097-0010%2819990515%2979:7%3C1015%3a%3aAID-JSFA321%3E3.0.CO;2-R"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; discussing the chemical effects of cooling and dilution on whiskey.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The post concluded that the mix of dilution and cooling causes the alcohol to become soluble, which releases the flavour.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Ethanol becomes more soluble when whiskey is diluted and cooled, this promotes release of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;flavour molecules&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think this theory is applicable to beer, but with a few caveats; firstly, beer is already diluted and doesn't need any more water added; secondly, the alcohol content of beer is much lower than that of whiskey, so not as much cooling would be required.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer should be chilled to the proper serving temperature, which may vary according to ingredients and brewing methods, and even most of those are not set in stone, but can also vary according to taste.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Guinness, for example, has a specific serving temperature related to how it was traditionally stored in Ireland (Kegs in the "cold" room, which was often just a room carved out of the hill behind the pub or similar).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far a why grocery and convenience stores keep it chilled, it's basically appealing to the "grab and go" drinker, who intends on consuming it in the very near future, or with a short transport. Often they are slightly higher price than if you were to go to a liquor store.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Liquor stores have much larger selection and inventory, and refrigerating everything would be cost prohibitive. The price is generally slightly less than the grab and go locations, although many liqour stores still keep some of the more popular and mainstream beers in the cooler as well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For most commercially available beers, you can cool, warm and recool several times with minimal to no changes to taste. Some craft and/or home brews may be affected more by this process, but I don't know if there is any kind of a list available.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To quote &lt;a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail39.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Strongbad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;"A one that is not cold, is scarcely a one at all."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In supermarkets you will often see the same beers stored in refrigerated and non-refrigerated sections.  Or you may be able to get a beer cold somewhere but only warm somewhere else.  If you go to a large beer store you will see beer of every variety sitting in aisles.  The general reason for keeping beer on ice in a store is so it can be drunk right away.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The one exception I can think of is bottle-conditioned beer.  Beer where some degree of fermentation occurs in the bottle, giving it both natural carbonation and causing the flavor to develop over time.  The flavors the beer will take on during conditioning vary based on warm or cold conditioning, and the beer will have a more limited shelf life.  You will typically only see bottle conditioned beer as a product of home brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When talking about the temperature to store/serve beer it is important to note that there is a difference between types of beer (and what we call beer in the UK and what people call beer in  other countries!).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Cask Marque &lt;a href="http://www.cask-marque.co.uk/beer-information/beer-temperature" rel="nofollow"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; has a simple page denoting the various temperatures that some types of beer/ale should be stored at. It is important to note that some beers also need to be stored upright to ensure any live sediment stays at the bottom of the bottle. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, there are currently beers that are served warm, particularly very dark ones.  So part of it has to do with the character of beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are two important factors I see, looking at this as a history nut but not knowing of any sources on this topic.  The first, as you say, is widespread refrigeration.  But this was not the major factor in cold beverages generally since ice was often preserved into the summer for cooling beverages (and has been since ancient times).  But refrigeration makes this easier and thus cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The second is actually the modern bottlecap which is a product of industrialization.  Before the bottlecap most beers were served uncarbonated.  They might be chilled or not, but they would have been entirely uncarbonated, shipped in wooden barrels, etc. and had an altogether different flavor and character than our modern beers.  My experience playing with these concepts as a homebrewer suggests that such beers were better suited to being served warm than comparably dark carbonated beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To understand why, I think you have to look at carbonation and how temperature affects that.  Carbon dioxide is more soluble in cold water than warm water, so the warmer the beer is, the faster it goes flat, and the more it fizzes when opened.  So you have two ways carbonation affects the picture.  First it impacts the taste and serving conditions differently at different temperatures, and secondly it imparts a distinctive off-tang when the beer goes flat.  Temperature helps offset the latter to a mild extent but at the expense of the former.  I think this also helps explain why richer beers are more often served warm than lighter beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would say that the condensate amounts to no more than 1ml for a 500ml glass, which is a 0.2% dilution. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;No to be too coarse, but I imagine most people dilute the beer more after taking a sip! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Comparatively, I think the excessively cold temperature will contribute more to destroying the flavor than a small amount of condensate from the glass. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, if you enjoy the beer in a frozen glass, then keep at it. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One method I know is to have large, heavy steins kept in the freezer. That way as soon as you bring beer, you can cool it by pouring into the stein. It won't cool your lukewarm beer to optimal temperature but it will give it a good few degrees drop.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can use "reusable ice cubes", which are essentially tiny plastic bags with water - that way you won't dilute your beer. There's also a stainless steel variety, it has slightly worse heat capacity but sinks to the bottom, which is less annoying than plastic bags floating in your stein.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I read somewhere about making ice cubes &lt;em&gt;from beer&lt;/em&gt; somewhere, so that they don't dilute your beer (you need a good freezer for that though). I can't vouch if they don't affect the taste though.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A smart method though, is to use the buffer beer. Remove the "buffer beer" from the fridge, put the the lukewarm beer in the fridge, drink the buffer beer - meanwhile the beer you put in the fridge becomes your new buffer beer ;)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;edit: if you go with reusable ice cubes, use ones that contain water inside. Don't buy in to the scam of granite ice cubes or solid steel ice cubes. Their thermal capacity is abysmal. To provide the amount of temperature drop a single normal ice cube provides, you'd need to fill your glass with granite cubes to nearly the brim.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another option might be some what less conservative, but instead of using ice cubes you could also use &lt;a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/734246795/whiskey-rox-beverage-chilling-stones" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;chilling rocks&lt;/a&gt;. This is also often used as an alternative for cooling whisky without diluting it. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F9jTJ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Soapstone is a non-porous, odorless and inert stone. It is tasteless and will not absorb odors from your freezer like ice cubes do. Soapstone has a high thermal mass, giving it the natural ability to retain its temperature for extended periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are a bit more patient, you can just put the beer in the freezer for about 10 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;At the Defcon security conference in Las Vegas, the &lt;a href="http://deviating.net/bccc/"&gt;Beverage Cooling Contraption Contest&lt;/a&gt; is an exciting outdoor event.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Over the years, techniques have included adiabatic cooling (using a jet engine), dry ice, liquid nitrogen etc.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In 2008, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DS70HOdYbebc"&gt;this team managed&lt;/a&gt; to cool a keg of beer from 80F to 33F in 35 seconds using air power, dry ice and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Take a bucket. Or a bowl. Or a cooler.  Or any other similar vessel. Put your beer bottles or cans (sealed! For the love of god, sealed!) at the bottom of the bucket.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Fill it most of the way with ice. Then fill in with water until the bottles are submerged. Then throw in any remaining ice.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finally, add a volume of salt commensurate with the quantity of water, both solid and liquid, you've already got in there.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wait anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes depending on desired coldness and quantity of beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;(Rinse the rim of the bottle if you're finicky. Also, this will probably ruin the label. Sorry. Why do you care about that anyway? You weirdo.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It takes a lot of time to cool a beer bottle in fridge. But it takes much less time if you put them in freezer. However, you shouldn't forget about such bottle, if you don't want the beer to freeze and explode the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If it's not fast enough, take a few glasses, pour a bit beer into each and put them all into fridge. They will cool down much faster than the whole bottle, but the risk of making mess with broken glass is bigger, so it's better to check them each few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One method I've used seen to good effect is to wrap the bottle in wet paper towels, and then put that in the freezer. Once the paper is frozen, the beer is quite cool, also the paper can be removed just by twisting it and it comes right off.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In France we're told that you should always rince the glass with a bit of cold water before serving to remove any trace of dust which will make the foam smoother.&lt;br&gt;
					Since you're not supposed to dry it afterward, I guess that would dilute the beer more than the fozen condensation and it's still not enough water to have any impact on the flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There may be a general consensus for the "proper" serving temperature, which could involve questions like "what do &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; people seem to like?", and "what temperature does the brewer feel best accentuates the parts of the beer they want to highlight?".  So there are good reasons for beer to be served at particular temperatures.  In the case of your British bitters, age-old recipes were probably designed to allow the beer to taste its best at room temperature.  As for a modern British beer, I suppose that would depend on what the brewer had in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, my general thought is that you should drink a beer at the temperature you most like it, so the &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; part of your question is self-determined, and don't let anyone tell you that your taste buds are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Myself, I tend to like my American IPAs cooler than the typical recommended serving temperature.  And before I visited the UK, I couldn't stand a room temperature beer.  Then, after a week in Tunbridge Wells, I picked up a large appreciation for hand-pumped UK beer, served at room temp.  So you should open yourself to trying new things as well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Serving temperature is, of course, a preference.  Serve it frozen or boiling if you want.  However, a few opinions are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.camra.org.uk/beerinthepub" rel="nofollow"&gt;CAMRA says&lt;/a&gt; that Real Ale (aka cask ale, usually english-style) should be served at 12-14 °C (54-57 °F), which is colder than room temperature, but warmer than your usually keg beer.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/Story.asp?StoryID=479" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ratebeer says&lt;/a&gt; the same thing regardless of whether it’s cask or not.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/style/98/" rel="nofollow"&gt;BeerAdvocate says&lt;/a&gt; 7-10 °C (45-50 °F) for an english bitter.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, if you’re looking for a rule of thumb: “cool but not super-cold” or “cellar temp” will probably get you close enough.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, let's say there is what is considered "proper", and then there is personal-preference. To be a good Cicerone, know what is "proper" but also show tolerance for personal preference.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With that out the way, it's definitely considered the "proper" thing to do to serve English beers warmer than ice-cold. Many of the delicate malty flavours you get from English malt, the fruitiness from esters produced by the English yeast, plus grassy, herbal or floral tones from the hops are muted greatly when the beer is served too cold. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some people say it's served at room room temperature. Modern room temperature of around 20&amp;deg;C/68&amp;deg;F is too warm. The ideal serving temperature is a cold cellar - typically around 12&amp;deg;C;55&amp;deg;F. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Just like everyone else said, it's a preference. I alway say that the darker the beer, the warmer it has to be, so here are my rules:&lt;br&gt;
					- &lt;strong&gt;Light beer/White beer/Kriek&lt;/strong&gt;: In the fridge and goes in the freezer for a couple of minutes before serving&lt;br&gt;
					- &lt;strong&gt;Golden beer&lt;/strong&gt;: In the fridge&lt;br&gt;
					- &lt;strong&gt;Amber beer&lt;/strong&gt;: In the fridge and stay at room temperature for a couple of minutes before serving&lt;br&gt;
					- &lt;strong&gt;Dark beer&lt;/strong&gt;: At room temperature and goes in the fridge before serving&lt;br&gt;
					- &lt;strong&gt;Stout&lt;/strong&gt;: At room temperature at all time.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, to clear up the myth.   European beer is not served warm.  Some beers, such as real ale (or cask ale) are served at cellar temperature, which while certainly above the temperature of a beer fresh out a refrigerator, at 12-14 degrees celsius (53-57F) is still much colder than room temperature.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To answer your question:&lt;/strong&gt;  Mulled beer &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; heated beer.  As with wine, mulled beer is usually warmed over a low stove or in a crockpot with spices, often including cinnamon, nutmeg, citrus zest, and a sweetener like brown sugar, but it doesn't &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to include any additional ingredients, particularly if it already has strong spice or fruit characteristics.  So, any beer style that you heat is, in fact, mulled beer.     &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As to styles of beer that would be suitable for mulling, Belgian Strong Dark ales would be good candidates, as would nice fruity lambics.   Barleywine ales, milk stouts, chocolate stouts, and oatmeal stouts I would imagine might also be nice.  The characteristics I'd look for would be a heavy body, more malty than hoppy, a bit of sweetness, and if present, dark fruit (plumbs, figs, raisins) or berries.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;TL DR; No.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer flavor changes over time (hops fade away, oxidation takes hold, etc.), and this process happens more quickly at warmer temperatures than colder ones. But there are no additional chemical reactions caused by temperature changes, so warming to room temperature and re-chilling multiple times is not going to have any added effects on the beer. Assuming you are drinking it within a few weeks, you won't notice the difference with bottled or canned beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think this myth took hold from left-over kegs after parties: A half-empty keg that was dispensed by pumping air into it will start to oxidize much more quickly since oxygen is being added to it. When it warms the oxidation speeds up and it tastes stale within a day or two. Keeping it cold slows that down a bit, but even cold it won't last very long. A keg being dispensed using CO2 is a different story: that will last as long as bottled beer and can be warmed and rechilled without ill effects.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In all of this, I am referring to room temperature. Beer left in a car in the sun for hours will start to stale much more quickly, even if bottles are protected from the sunlight. You won't get the skunky flavor caused by the light, but it will taste stale.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I did some experimentation at home to answer this question.  My results indicated that room temperature and temperature fluctuation had no impact on flavour.  Very high temperature (140° for 24 hours) seems to create a very slight hard to define harshness.  Check out my results here:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally as a rule of thumb I would allow my choice to be dictated by the level of carbonation in the beer. Temperature affects how rapidly carbon dioxide dissipates from the beer, so the more carbon dioxide it starts with, the colder I would serve it, in order to preserve it in its intended state for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My personal taste would also entail a slightly cooler temperature for pale ale styles (lighter in colour and body and hoppier) and slightly warmer for brown ales, bitters, stouts and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would also like to register my objection to the term 'warm' used for beer. I don't know of any drinking culture that really does encourage the &lt;em&gt;warm&lt;/em&gt; serving of beer in any normal understanding of the word. 'Warm' really refers to cellar temperature rather than refrigerator or just-above-zero temperature. A similar temperature to that you'd expect in red wine would be appropriate for the 'warm' beers. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As stated earlier, temperature is a matter of taste regarding beer. Necessity may also play a part (Given a choice between a warm beer vs no beer it depends how thirsty you are!).&lt;br&gt;
					German-style lagers are almost exclusively recommended to be served no lower than 6°C (43°F)no higher than 9°C (49°F), but I often find that the last (and warmest) mouthfuls from a glass actually have the most flavour - but I would always start with the lager cold when possible.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Real ales are a different story. On the continent of Europe there still seems to be a myth that British drink their beer 'luke-warm', but if served at that temperature most Brits would complain (and maybe continue to drink it while complaining). I believe the phrase 'serve cool' rather than 'cold' applies. Some live, bottled beers actually suffer from being too cold. On of my favourites, Black Sheep Ale develops a 'chill haze' - going a little cloudy if left in the fridge too long. 13°C (55°F)is about right for such beers.
					Reference the book Beer For Dummies!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Similar to the new question, 'what temperature should I serve my beer', which I've just commented on - serving warm beer is largely a myth! The continental Europeans think British beer is served 'luke-warm'. No. Cool, not ice-cold is the preference, at a cellar temp around 13C (room temp being 20-22C). Not sure where the OP is from, but they appear to believe that all Europeans drink warm to hot beer&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I really thought the myth of warm or luke-warm beer had dissipated - obviously not. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Heat and light are the enemies of beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you have a "bottle conditioned" beer -- that is, one in which live yeast are still present -- then under warmer conditions, you potentially have active yeast. To some extent, this may just increase the carbonation and alcohol content. However, if most of the fermentable sugars have already been fermented (that is, converted to CO2 and alcohol), the yeast will start "eating" each other, which will result in some very "off" flavors (though nothing toxic). Under cooler conditions, the yeast will be only minimally active.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether your beer is "bottle conditioned" or not, the hop acids present from the brewing process don't respond favorably to heat or light. In particular, light can cause them to turn "skunky", which is why Corona -- with their clear glass bottles -- often tastes "skunky". Don't trust a beer in a clear bottle ... seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Keep it cool; keep it dark; keep it upright (unlike wine).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Every beer has a shelf life. Beer will certainly "last" longer if refrigerated. That is, the flavor will evolve more slowly over time at lower temperatures. Storage at higher than room temperature will invite a turning of the beer's flavor for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In some cases, an aged beer might be considered to have an appealing taste, but still refrigeration will slow the aging process and allow the beer to be kept longer. Additionally, the flavor of highly hopped beers will degrade fairly quickly (within several months) at room temperature, and most people would agree that very hoppy beers in particular &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be refrigerated because of this.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I believe the general principal is that lower temperatures will result in slower (or negligible) aging process than warmer temperatures. The results will certainly vary depending on the ABV and other qualities of the beer. Storing bottles horizontally should prevent the corks from drying.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Remember, that not all of the beers are suitable for aging. Mainly porter beer can be stored beyond expiration date (30 years!), but some others too. And i see no point for aging beer in a fridge.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That sounds pretty much like an ideal place to store and age beer and wine. 65F is maybe a tad on the warm side, but nowhere near the temperatures that would actually cook the beer and be harmful to it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is no harm in taking the bottles out from the fridge and in to your "cellar". And yes, leaving them in the fridge will not be good from an aging point of view and yes, the corks are likely to dry out in the fridge.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It won't hurt the beer to take it out of the fridge.  Work done by Dr. Charles Bamforth has suggested that every extra 10 degrees Celcius of temperate cuts doubles the speed of beer deterioration.  So, if you pull them out and store them at cellar temp (~55 F), they'll age about twice as fast.  Dark is definitely good. Higher humidity vertical storage is preferential to horizontal storage in a bottle conditioned beer, as you'll want particulate settling in the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can see an interview with Charlie &lt;a href="http://beersmith.com/blog/2014/01/31/flavor-stability-in-beer-with-dr-charlie-bamforth-beersmith-podcast-74/" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It depends on the beer style. Craft beers in general were not designed to be served at a near freezing (for water) temperature. Drink an IPA at 35 degrees and 45 degrees and you'll probably find the hop notes more pronounced at the higher temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is a general guideline:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Very Cold: 35-40 degrees
					•American Adjunct Lagers (“Macros”)
					•Malt Liquors
					•Light or low alcohol beers&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Cold: 40-45 degrees
					•Pilsner
					•Light-bodied lagers
					•Kolsch
					•Belgian Wit
					•Hefeweizen
					•Berliner weisse
					•American Wheat&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Cool: 45-50 degrees
					•American Pale Ales
					•Medium-bodied lagers
					•India Pale Ale (IPA)
					•Porters
					•Alt
					•Irish Stouts
					•Sweet Stout&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Cellar Temp: 50-55 degrees
					•Sour Ales
					•Lambic/Gueuze
					•English Bitter
					•Strong Ales
					•Baltic Porters
					•Bocks
					•Scotch Ales
					•Belgian Ales
					•Trappist Ales&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Warm: 55-60 degrees
					•Imperial Stouts
					•Belgian Quads
					•Belgian Strong Ales
					•Barley Wines
					•Old Ales
					•Dopplebock
					•Eisbock&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Freezing pint glasses is like using subwoofers in your Mini. It's too much of a good thing that drowns out the subtlety that is supposed to sell the product over and over. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Just because some beers taste better cold, such as lagers compared to ales, doesn't mean they taste better when they are nearly frozen at +1C. Our perception of flavour diminishes as something is cooled, and so beer tastes less sweet and wines taste more acidic as they get colder.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Breweries know this and they spend significant dollars to invent a beverage that has the maximum taste profile for the least amount of ingredient spend. Bringing that product out of its intended temperature zone and into numbness makes a Coors or Bud have almost no character at all.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I can also imagine that bars are going to be reluctant to cool their pint glasses and spend a lot of money on electricity when it makes the beers taste little better than ordinary ice water. The end result is a disappointing "freezie"-like experience that reduces the likelihood of someone ordering multiples of those over the course of an evening out, which is the ultimate benchmark for most bars.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer is meant to be stored in a cool, dark place. Light is indeed bad for it and causes "skunking" which produces literally the same chemical skunks produce.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Lots of times re-refrigerating beer implies the beer was left out. Was it left out in a place exposed to light? Particularly sunlight? It may not be the fact that it was exposed to higher temperatures that was the culprit, but the light. Warmer temperatures certainly seem like the most obvious offenders for a sub-par beer, but light is far more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Temperature for the most part should not be an issue. Anything from like 32-75 F should not be an issue, although somewhere between 45-55 F is the ideal cellaring temperature. To break the upper limit of safe temperatures pretty much requires you to leave the beer outdoors during a hot summer where it will likely be joined by the bigger threat of light.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Long story short: cellaring temperatures are for long-term (12 months+) storage and anything between freezing and high-end room temperature shouldn't have any adverse effects if stored someplace dark. The idea that beer needs to remain ice-cold from the moment the yeast is added is a bunch of BMC marketing BS.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;ol&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;UV light exposure causes negative effects (only a real problem for bottled beer).&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;UV light has a photochemical impact on hops. This causes it to have a flavor and aroma of a skunk. Brown bottles help lower the amount of UV light that can get to the beer, and with cans this is a non-issue.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;ol start="2"&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Extreme fluctuations in temperature are generally not good for the beer.&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Extreme temperature fluctuations could impact the flavor of any drink, but most likely will be too subtle to notice. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;ol start="3"&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Bottled beers can sometimes re-ferment at higher temperatures, causing over-carbonation.&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ol&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yeast needs sugars to ferment, by the time the bottle is on the shelves, the fermentable sugars are completely fermented and the yeast is in a dormant stage. However, this doesn't mean yeast cannot still affect the flavor of the beer. If the beer is &lt;a href="http://blog.beeriety.com/2009/08/03/what-is-bottle-conditioned-beer/" rel="nofollow"&gt;bottle conditioned&lt;/a&gt;, then it still has live yeast cultures and extra care should be taken to keep it below high temperatures (80+ F.) for long periods of time. You should not be concerned of it exploding (over carbonating), that only happens in homebrews where they added too much sugars or didn't sanitize everything properly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The majority of commercial beers are filtered to such a high degree that there is little to no live yeast to be concerned about. Some beers are even pasteurized to kill any remaining yeast, removing the possibility of it affecting flavor and extending its shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom line is, avoid temperature fluctuations as much as you can, but its not something you should throw away perfectly good beer for.&lt;/strong&gt; If you are a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supertaster" rel="nofollow"&gt;supertaster&lt;/a&gt; that can detect the subtle flavor changes, give it away to one of the 75% of us who are not.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For a full scientific study with facts and figures way over my head you can see: &lt;a href="http://www.academicjournals.org/article/article1380728686_Hiralal%20et%20al.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;Stability profile of flavour-active ester compounds in
					ale and lager beer during storage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's just marketing.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Lager fermentations are very clean so it tends to be a beer you want to drink in a warm and humid climate.  The breweries want to make beer that will sell very well locally, and that just happens to be lagers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;At a commercial scale brewers are investing in temperature control regardless of ale or lager, so it's not a significant expense or savings one way or another.  So since they're spending the money anyway, might as well brew what people will buy more of.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From the consumer perspective, it's cheaper to buy from a local company than it is to buy an imported beer in most cases.  So the local beer sells better than the import.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Lagers tend to be more popular as they taste better colder, and are 'easier drinking' than heavier, more flavourful beers, and taste good very cold or with ice, so better for quenching thirst in the heat.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, stouts and darker heavier beers are often popular in rural areas in tropical Asia where ice is unavailable - think &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/727/5551/" rel="nofollow"&gt;ABC Extra Stout&lt;/a&gt;, Beer Laos Dark, Guinness Foreign Extra Stout, or &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1885/12773/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Black Panther&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The basic rule is that beers should be served at the temp they were fermented. Lagers should be served at about 40°F and ales around 50°F - 55°F.  Having said this I usually like my beers a little colder on a warm summer day. Try this experiment:  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;chill your beer to 35°F - 40°F and pour about 2/3 of it into the proper glass for that beer. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Drink at least 4 or 5 sips, gulps, or however you typically consume it. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Then put what is left in the microwave for about 20 seconds (time will vary with the output of the microwave).  This will reduce the carbonation some so pour the other third right in the middle of the glass without tipping the glass to get some head, on the beer that is. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It makes a big difference on some beers. less on others. Also try different types of glasses and see what you like. Remember, everybody's palates are different and yours will vary depending on several factors such as, what you've been eating or drinking, how much beer you've already consumed, and how tired you are. It's a good idea to eat a bite or two of good bread like a baguette to cleanse your palate between samples. The above does not apply to mass produced lagers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beers that are high in ABV, have been bottle-conditioned or have been barrel-aged are prime for aging and cellaring. Usually the brewer will say on the bottle or their website what the max amount of suggested aging time is. For instance, Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout state "develops over 5 years in the bottle." I bought a case of 2012 and have one about every 6 months...and they get better and better.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;They should have been kept at about 50-55 degrees over the time of aging. What did you have them at?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's always going to be a matter of preference. I prefer most beers around 55-60 but do not hesitate to drink beer at room temperature. Some styles are more enjoyable approaching room temperature. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Historically, most beer was served at cellar temperature to room temperature, depending upon what was available. That isn't just an English tradition. Any beer can be consumed warm and drinking it ice cold as mass produced lagers are usually served tends to hide most of the flavor that you are paying for in a good beer. Give it a try and see what you like. Maybe you don't like your beer a little warmer. Enjoy what you like.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You need to pour carefully as normally you have quite thick tankage and/or parts of kvass (sometimes bread pieces and crumbs if it`s homemade one) can float in it. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My ancestors (and still my relatives) use limestone cellar to keep temperature-sensitive goods (including kvass) and the cellar`s floor is 3 meters below their ground level. At summer it's chilling cold down there and the Internet says the temperatures there fall into range of 5-10 degrees celsius (pretty much the temperature in a fridge). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Kvass is one of the best beverages for hot summer and if brewed good it`s as tasty as beer and contains almost no alcohol so you can continue doing any type of work you've been doing prior to drinking it (beer does not really have this wonderful feature). However the best one is hand-made at home as kvass sold in supermarkets is not good and sometimes it differs drastically (imagine a difference between a home-made lemonade from a restaurant and any bottle of one from a supermarket).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think kvas tastes best when it is cold. In Moscow, say, when you are walking around in the summer, you see many stands with cooled containers where you can buy it. This type of kvas is not bad, but the best kvas is often made by some monastery &lt;a href="http://www.stsl.ru/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;like the one in Sergiev Posad&lt;/a&gt; - see the photo. The difference to standard types is huge.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My first temptation is to say none.  However there are two mitigation strategies to this dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The first is mulled beer, you need a light IPA, a saucepan, cinnamon and star anise.  Put the beer in the pan, add the spices and heat.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The second strategy, and one I've used, is camp near a stream.  Store the beer in the stream in a net bag or similar.  Any beer works in this situation and it will cool the beer to a drinking temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Somewhat related: &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/q/5/73"&gt;What temperature should I serve my beer?&lt;/a&gt; In short, beers don't need to be served as cold as many are led to believe, and darker beers tend to be meant to serve warmer (as warm as 55°F). You certainly don't want to drink warm Coors, so maybe bring along some stouts.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In case there isn't a stream around to do what @user23614 suggests, bring some newspapers. Wet a sheet of newspaper and wrap the bottle with a single layer. Leave the bottle somewhere the breeze can blow on it, until most of the water evaporates. This is probably a common camping trick, but I first saw Moroccans in the Sahara Desert do this to chill a bottle of wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;at room temperature the flavour of the beer starts to intensify,some people would say it gets more bitter.
					I tried something that worked ..there a beers like Kingfisher Light...that have pretty good carbonation content.
					So even at room temperature u get a good time.You can try any other beer that has strong carbonation..and LITTLE mild in flavour.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Short answer: no beer that has color-changing mountains on the side should be served warm, otherwise you'll taste it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Long answer: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, ales are traditional served warmer than pilseners, so start your selection there. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Second consideration is sweet/bitter balance. Sweetness generally becomes &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7070/abs/nature04248.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;stronger&lt;/a&gt; with warmer beer. Something with a bit of sour would probably hold up well when warm. At the same time, styles that are meant to be sweet are usually served at/close to room temp: barleywines, or anything imperial/double/doppel/strong. Bonus: you won't have to carry as much.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Third: can you get it in a can? Cleaning up that campsite will be so much easier the next morning...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Repeatedly cooling and warming (to ambient temperatures) a beer can induce a permanent haze, where proteins and tannins bond to create semi-soluble molecules. While this can have an aesthetic impact, it does not impact flavour, aroma or mouthfeel. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is mostly an issue in beers where the knocking-out, or rapid cooling of the beer may not have been effective at precipitating what is known as cold-break proteins. Which generally leads to chill haze (haze when the beer is cool, but not when it is warm). This generally isn't an issue with most commercial beers (especially if filtered), and is more often found in home-brewed beers. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Cooling and warming a beer &lt;strong&gt;does have an effect&lt;/strong&gt;, but it is minor in the beginning. If you heat, cool, repeatedly many times, there will be evidence of damage and it will become staggeringly obvious!
					At Budweizer they gave us a beer that was cycled over a 100 times! It was shocking how many off-flavours such a delicately flavoured beer can get!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Tough one to answer...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Since all sour ales have a very low pH, the sour flavor will be present no matter the serving temperature.  With that in mind, the subtle notes of the beer will probably require  the beer to be warmer than most beers when serving.  I would recommend a cellar temperature, about 55F (12C) to bring out the best combination of flavor and drinkablity.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The best advice I've ever heard on sour beers is from the tour at New Belgium Brewery:   Take a sip and think for a few seconds about what the beer is trying to tell you then take another sip.  If the second was better than the first, take a third.  If the third was better than the second then keep going.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Never be afraid to try new brews.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It won't hurt you, lactose (the 'key' ingredient of milk stouts) doesn't need to be refrigerated the way actual milk does. However, it is advisable to keep milk stouts refrigerated for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;1) They generally don't age particularly well, so keeping them in the fridge will best preserve the taste.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;2) If a milk stout isn't pasteurized the lactose can provide unfermented carbohydrates for infections to feast on if any bacteria is present. But keeping it in the fridge will drastically slow down any potential infection.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.seniorcitizensguide.com/articles/activities/wine-tips.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wine experts&lt;/a&gt; advise that white wines be served at 45 to 55 degrees Fahrenheit, light reds at about 60 degrees and more complex reds at "room temperature" or 65 to 70 degrees. [Remember, the phrase "room temperature" predates the days of central heat and air conditioning, so it generally refers to the "cellar" temperature of an earlier era.]&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Chilling helps preserve and highlight fresh, fruity flavors of varieties like Riesling, Pinot Gris and Gewürztraminer. Chardonnay, on the other hand, though white, is more complex, is fermented and aged in oak barrels and thus is usually served at the upper end of the 'white' scale.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Full-bodied Cabernets should be served in the 70 degree range. The warmer temperature allows the complexity of intense reds to come through as they are swirled, sipped and savored. Lighter reds like chambourcin or merlot are less complex, so are best appreciated just slightly chilled.
					Full-bodied Cabernets should be served in the 70 degree range. The warmer temperature allows the complexity of intense reds to come through as they are swirled, sipped and savored.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In planning a festive gathering, consider several ways to attain the "correct" wine temperature. Refrigeration will decrease a bottle's temperature 4 to 5 degrees each half hour in the first 60-90 minutes. After that, temperatures will drop 2-3 degrees per half hour. Riesling should be chilled for 4 or 5 hours, a chardonnay for 1-2 hours, merlot for an hour and cabernets for a half hour or less. If time is short, a freezer will drop the temperature about 6-8 degrees every fifteen minutes. However, it is best to set a kitchen timer in the event the party is so festive that you forget and find a broken bottle of very fine wine in your freezer the next morning."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wines.com/sweet-wines.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sweet Moscato&lt;/a&gt; and Moscato d'Asti wines are very good served chilled on their own as a refreshing summertime wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As with all alcoholic beverages there should be no issues drinking them cold, warm or even hot. The alcohol pretty much kills any nasty things. There may be some flavor issues. Flavors are more pronounced when the liquid is warmer as the volatile compounds that make up the flavors are more easily released but that is not necessarily a good thing in terms of flavor. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I can only speak for whiskies as I use to sell and give out samples of that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of things to understand first about whiskies.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the aging process of the whisky, the whisky is placed in a barrel to add flavour to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the alcohol percent is below 40%, the whisky has a hard time retaining the flavour of the barrel. This is not impossible but it is easier if it is 40% or higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The reason why there is &lt;em&gt;on the rocks&lt;/em&gt; vs &lt;em&gt;neat&lt;/em&gt; is due to this 40% alcohol threshold. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you add ice, it will dilute the whisky below 40% alcohol content which will allow the flavours to "pop out" more. This is really good for new whisky drinkers trying to understand "how to taste" whiskies. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So for whiskies, it is not so much about cooling the drink but rather allowing the flavours of the barrel to be more prominent to the drinker. For veteran whisky drinkers, they may not need the ice and prefer it at room temperature and thus, they would not want it cold.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a bartender and bar manager for 10+ years at a very busy bar several reasons are obvious to me.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not everyone wants a cold drink.  It is easy to chill warm liquor quickly.  On the other hand there is no readily available method to warm chilled liquor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for having a copy of each liquor on display/ room temperature, logistically and financially it's infeasible for most bars/ restaurant and massively inefficient for larger establishments or commercial chains.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In your mind's eye picture how many bottles you might see on display, then picture how much space you need to store them.  Another problem becomes apparent.  On display there may be 30-100 bottles of liquor lined up in a way that their labels are visible.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This does not maximize storage space, but having the label visible serves two primary purposes:
					1. Customers can easily see what's available and
					2. Perhaps more importantly, especially for busy bars, the bartender can quickly find and grab a bottle when needed.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the bottles are stored in fridges, either top or front open, they will need to be stored one in the front of the other to best fill the space.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;An important axiom in restaurants is that your peak business is constrained by how many customers you can serve at once. Having to open doors every time you wish to pour a drink is a massive time sink. Perhaps if only 1 or 2 drinks were made every 10 minutes then it would be trivial, but if bartender needs to make 3+ drinks a minute(and a good owner will build to support busy times), or if 3 or more bartenders need to do this, then the 4-30 seconds seconds it takes to open the door find the the bottle, and/or clear bar path obstructions this causes add up to massive increases in wait time.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Moderately Busy bar with well-skilled bartenders scenario:
					4 bartenders making 3 drinks each per minute = ~12 customers served per minute.
					Goal- guests greeted in 30 seconds, drinks delivered with a minute of greet time.  Why? This is roughly the time window for someone to feel they got great bar service.  This is a widely upheld service standard.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Each drink takes 20 seconds to make.  Add 4 seconds to each drink and also assume that sometimes there will be wait at the door to get the correct liquor, or the open door is blocking the path.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Possible cost of having a door: the door can add (3 drinks x 4 seconds)x 3 bartenders = 36 seconds every minute to each bartender. More than a 50% increase to serve 12 customers. The service standard can not be met and the number of people served per minute with the same staff falls considerably to ~7 (12/96=.125 guests per second *60 seconds = 7.5 guests per minute) &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This could problem could be mitigated by increasing the size of the bar to hold shallow, but long refrigerators that have sliding doors and allow for alcohol to be seen and easily grabbed.  However, this does not solve the problem of people who don't want ice and it costs a considerable amount more in square footage, and refrigeration cost.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And of course all of these concerns are easily answerable with using scooped ice versus refrigerators.  &lt;strong&gt;Scooped ice is elegant, refrigerating all the bottles is a kluge.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Good logistics and bar design do a lot of work towards serving customers in a bar and towards reaching profitability.  With elite logistics you only need average bartenders to create excellent service.  Add elite bartenders to elite logistics and you create world-class service.  On the other hand poor logistics can make elite bartenders seem only average and make average bartenders nearly worthless.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One last thing: &lt;strong&gt;Adding ice adds to perceived value with very little relative cost.&lt;/strong&gt; The glass size can be doubled and still be filled with the same amount of liquor.  While in truth you are getting the same volume of alcohol and/or mixer it appears like you are getting more add the cost of a penny or less for the ice.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A site that has a lot of useful information is &lt;a href="https://www.craftbeer.com/beer-styles" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;craftbeer.com&lt;/a&gt;. By going to the beer styles section, you will see the beer style information, including serving temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you want to go more in depth, you can get training from &lt;a href="https://www.cicerone.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Cicerone&lt;/a&gt;. They are a company that train bar staff on the the correct way to serve beer (temp, glasses,food pairing, etc) as well as information about the beer styles, brewing process and more.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I like all light beers room temp.. Always have... I ask my local bar tender to pull a bucket 1/2 hour before i come in and keep it out !! ( i call ahead and tip well) but always drink the bucket.. If not give the beers away so he doesn't re chill them and ruin them..... Is this strange??&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer is best to be drank at the temperature of 10C, but there are no real testing done on beer at room temp. You must do it yourself. It is pretty hard job to do   LOL.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Refrigeration has little to do with preservation.  As a food product beer and NA beer are pretty strictly regulated for safety so as long as the rubber in the cap maintains a seal it should stay sterile.  Refrigeration is mostly for taste and carbonation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Storage temperature absolutely effects the quality of beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;High storage temperatures can produce Dimethyl Sulfide - a cooked corn/vegetable like favour.  Also high temperatures can cause the breakdown of yeast (autolyzation) contributing meaty/vegemite/marmite/miso like off flavours. 
					Ref: &lt;a href="https://www.beercartel.com.au/blog/beer-storage-the-dos-and-donts-of-storing-and-cellaring-beer/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.beercartel.com.au/blog/beer-storage-the-dos-and-donts-of-storing-and-cellaring-beer/&lt;/a&gt;
					(There are many other references if you search.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The storage time at the temperature is obviously also a factor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The changes also depend on the type of beer being stored.  If the beer is a pasteurised and/or completely filtered product, typically all yeast and suspended proteins have been removed.  Yeast can't autolyze if they have been removed.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hop-forward beers will lose their flavour, "hoppiness" much quicker if stored warm - even when stored properly, it's best to drink these beers sooner rather than cellar them.  I keep all my hoppy beers refrigerated at all times (handle them like dairy products).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a rule of thumb, cellar your beers around 10C / 50F without much variation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally, I only buy what I can keep in the refrigerator as a stable 10C is impossible where I live.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While "Wayne in Yak" pretty much covers ideal serving temperatures, I would like to add some sensory information.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When you drink or eat very cold foods &amp;amp; beverages, the low temperature inhibits the operation of your taste buds and other olfactory tasting parts of your body.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here's a quick experiment: taste a room-temperature soda/soft-drink Vs a refrigerated soft drink.  The warm version tastes much sweeter.  The sweetness of the beverage is calibrated for consumption at a low temperature.  It's too sweet drinking it warm.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sometimes on hot summer days, a cold &amp;amp; frosty beer is great.  I wont disagree there.  But the point is - if the beverage is &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; cold, you physically can't taste it very well.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is why many establishments do not freeze their glasses.  Just like steaks, soup and ice-cream, there's a specific temperature range at which the producer thinks the product is best.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In places where the ambient temperature is over 30C / 86F, then it makes sense to cool the glasses.  But here the idea here is that when the beverage at temperature-X is combined with a heavy glass at temperature-Y, the final resultant temperature should be in that ideal serving range.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Split it into small aluminum containers and store it in the fridge. Fill it to the top so there is very little air in the container.  You can find kid sized 12 oz water bottles on sell for just a few bucks.  It should last weeks but best used in one week.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is also suction pumps and nitrogen.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Temperature for drinking is personal taste.&lt;/p&gt;
