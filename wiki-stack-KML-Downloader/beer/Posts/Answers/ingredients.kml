					&lt;p&gt;Some beer use animal by-products in their production.  Guinness is popular example: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isinglass"&gt;isinglass&lt;/a&gt;, a swim bladder, is as a filter or fining agent.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are two main ingredients in beer that might cause them to be unsuitable for vegans. The first one might be fairly obvious. Honey is sometimes used as a sweetener, especially in meade, but certainly in other beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, the main cause is a fining agent called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isinglass"&gt;Isinglass&lt;/a&gt; that is made from ground swim bladders of fish.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As you might expect, it's all got to do with the ingredients. I'm a vegetarian myself, but not a vegan. So I do eat honey and dairy. With that said, some beers would not be considered vegan if they use those ingredients (milk stouts for instance use lactose).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, an example of a non-vegetarian beer would be the oyster stout, which uses oysters in the brewing process. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes.  Typically chocolate stout does contain chocolate.  I've typically added chocolate to my home-brew during the boil phase (since it adds more sugars and I want the chocolate to melt).  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It depends on the brew really; some do and others do not. More often than not, the chocolate flavor comes from the techniques used to roast the malts rather than chocolate itself. Some brewers will add additional chocolate to enhance the chocolate flavor a bit, but it generally doesn't get its flavor primarily from the chocolate. The same is true for coffee stouts.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a side note, I've recently tried a smoked imperial IPA (Runaway Smoked Ferry Imperial IPA) from the Port Jeff Brewing Company, a local microbrewery. I swear to God, it tasted like bacon! But there was not an ounce of bacon in it as confirmed by the brewmaster. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In addition to the answers given above, some specialty beers include animal products as well.  I have had beer made with oyster broth for example.  That one is definitely not vegan.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Interestingly in the Middle Ages, they used to brew with chicken broth sometimes, and some other times with dairy products (including either milk or whey).  That is worth remembering in terms of why some specialty beers include meat products as well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;At the most basic you need:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;A grain, somehow modified to ferment with yeast (see below)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Water&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Yeast&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Other additives to impart flavor and help preserve the brew (hops or gruit usually).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The grains are usually malted but note that rice doesn't malt using the normal process, so typically with rice beers you have some other process for extracting starches (most typically you have another culture which breaks down starches into sugars).  Grains historically used in brewing include:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;barley (the standard today)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;rye&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;wheat&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;rice (most common in Asia).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;corn&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;millet  (common in Africa and probably early Asia before being supplanted by rice)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;oats&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;buckwheat&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For the other additives, the most common is hops, but other ones in commercial brewing include:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;heather flowers&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;alecost&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;pine needles&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;spruce needles&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;sweet gale&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;juniper berries&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Grains of paradise&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Historically the following were also added, but not so much anymore.  Experienced, adventuresome, and/or foolish home-brewers may use these (foolish, if they do this without some understanding or experience of the potential ramifications):&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;mugwort &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;henbane (this was historically a really, really big one but has signficant toxicity and contraindications medically)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;bog rosemary&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have experimented with gruits containing the following which are not historically attested to my knowledge:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;damask rose petals (gruit also containing hops)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;lavender (probably would be great with juniper berries but didn't have any)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sometimes fruit and/or honey is also added.  Sometimes corn sugar (fructose) is added.  I have also seen other flavoring like garlic and chili peppers added to beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sometimes animal products are included.  Historically the big ones were milk, whey, and chicken broth.  Today, however, those ones are rarely if ever used.  There are cases of oyster broth added, as well as isinglass (made from swim bladders of fish).  Sometimes icelandic moss (an algae) is added as a clarifying agent.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That should be a fairly complete list however assuming you aren't going further afield into other traditional malt liquors.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's hard to say either way unless we find a primary source (someone privy to the company's strategies), but I think a refinement of your question might be—&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Are any ingredients for brewing either unavailable or prohibitively expensive depending on season?&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I doubt this is the case—if an ingredient were impractical to obtain in other seasons but one, then I'd imagine the price of that seasonal beer would be extraordinary, which isn't the case with Sam Adams' seasonal beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If by chance there &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; exist such ingredients, then the next question is—are any of those ingredients used in Sam Adams' seasonal beers, which itself is a difficult question, since Sam Adams' recipes are proprietary. From Sam Adams' site, though,&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Samuel Adams® Octoberfest is a malt lover's dream, masterfully blending together five roasts of barley to create a delicious harmony of sweet flavors including caramel and toffee. The beer is kept from being overly sweet by the elegant bitterness imparted by the German Noble hops.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Unless one of those "five roasts of barley" (providing the above is even true and not a marketing statement itself) is some rarity in other seasons, which I highly doubt, again, I'd say mass produced seasonal beers are only "seasonal" for the sake of marketing and inducing a certain feel—&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Samuel Adams® Octoberfest provides a wonderful transition from the lighter beers of summer to the winter's heartier brews.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I feel guilty posting this as an answer, since, it's not a definitive answer, but I don't feel the question &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be answered by anyone but a primary source, so perhaps this question should be closed instead—but I don't know what the appropriate reason would be.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A few notes on brewing and the seasons.  It isn't a question of availability today but there are other factors that likely have seasonal impact.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Traditionally (say, 1000 years ago), yes, brewing recipes would vary with the seasons.  Some ingredients like henbane seed or barley keep extremely well.  Others do better  fresh (herbs and such).  It is likely that gruit components varied with the seasons.  This is not an issue today.  Aside from some components of other beers (pumpkin ale, beers with seasonal fruit), most beers today do not involve ingredients that are problematic to preserve over a year.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is a second issue though.  That is that beers traditionally have another factor which is starch content.  The starch contributes significantly to calorie count of the beer, and usually darker, richer beers have higher carbohydrate count.  It makes sense to consume more calories in cold weather than warm weather, and it makes sense that darker, heavier beers would be favored in winter while lighter beers would be favored in summer (although as one would note the heavier beers came out of traditions of using them as bread substitutes for fasting monks and so would have year-round applicability in monasteries).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I don't think it has to do with availability.  I think instead it has to do with seasonal expectations and reserving richer, heavier, higher starch beers for the winter (we have higher metabolism in winter, see &lt;a href="http://www.mate.tue.nl/mate/pdfs/4319.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.mate.tue.nl/mate/pdfs/4319.pdf&lt;/a&gt;, and generally less availability of fresh foods before modern refrigeration and rapid transport).  I don't know when this became common though.  In general, when I look back a thousand years ago, I don't see anything in primary sources to suggest heavier malts in the winter.  So trying to date this would seem speculative.  There is a fairly obvious practical pattern though.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;:  As I think about this, I would note that aside from lagers, it is very hard to brew in the winter in a colder climate.  There may also be a component where heavier, stronger beers keep better and therefore keep into the winter better.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With regards to the beer, 4 things primarily determine the amount and consistency of head:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Types of malt used: light malt typically produces larger, more dish-soapy bubbles. Roasted or dark malts will typically produce smaller bubbles. The proteins in the malt are what determine the consistency of the bubbles. There are additives that can alter and enhance the head forming capabilities of the beer. These are usually forms of protein. One of the best silky mouth feel beers I've ever had is Flying Dog Pearl Necklace Oyster Stout. Yes - they actually add oysters to the brew. The protein makes for an amazing feel.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Amount of carbonation: pretty self explanatory. Mo' gas, mo' bubbles. Higher ABV beers and very malty beers can sometimes hold almost no CO2. Give these a rough pour to produce a decent head.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Type of carbonation: CO2 produces larger bubbles while nitrogen produces very fine small bubbles which gives Guinness its famous silky creamy head.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Conditioning &amp;amp; storage: bottle conditioned beer will hold more CO2 and have a different head and mouth feel and coarser bubbles. kegs carbonated by pressurizing with CO2 will hold less and be a bit foamier.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With regards to the pour, if less head is desired, tilt the glass at least 45 degrees and pour slowly, on the glass, rising as you pour to always be pouring just above the level of the beer. For more head, well... dump 'er in.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The glass will make a difference too. For some high-browed beer-snobbery about cleaning your beer glasses: &lt;a href="http://byo.com/porter/item/425-can-you-explain-the-dos-and-donts-of-cleaning-beer-glasses"&gt;http://byo.com/porter/item/425-can-you-explain-the-dos-and-donts-of-cleaning-beer-glasses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A rye beer is any beer that incorporates rye, usually malted rye. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much Rye and how it tastes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are no laws to state that the quantity of rye should be above some minimum, so some rye beers include just a few percent of the malt bill as rye, while others such as Roggenbier base their entire flavor profile on rye, using over 50% rye malt. With such a large difference in the grain bill and the amount of rye, the two beers taste very different.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When rye is added to beer between 10-20% of the grain bill, it gives a pleasant spiciness and bread-like quality to the beer that blends well with most hop types, particularly spicy or citrussy hops. Rye can also add some dryness to the aftertaste.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Above 20% the spiciness becomes progressively more assertive and the beer fuller, more earthy and hearty, and perhaps not unsurprisingly, tastes similar to rye bread.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Var-rye-ation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Rye beers show considerable variation. Rye is a versatile ingredient, which has become increasingly popular recently with craft brewers, so there is no longer a common theme underlying rye beers, other than the rye itself. In fact, even the rye can vary. New malts are appearing, such as &lt;a href="http://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/index.php?_a=viewProd&amp;amp;productId=29"&gt;crystal rye&lt;/a&gt; which give a new flavor dimension to beers - crystal rye provides some of the spiciness of malted rye with dark fruits, and a pleasant dryness in the finish. This means the brewer can make a rye beer from:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;malted rye&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;flaked (unmalted) rye&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;crystal rye&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Rye is becoming at least as versatile as wheat, if not in fact more so. While most Wheat beers focus on the esters and phenolics produced by the yeast (banana/clove), Rye beers have the freedom to exploit the full spectrum of beer flavors and are not constrained by adherence to a particular style entrenched in tradition. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But will you like some other rye beer having tried one?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you don't like the taste of rye in beer, then there's a good chance you won't like most rye beers, since the rye flavor is most likely going to be present. However, if you do like the taste of rye, there is still no saying up front that you will like any rye beer simply due to the diversity of beers that can be brewed with rye.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bacon Beer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've heard of beers made with rauchmalt - smoked malt, where the brewer has "&lt;a href="http://byo.com/stories/issue/item/569-dry-hopping-techniques"&gt;dry hopped&lt;/a&gt;" with bacon or bacon flavored soya to give the beer a bacon flavor and aroma - allowing the bacon and the smoked malt to enhance each other. One commercial example is &lt;a href="https://rogue.com/beers/voodoo-bacon-maple.php"&gt;Bacon Maple Ale&lt;/a&gt; from Rogue, which features a variety of smoked malts (over different woods) plus applewood smoked bacon.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cock Ale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071209115313AAbFnmq"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a recipe for ale made with chicken broth:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;PERIOD: England, 17th century | SOURCE: The Closet Of the Eminently
					  Learned Sir Kenelme Digby Kt. Opened, 1677 | CLASS: Authentic &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;DESCRIPTION: A drink of ale, chicken broth, &amp;amp; sack &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;To make Cock-Ale. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Take eight gallons of Ale, take a Cock and boil him well; then take
					  four pounds of Raisins of the Sun well stoned, two or three Nutmegs,
					  three or four flakes of Mace, half a pound of Dates; beat these all in
					  a Mortar, and put to them two quarts of the best Sack: and when the
					  Ale hath done working, put these in, and stop it close six or seven
					  days, and then bottle it, and a month after you may drink it.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And PS: the Guinness meat story because of finding rats in the fermentation tanks or barrels is a myth. Or to put it another way, even if it did ever did happen once, it's not practiced now. It's hard enough for bacteria to get into the fermentation tanks or barrels, let alone something as big as a rat! (Nowadays they use stainless or aluminum kegs.) &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another example is &lt;strong&gt;oyster stout&lt;/strong&gt;.  While some breweries today use the name for beers that don't contain oysters, it was originally brewed with oysters.  It seems that the style grew out of the popular food pairing of stout and oysters, leading to attempts to combine the two, starting in New Zealand in 1929.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One example of a modern brewery using oysters is &lt;a href="http://www.porterhousebrewco.com/beers-oyster.php"&gt;Porterhouse Brewing Company in Ireland&lt;/a&gt;.  More information on the style can be found in &lt;a href="http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000740.html"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A recent release by an Icelandic brewery actually contains whale meat, and inevitably this has been quite controversial!
					&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/13/whale-meat-beer_n_4591258.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Whale Meat Beer From Icelandic Brewery Stirs Up Controversy, Outrages Conservationists.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'd like to try it myself but it's not for export and the only way I could afford to get to Iceland anytime soon would be canoe. Seems a bit chilly out for that, though.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Guinness, in common with some other beers, does actually involve a meat product in the brewing process, specifically the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isinglass"&gt;swim bladders of fish&lt;/a&gt;. This substance is not nominally retained in the final beverage.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Generally you won't find coriander or other spices added to hefeweizen beers, due to the traditional &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinheitsgebot"&gt;beer purity law&lt;/a&gt;.

					&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure whether by Hefeweizen, you mean German white beer? or any white beer?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am no beer expert, but in Belgium, the famous Hoegaarden does use coriander as a spice for the beer, it gives that imitation-hoppy flavor. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoegaarden_Brewery" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoegaarden_Brewery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;No.  An adjunct is simply an ingredient that is not strictly necessary to brew the beer.  In some cases the purpose of the adjunct is to reduce costs, while in others it is to achieve certain flavours (e.g. in honey beers, or various spiced beers).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If cost is the primary concern, then GMO ingredients may be picked if they are cheapest.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When adjuncts are used for flavour, cost is not going to be the primary concern so it would be incorrect to assume that a GMO source would be picked by default.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The chances of corn being grown for industrial purposes, like making dextrose have a very high probability of being GMO. If you are buying specialty grains (like for steeping), the probability of those ingredients being genetically modified are much lower. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, finding out whether or not your adjunct is made from GMO corn (or rice) is very difficult. You may be able to find companies that market things as GMO-free, in that case, they are &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; GMO free. Otherwise, they may or may not contain GMOs. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are concerned about the safety of genetic modification, you should know that GMOs are very safe and are tested for safety much more than the wild crops their genes are borrowed from. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First of all, GMO seem to be getting a bad reputation, as opposed to the hormones that are given to animals, like dairy cows.  In general, GMOs are safe.  In fact, modifying plants' properties and features to something that the farmer wants is been going on for thousands of years (it's how we got broccoli from a plant that looked more like kale).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, many of the Light Lagers (BJCP Styles 1A, 1B and 1C) have adjuncts like corn and rice (as much as 40% of the total grain bill), both of which are notorious for having many varieties that are GMO.  One of the reasons for this is that it allows the brewer to brew a high ABV beer and add water back to bring the ABV down to whatever the local laws say are the maximum without being labeled with the ABV.  Large breweries will manufacture in one state and sell their product in many states.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have noticed that some beer labels list GMO free rather prominently, however, if a GMO free lifestyle is something you're interested in, I would stick to beers that have ONLY Barley, Hops, Water and Yeast as ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;According the Briess, a very large maltster, website:
					[B]ecause malt is made from whole grain and minimally processed, it is an all natural ingredient that helps achieve product claims like natural, healthy, Kosher and non-GMO.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Well, brewers typically control pH during the fermentation process top avoid unwanted bacterial growth, etc., fermentation actually doesn't even happen below ~4. So not a significant difference.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sure, there are major differences in acidity. Unsurprisingly, the sour beer styles can have very low pH levels. &lt;a href="http://www.themadfermentationist.com/2011/11/measuring-sour-beer-ph.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Here's&lt;/a&gt; an example of someone measuring the pH of sour beers and finding that even within that category there are significant differences. &lt;a href="http://www.weyermann.de/downloads/pdf/Weyermann_TKW_Mash-pH_2010.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;Here's&lt;/a&gt; a short presentation showing that expected pH ranges from 3.2-3.4 for Berliner Weisse to 4.5-4.8 for pilsner and bock. So, yes, there are definitely major differences, and they do matter to the perception of the finished product. At the most obvious level, low-pH beers actually taste sour. There are also indications that smaller pH variations matter to how people perceive the flavour.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That very much depends on the brewery. Some use cocoa nibs to add the chocolate flavor, but often they use what are called "chocolate malt", grain that is roasted until it's the color of chocolate. These happen to add a fair amount of chocolate and coffee characteristics to the final product.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can certainly brew beer at home that is similar to a commercial recipe, but unlikely one that will pass for exactly the same thing.  First, the exact recipes are trade-secrets, and while you can guess at the quantities of ingredients, boil times, etc, you likely won't get them exactly the same.  Additionally, the ingredients you use aren't going to be exactly the same, and by far the biggest difference is likely to be in the water.  The mineral content in your water will be different from theirs, for instance, and this will have an effect on the flavor.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, brewing beer shouldn't be able slavishly replicating something you find on the store shelves...It should be about experimenting until you find the recipe that is perfect for your particular tastes. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's possible to make almost any beer at home; this hobby is known as Home Brewing and even has a Stack Exchange Community around the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most beer falls into two major categories: ales and lagers. Ales are easier to make at home because the beer can ferment at temperatures that do not require special equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Budweiser is a lager; lager beers require additional equipment to keep the beers fermenting at very specific low temperatures. So while it is certainly possible to make beers like Budweiser at home, few choose to do so because of the added expense and level of difficulty of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Any time you mix things into beer you'll lose some carbonation. Any powder would nucleate bubbles very quickly, so the flavoring should be in liquid form. The liquid should be as similar to beer possible: cold, equally carbonated, and not too much alcohol if it can be avoided. Stir gently in a cold glass and serve right away.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Or, if you are brewing the beer yourself just add it at kegging or bottling time.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are products called Randalizers that can allow you to infuse flavors into beer as it's served. Provided that the beer is 1) on draft, and 2) the flavoring is a solid (hops, peppercorns, citrus peel, etc). An expensive option is the &lt;a href="http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/blichmann-hoprocket.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Blichman Hoprocket&lt;/a&gt;. Another option I've seen, but I'm not sure how to construct it, was an inline water filter that had been modified. That modified filter also required significantly more CO2 to maintain pressure, I don't think that was true of the purpose built devices.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These work well for fresh flavors, but would serve poorly if you were looking for anything else. I've had beers run through a couple different combinations of herbs, fruit, veggies, and hops, and it was always interesting and exciting. Even if it wasn't always that good.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Effectively, yes.  A sour beer is what we'd consider to be a spoiled beer.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a quick primer, "wort" is turned into "beer" when microbes convert the sugars in the liquid into alcohol, CO2, and ...other stuff.  Generally speaking, we use brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces Cerevisiae for ale or Sacc. Pastorianus for lager) because the other stuff tastes pretty nice, or at least doesn't taste bad.  Various strains of the same organism produce different byproducts, an example would be an English ale yeast which is well known for compounds that are kindof sweet or fruity vs Belgian ale yeasts which are well known for being peppery, clovy, or banana-y.  Those flavors all come from the yeast used for fermentation, but it's only ever a single strain of yeast, which was isolated in a lab.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sour beers are basically defined by not using a single isolated, clean-tasting strain of Saccharomyces.  The most common sour yeast used is in a genus called Brettanomyces, which depending on the specific species can produce flavors like...horse saddle, bandaid, cheese, cloves, and vinegar.  But most sour beers are not strictly brewed with yeasts like Sacc. or Brett. but also have bacteria in them.  Most commonly lactobacillus and pediococcus which are known for producing large amounts of lactic acid, which is where the sour really comes from.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That's not to say sour beer brewers are being sloppy, because their "infections" aren't accidents.  They're deliberately trying to use less predictable and slow-acting organisms to create consistent beer.  That's tough.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As to a suggestion?  I like Tart of Darkness by The Bruery.  Petrus is good stuff and Duchesse de Bourgogne is nice.  Occasionally it's nice to find a really tart Berlinerweisse and mix it with a fruit syrup and Gose can be incredible paired with cheese.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sourness may have been, in a higher or lower level, a common characteristic of beers centuries ago, specially after some time of storage, once the common vessel to keep it was wooden barrels, and wood often harbor a lot of microorganisms, including bacteria and wild yeast, the former being responsible for souring the beer. After the Industrial Revolution, with more hygiene and sterile tools, that characteristic became more and more uncommon, and at some point, undesirable. So, meanwhile, yeast was "discovered", isolated, and fermentation controlled so that we had a clean taste profile, free from acids at all, which is what you know as beer nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Don't be fooled: &lt;strong&gt;what really sours a beer are bacteria, not &lt;em&gt;Brettanomyces&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The later, also known as 'wild yeast', are usually found in sour beers as well, but are responsible for other aromas and flavors (barnyard and horse saddle being the most recognizable). (&lt;em&gt;Brett&lt;/em&gt; actually produces a tiny amount of acid, no more than that).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some Belgians have been intentionally making sour beers for centuries, through spontaneous fermentation process (in the case of &lt;em&gt;lambics&lt;/em&gt;) and wood-aging (in large oak vats) after "clean" fermentation (in the case of &lt;em&gt;flanders reds&lt;/em&gt;). Germans did it too, but their two traditional sour styles (&lt;em&gt;gose&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;berliner weisse&lt;/em&gt;) are almost dead there, and differ from the belgians ones on the absence of &lt;em&gt;brett&lt;/em&gt; character.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, nowadays people comprehend a lot better how those processes occur, and are doing sours again on purpose and manipulating those organisms in many ways. Basically, souring bacteria used are &lt;em&gt;pediococcus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; (not very different from &lt;em&gt;lambics&lt;/em&gt;, actually). Most of the time, barrels are still used in the process, because of the micro-aeration those microorganisms need. And, off course, for keeping the microflora inside it, etc, etc, not to mention the flavor complexity that comes from wood compounds itself.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A contaminated beer may end up being a sour. Well, so what distinguish a spoiled beer from a sour? Nothing actually, except that when people intentionally want to produce a sour, they do that with some more control in order to get the outcome they want and not some weird aleatory taste at the end. But, at some level, producing a sour beer, specially when using barrels, is always unpredictable too.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it's a rich and complex topic, probably the most exciting one about brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As suggestions, I definitely encourage you to taste the classic ones, belgian lambics (any &lt;em&gt;Gueuze&lt;/em&gt; you find) and flanders reds (have you ever heard about &lt;em&gt;Rodenbach&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Duchesse de Bourgogne&lt;/em&gt;? they're amazing). I love &lt;em&gt;Petrus Aged Pale&lt;/em&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And, if you are from US, then you are bloody blessed, because american craft brewers are doing sour/wild beers like there were no tomorrow. =P Look for &lt;em&gt;Allagash&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Russian River&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Lost Abbey&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Bruery&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Avery&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Boulevard&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Almanac&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Deschutes&lt;/em&gt;. The list is infinite. The thing is getting so serious that in the last years, all-sour breweries are popping up, like &lt;em&gt;Rare Barrel&lt;/em&gt; from Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is a simple question to ask but has a longer answer with a ton of complexities you probably don't care about if you are not brewing your own.  Ultimately sweet beers are part of the style they are in so avoiding sugary sweet beers is as simple as knowing the styles.  You can skip to the bottom if that's all you want to know.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are two types of sweetness that are often discussed and sometimes confused in beer, a Malty flavor and a Sweet flavor. The same ingredients are involved but in different ways.  Sugary sweet beers basically come from unfermented sugars which simply means sugars that the yeast hasn't processed to create alcohol and carbon dioxide.  This is also called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation_(brewing)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;attenuation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This can be caused by a few different things such as unfermentable sugars that come from the way the beer is mashed (when the grains are mixed in with hot water and left to sit for a specific length of time) or from specialty grains, or the yeast itself.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The explanation of how the mash affects sweetness is very complex and full of biochemistry.  I will try to summarize.  Grains are full of starches that need to be converted to sugar for the yeast to ferment.  There are two main enzymes involved in this process, alpha and beta amylase enzymes.  Using a branched tree analogy works great.  After a strong storm you need to clean up your yard from the limbs that have fallen from the trees.  You have a lopper (alpha amylase) which is great for cutting the branches apart from the limbs but still leave you with long branches and twigs.  You also have a chipper (beta amylase) which is good at taking the branches and twigs and cutting them into little pieces that are easy to use.  The two enzymes need to do their work together to make the most fermentable sugars out of the starches stored in the grains.  Alpha amylase is good at breaking the limbs apart into long starch chains but these are not easy for yeast to ferment.  Beta amylase is great at making small glucose chains that the yeast can convert but the big limbs are too big to get into the chipper, if the alpha amylase doesn't do its job first the beta amylase cant do its job well.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The kicker is each enzyme works in a specific temperature range (beta amylase 131-150°F and alpha amylase 154-162°F).  A brewer can manipulate the mash temperature to ensure both enzymes are working with an overlapping temperature (for instance 152°F) or adjust the temperature up or down to accentuate one enzyme over the other.  For instance if we mashed at 158°F the beta amylase will denature and not affect the beer, while the alpha amylase will be very happy and busy.  This will result in more long starch molecules in the beer which are harder for yeast to ferment and result in a sweeter beer!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Unfermentable sugars can also come from specialty grains added to the beer for flavor and intentional sweetness.  The usual suspects are roasted grains where the sugars inside the grain will start to caramelize such as Dark caramel and roasted malts like Crystal 80, Crystal 120, Special B, Chocolate Malt, and Roast Barley.  Below is a great place for people to start learning the intricacies of brewing beer at home.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.howtobrew.com/section4/chapter20-1.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Increasing the Body&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ultimately these things are done by brewers to make their beer fit into the style they are trying to make along with other things like the amount and type of hops used and other adjuncts (stuff added to beer like fruit or rice or...)  So to avoid sugary beers you mainly need to know what styles are not sweet or its as simple as saying know what types of beers you like.  If you really want to learn the styles turn to the Beer Style Guide!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/catdex.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;2008 BJCP Style Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Look around and see which are sweet and avoid, meanwhile look for highly attenuated beers.  Id expect some you would like are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;German Pilsners&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;American Lagers and Pilsners&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Berliner-Style Weisse&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Dunkel Weizen/Dunkel Weissbier&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Munich Helles&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Belgian-Style Pale Strong Ale&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Pale Ales shouldn't be too sweet&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Kölsch&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;IPAs should be dry&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you want to be adventurous try a Wood- and Barrel-Aged Sour Beer.  They are supposed to be dry although I can't speak from experience.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The heavier beers (ABV 6.5% +) tend to have a sweeter taste as the alcohol increases. Alcohol may add a bit of sweetness to a beer, but it is mostly due to the amount of malt used to increase the alcohol of the beer. Note: Certain styles, like the Belgian Strong Ales, also tend to have sugar added. Sometimes this may lead to a sweeter beer, but the beer (usually) should finish dry.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer that is cloyingly sweet after you finished your sip is usually not well fermented.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the stout style you also get Sweet Stout that is made to be sweeter using lactose (milk sugar) which is unfermentable.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;(Assuming you are referring to "plain" beers, not beers with weird ingredients)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The only allergen that is present in normal beers is malt that contains gluten. Gluten intolerant people can therefor react to beer very aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Next, I would guess the alcohol. Some people have violent reactions to any form of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Then, maybe the bitterness or just the flavour. The people may be sensitive to bitterness, or just really do not like the taste of (that) beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have had beers that taste like baby vomit. It is VERY hard to not gag when you taste that! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You have to determine why the person reacts that way. If it is the malt, then get them a gluten free beer, if it is alcohol, then try an alcohol free beer, or just a cold drink, if it is the bitterness, then get a beer that is less bitter, if it is the flavour, then get a beer with a different flavour (fruit beer or a different style of beer that has other prominent flavours).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a few common allergens in beer- hops are a fairly common allergen, and gluten intolerances or celiac's disease can cause physical illness. Yeast is also a common allergen.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, some people lack the ability to properly process alcohol- this often manifests by a single beer being enough to cause illness and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In general, beer only has 4 ingredients: grain, hops, yeast and water. Of those 4 ingredients, 3 can cause issues with somebody who is sensitive (everything but water). As Tom said, if a person has Celiac's Disease, they're going to be sensitive to the gluten that that is in barley and wheat, which is why some breweries are offering an alternative (usually made with sorghum).  It's also possible that hops might be an issue for somebody sensitive.  I have a friend who is allergic to hops.  There are also folks who are sensitive to yeast. Both ale yeast and baker's yeast are Saccharomyces cerevisiae, so if somebody has trouble with yeast raised bread, they'll have trouble with beer too.  A yeast sensitivity can be mitigated by filtering the beer, but not all of it is captured.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;All that said, I thought that I was going to get sick before I tried a certain maple bacon doughnut beer and surprisingly, I really enjoyed it. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is a condition caused by alcohol, called an "alcohol flush reaction". Some people (often from Asia) have a condition, not related to allergies, that makes them lack a certain enzyme that lets their bodies process alcohol properly. The condition apparently causes rapid intoxication and nausea after drinking only small amounts of alcohol, and I believe the reason for the sufferings are an overproduction of the same waste chemicals that causes the really bad hangovers (aldehydes). Anyhow, I wouldn't blame them for being abstinent.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Corn, rice, sorghum, buckwheat, millet and quinoa are popular. Each has their own special trick to get it to convert the starches to sugars.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In Africa sorghum lagers are very popular, and they have the same shelf life of "normal pale" lagers. aka 3-6 months. I do not know if gluten-free affects the shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is a whole class of drinks called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrub_%28drink%29" rel="nofollow"&gt;Shrubs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Shrubs usually involve a base syrup made from vinegar and fruits and spices and then mixed with a spirit. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Shrub syrups are &lt;a href="http://www.bonappetit.com/drinks/cocktails/article/shrubs-spritzes-swizzles" rel="nofollow"&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt; in a variety of flavors and there are plenty of recipes out there too for creating your own Shrubs at home. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My experience with and what I would define as a example Shrub would involve a shrub syrup, fresh fruit muddled in it with a spirit and then mixed, topped off with crushed ice and soda water. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I seriously doubt it. What happens over time is that chemicals giving the taste decays, and you cannot magically make them appear. You could perhaps add something to give it taste, but then, is it still beer?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Refermenting (could be done by adding sugar) will give carbon dioxide and alcohol, but not more taste.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If it's not a beer with a high alcohol percentage (say 7%+) I'd just throw it out, life's too short to drink stale beer. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Otherwise you can test several bottles. You might get lucky with a few, not every bottle in the same case ages at the same rate, certainly if it's one with fermentation on the bottle. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tip&lt;/strong&gt;: If you hear a hiss when opening the bottle, it's safe to taste. I never trust a bottle that's silent when opening as it almost guarantees that it's gone bad.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Mint extract and mint oil won't do the same thing as leaves, not exactly. The flavor is different. If you infuse it with mint leaves, the flavor can have a more "leafy" or herbal quality, not necessarily a good thing. And infusions can change the color of your liquor, which if you're drinking it straight is not ideal. For these reasons, I'd use extract. It's also cheaper than oil, more shelf stable, and it's less concentrated which makes it easier to adjust how minty your hooch is. Just add it at the end when the kilju is finished and filtered. You can consider using peppermint extract instead of mint, which is usually a combination of peppermint and spearmint. And you might want to add a little simple syrup too.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'll take a stab at this... Absinthe is an unregulated name unlike something like Champagne which is highly regulated name/place. With Champagne you can only use Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay in making it and it has to be grown in the Champagne region. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Absinthe can be made by any distiller anywhere in the world. What that means is that you could put whatever you want into a bottle and call it Absinthe (within liquor regulations). True that traditional Absinthe is a green color, from wormwood, but using other herbs or plants could change it a different color. But a quick look around the web yielded several wildly colored examples called Absinthe. So, if it bugs you, only drink green Absinthe and ignore the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Clear Absinthe&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Absinthe is made much in the same way that many gins are.  You take neutral spirits, add botanicals (wormwood and anise), and re-distill.  Anything that comes out of the still will be clear.  Some absinthes at this point are finished, these will be called blanche (white) or sometime la bleue.  The first absinthe available in Val-de-Travers (the birthplace of absinthe) after the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/04/world/europe/rebirth-of-the-potion-that-made-valdetravers-famous.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;ban in Switzerland was lifted&lt;/a&gt; was a blanche.  That same bottling was the driving force behind making it legal in the United States &lt;a href="http://www.bevlaw.com/absintheinamerica/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;(interview of lawyer who fought the ban)&lt;/a&gt;.  It can be really good stuff.  Any of these can be really easily colored.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Green Absinthe&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Usually absinthe gets a second chance to mingle (macerate) with some herbs after it's sprung from the still, this style is known at verte.  This is when it gets it's color, as well as some extra flavor and aroma. It's a more complex flavor.  The color that the chlorophyll imparts is dull.  If it's neon green there was &lt;a href="http://realabsinthe.blogspot.com/2011/06/what-makes-green-fairy-green.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;food coloring added&lt;/a&gt; and some of these "greener" varieties are actually blanche at heart.  Also of note is that sometimes these food colored types add sugar, to make it friendlier to less experienced drinkers (or to hide poor distillation technique as happens with vodka).  There is at least &lt;a href="https://www.absinthes.com/absinthe-adnams-rouge-p935" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;one non-green bottling&lt;/a&gt; that I know of that is still macerated post distillation, but uses hibiscus which turns it red.  These methods of coloration don't make them any less of a true absinthe, they do use wormwood (and equally important, anise).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Czech Absinth (without the e)&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The most common non-green "absinthe" is so called Czech-style, also known as Bohemian style.  These are &lt;a href="http://wormwoodsociety.org/index.php/general-information-education-214/39-whats-wrong-with-bohemian-qstyleq-absinth" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;not rightly called absinthe&lt;/a&gt; and are historically known for very low quality.  Instead of distilling the botanicals in the alcohol, they are cold compounded.  It's made either by mixing spirits, flavoring oils, and food coloring or by macerating the botanicals without distillation.  Be wary of absinthes &lt;a href="https://www.diffordsguide.com/encyclopedia/275/bws/absinthe-how-is-absinthe-made" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;much over 140 proof&lt;/a&gt;, as they are frequently Czech-style.  Do be aware that they're called Czech-style because that's where the style originated and where most of this variety still comes from, however the Czech Republic does have &lt;a href="http://www.praguepost.com/articles/2006/04/26/worthy-of-their-name.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;good examples of absinthe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think you are misunderstanding what "fruit spirits" are. It is essentially ethanol. Spirits (or ethanol) are derived from something fermenting. This can be sugar, fruit or grain based. Fruit based spirits are things like brandy where wine (from grapes) is distilled down to ethanol. I have a feeling this is grape based spirits. The base isn't all that important since the spirit flavors are pretty neutral.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To make this I would get a very neutral vodka or Everclear (if you can) and start mixing in Elderflower Syrup and some sugar and experiment until you like it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;All I've seen anywhere is that the base is eau-de-vie. Eau-de-vie means different things in different places but, in France (where St. Germain hails from) it basically means any distillate. I'd venture to say, since St. Germain refuses to specify, that it's actually a blend of unaged fruit brandys. If this is the case, it almost certainly includes pear (who's distillate is pretty popular in France).... and if you mix grapes and strawberries (both grown in France) you can come close to something approximating lychee (which I doubt they would ship in). The addition of the elderflower would push the grape/strawberry even closer in that lychee direction. This is all just speculation, a whimsy to kick around over a cocktail. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Realistically, I'd pick up a bottle of high quality syrup (Monin is popular), and use that to replace the liqueur. You want to use less in the cocktail as it's sweeter, but it'll bear the brunt of the work.  You can add a cheap neutral vodka (like Smirnoff) to thin it out if you like. Don't use water to cut it, it'll change the mouthfeel and water down your cocktail. For further experimentation you can use a combination of pear brandy or schnapps (really anything clear and pear flavored) and vodka, I'd start with two parts vodka to one part pear. You'll want to mix the two because otherwise the pear will likely be too strong. Consider garnishing with an orange or lemon twist to replace the citrus in the St Germain. I wouldn't worry too much about the lychee side of things, it seems any options would run pricey. Yeah, your mix will be lacking something but, no matter what you do it won't be quite be the real McCoy.... let us know how it turns out. Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This book "Reise Um Die Erde Durch Nord-Asien und Die Beiden Oceane ..., Part 1, Volume 3 By Adolph Erman", available on &lt;a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BxK__IQzdSgC&amp;amp;pg=PA267&amp;amp;lpg=PA267&amp;amp;dq=Heracleum%20dulce&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=8ayyyG3yir&amp;amp;sig=tFhtrZSWZDITQxCQ5INs6pE_Yec&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGz5KhwbjRAhUF5xoKHfrhAiI4FBDoAQgrMAQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;googleBooks&lt;/a&gt;, which describes a trip to Russia in 1828-30 quotes yet another text "Vergl. Opisanie semli Kamtschatiki Tsch II Str. 199" which in turn has a more detailed description of the Kamchatskan Cossacks making a preparation of H stems with some kind of honeysuckle berries (lonicera cerulea) and warm water, and eventually distilling a spirit from it with possible hallucinogenic properties.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The text is in German, my own German is a little rusty, and the text cannot be copied to put into google translate.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The other text quoted is probably this &lt;a href="http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/exhibition-reading-europe/detail.html?id=99047" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;A Description of Kamchatka Semi-island. V.2, published 1755&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So I think your sources are quoting much older sources for this. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I found another source (1779), &lt;a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=1&amp;amp;itemID=A758.03&amp;amp;viewtype=text" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Captain Cook's account of his own travels in Kamchatka&lt;/a&gt; also speaks of this plant (page 337), and has another explanation of why it was used for making spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I can't find anything recent to suggest that the practice is still current, but who knows ?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Mixing Alcohol is fine, though it's best to use common sense when doing so and not to go too overboard doing so. It worth checking other possibilities as well contributing to the unwellness: Did your friend eat before drinking, what was eaten? As for the rashes, that sounds like some sort of allergic rection.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;By personal experience, Mixed Alcohol effects people differently with me, I can't drink Jager-Bombs or mix two Different wines. But I have many friends that can.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/shared/PDF/SE_Risk_Assess_Oct2005.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;a USDA report&lt;/a&gt;, a study done in 2000 showed that of the estimated 47 billion eggs consumed in the U.S. annually, 2.3 million of them were estimated to be contaminated by salmonella, leading to approximately 240,000 illnesses.  So, if my math is correct, for any given egg, you have something like a 1 in 100,000 chance of getting one that has salmonella, and the chance of getting ill is somewhat less that that...Somewhere between 1 in 100,000 and 1 in a million.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, relatively low risk, I'd say, assuming that the global numbers are at least on the same order of magnitude as what we see in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, there is a way to reduce the risk even further...Nearly to zero.  That is to use pasteurized eggs.  Most shell eggs sold in the U.S. are unpasteurized, but you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; find pasteurized shell eggs, and the pasteurization process does quite a good job of killing salmonella, and so these eggs are highly recommended in any concoction that requires raw, or undercooked eggs.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is highly dependent on where you are located and your risk tolerance (do you eat sushi, rare beef, etc?). As someone who has had salmonellosis, I can verify that you &lt;strong&gt;really, really&lt;/strong&gt; do not want to contract it. Really.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, in the US you are &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; OK, elsewhere likely somewhat less so (relative risk is probably roughly an order of magnitude greater in Western Europe, and likely still greater elsewhere). This is thoroughly set out in Athanasius's &lt;a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/67006"&gt;great answer&lt;/a&gt; on our Cooking sister site.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would not rely on the alcohol content of the fizz to vitiate the risk in a material way: microbicidal potency of alcohol at concentrations below 50% is pretty negligible (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/disinfection_sterilization/6_0disinfection.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)... so if the reason you wouldn't eat an egg raw is the risk of gastroenteritis (and not some ick factor), then I'd consider the risks the same.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The main hazards of mixing alcohol with milk are that you may denature the milk proteins and get curds.  Unpleasant, but probably not likely to provoke an allergic reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Does your friend have any nut or pollen/tree allergies?  Depending on what the whiskey was casked in, there could be some residual allergens that were the actual culprit.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Aquafaba could be something to think about.  Here's a quick overview:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The water that is left after boiling beans or chickpeas is full of proteins and starches etc...  If whisked like egg white it produces what can only be described as meringue.  I believe that you could add your cocktail to this, whisk it all up and there you have it.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can either boil your own beans/chickpeas, or buy a jar/tin, drain (use chickpeas for other things: humus or curry or something) put the water (aquafaba) in a bowl and whisk (it will take a little time so an electric whisk is best).  The guys at aquafaba know more than me about it's uses, here's the &lt;a href="http://aquafaba.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, and they also have a Facebook page.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have not tried making cocktils with aquafaba, but have made meringues from it and it does work.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is no need to cook aquafaba as it is already cooked (no salmonella risk)- it's just a by-product and is suitable for both vegetarians and vegans.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am going to put my two bits into this question also.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are several existing colored absinthe on the market at the moment and a couple of ways to get various colored varieties. Artificial coloring is the most common.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Absinthe may be found in the following colors: &lt;strong&gt;Green, Red (or Rose), Yellow, Brown, Clear and Blue.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One way to get the desired colored is to make your own absinthe as can be seen in the following recipe. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Put the dry herbs in a large jar. Dampen slightly. Add 800 milliliters of 85-95 percent alcohol. Wine spirits make a better product than pure grain alcohol. Let steep for several days - a week is better - shaking occasion absinthe. Then add 600 milliliters of water and let the whole macerate for another day. Decant off the liquid squeezing as much from the mass of herb as possible. Wet the herbs with some vodka and squeeze again. Recipe should give a little over a liter and a half of green liquor. It must then be distilled... - &lt;a href="http://absinthe.msjekyll.com/recipe.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Traditional absinthe recipe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There or other non-traditional herbs and artificial coloring agents that are used to make a particular color also.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Absinthe can be classified differently&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;By color:&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Green absinthe – classically natural color of absinthe. Color can vary from deep emerald to light green or olive shade. Practically every manufacturer produces green absinthe. &lt;strong&gt;But because the natural dye (chlorophyll from the leaves) is not durable therefore manufacturers in most cases use artificial coloring.&lt;/strong&gt; To preserve natural green color of absinthe it is bottle in green or brown bottles. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Yellow absinthe – is usually natural colored because natural dye from chlorophyll has a tendency to lose its color and become more yellowish in couple of months after production (aging of absinthe). &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Red absinthe – is colored by extract of pomegranate or macerated with blossoms of hibiscus what gives absinthe light-ruby shade and original after-taste. But nowadays majority of red absinthes are artificially colored. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Brown absinthe – unlike all the other absinthes this kind is macerated with the roots of wormwood not the leaves of blossoms. Also dark color can be achieved by adding black cutch extract which brings slight flavour of berries. - &lt;a href="http://absinthe-time.eu/EN/menu/kinds-of-absinthe" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Kinds of Absinthe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia has this to say about absinthe:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Absinthe may also be naturally coloured pink or red using rose or hibiscus flowers. This was referred to as a &lt;strong&gt;rose&lt;/strong&gt; (pink) or &lt;strong&gt;rouge&lt;/strong&gt; (red) absinthe. Only one historical brand of rose absinthe has been documented.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Many contemporary absinthe critics simply classify absinthe as distilled or mixed, according to its production method. And while the former is generally considered far superior in quality to the latter, an absinthe's simple claim of being 'distilled' makes no guarantee as to the quality of its base ingredients or the skill of its maker.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blanche&lt;/strong&gt;, or la Bleue: Blanche absinthe (also referred to as la Bleue in Switzerland) is bottled directly following distillation and reduction, and is uncoloured (clear). The name la Bleue was originally a term used for bootleg Swiss absinthe, but has become a popular term for post-ban-style Swiss absinthe in general.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As noted in &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/a/6410/5064"&gt;Montijello's excellent answer&lt;/a&gt;, clear absinthe may be easily artificially colored.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of Clear Absinthes on the market as can be seen on the following website:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.absinthes.com/en/clear-absinthe-s328" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Clear Absinthe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;This is usually the favourite of people trying absinthe for the first time, and of the most experience absintheurs: where absinthe drinkers settle again in the end, having explored the world of green absinthe. Quite simply because it is balanced and delicious. Much of the finest absinthe is clear. Also known as Blanche, La Bleue, and white absinthe...&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;St. Germain is made from liqueur flavored with Elderflower.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As soon as the flowers reach the collection station, they are immediately macerated using a “secret” family technique, which is said to give them the best flavor, while not being too bitter, too sweet or as inconsistent as other methods, such as freeze drying or pressing the flowers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These are then infused into eau-de-vie (Unaged Brandy), although this part of the process is not well elucidated by the company. The spirit is then sweetened lightly, but is said to contain less sugar than a typical liqueur. The liqueur is then bottled.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Since st. germain is made without any preservatives, it is recommended that you use the bottle within 6 months of opening.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are no alcoholic beverages made from the "nectar" of flowers per se. It would be very difficult/expensive to collect 100% flower nectar straight from flowers in sufficient quantities to make a beverage. Having said that, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey" rel="noreferrer"&gt;honey&lt;/a&gt; is essentially flower nectar collected by bees and regurgitated in the hive as a future food source. You can enjoy fermented Honey as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Mead&lt;/a&gt; in a wide variety of flavors and flower varieties. Bees store the nectar in a "honey stomach" so there is no digestion of the nectar. &lt;a href="http://ucanr.edu/blogs/blogcore/postdetail.cfm?postnum=15512" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Read in more detail here:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"Although many sources refer to the honey bee crop as the 'honey
					  stomach,' it is not a place where consumed foods are being digested in
					  honey bees."&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;In their book, Honey Bee Biology and Beekeeping, authors Dewey Caron
					  and Lawrence John "Larry" Connor define the honey stomach as a a
					  "honey sac."&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;It's "an enlargement of the posterior end of the esophagus in the bee
					  abdomen in which the bee carries the nectar from flower to hive."&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Bee vomit? No way. It's where nectar is stored. It's not a stomach as
					  we know it.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, beer is made with a flower called hops. There are many other beers and meads flavored with dried flowers. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for where to buy Mead, you can most likely find it any decent beer/wine/liquor store and easily by searching the web.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can tie of the end of banana's in flower. Come back &amp;amp; drink them for a kind of wine. Natives do. 1 taste was enough for me. Or buy the buds at the market. That are cut of trees so it produces larger banana's. Dandalion can be used to make a wine. Very good. Just stuff the jug full of flowers. Ferment , filter, drink. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any spirits that never should be combined in a cocktail or drink?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The short answer is &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But that said, there are some spirits that some might want to think twice about since they have an overpowering taste. On the top of my list would be absinthe and chartreuse (especially the green). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Absinthe traditionally has a natural green colour but may also be colourless. It is commonly referred to in historical literature as "la fée verte" (the green fairy). Although it is sometimes mistakenly referred to as a liqueur, absinthe is not traditionally bottled with added sugar; it is therefore classified as a spirit. Absinthe is traditionally bottled at a high level of alcohol by volume, but it is normally diluted with water prior to being consumed. - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absinthe" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Absinthe (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Chartreuse has a very strong characteristic taste. It is very sweet, but becomes both spicy and pungent. It is comparable to other herbal liqueurs such as Galliano, Liquore Strega or Kräuterlikör, though it is distinctively more vegetal. Like other liqueurs, its flavour is sensitive to serving temperature. If straight, it can be served very cold, but is often served at room temperature. It is also featured in some cocktails. &lt;strong&gt;Some mixed drink recipes call for only a few drops of Chartreuse due to the assertive flavour.&lt;/strong&gt; It is popular in French ski resorts where it is mixed with hot chocolate and called Green Chaud. - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartreuse_(liqueur)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Chartreuse (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally I drink chartreuse and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9n%C3%A9dictine" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;bénédictine&lt;/a&gt; straight, while I will drink absinthe with water and ice. Absinthe is too overpowering for me to use in a cocktail or mix.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the end, whether or not to use a particular spirit in a cocktail or as a mix is personal choice and there are no fixed rules on the subject, so one must be aware of what a particular spirit might do to your recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whew!&lt;/em&gt; There are a lot of good questions in your question! To get the credentials out of the way, I'm a tea writer that owns a tea tavern and has done quite a bit of homebrewing (I've also made some &lt;a href="https://teawithgary.com/2014/11/25/tea-and-beer/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;tea beer&lt;/a&gt;, which may interest you).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, the only "official" ingredients of beer (if you follow the Reinheitsgebot, or Bavarian Purity Law) are barley, water, hops, and yeast. Similarly, "real" tea is made only from the leaves of the &lt;em&gt;Camellia sinensis&lt;/em&gt; plant, but "herbal" tea consists of pretty much any leaf, stem, root, seed, or flower you want to steep in water.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With that covered, we can move on to common terminology, where beer can contain a variety of different grains, like malted and unmalted barley, wheat, oats, rye, and corn. I've even used more exotic grains like triticale in a homebrew. A lot of adjuncts are often added, too, ranging from honey to berries, juniper buds, and every imaginable spice.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, as to question 1: Yes, you can use beer brewing ingredients for making herbal teas. You'll want to blend them, though. Steeping straight hops doesn't make for a great drink. If you steep the hops for 3-5 minutes in boiling water, most of the aromatic oils will evaporate and most of the bittering agents won't have a chance to take effect. It's pretty meh. Blend hops with tea leaves or other herbs, though, and you can make an interesting drink.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Question 2: Very little of the flavor of a typical beer develops in the keg. It develops during the boil and the primary/secondary fermentation steps. Once it hits the bottle (or keg), beer is ready to drink. You can certainly toss barley in boiling water and let it steep a while to make a drink, but without the fermentation process, it won't taste a whole lot like beer. That doesn't mean it won't be good — especially when blended with herbs — but it won't be beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Question 3: Since you're using water to make both tea and beer, and yeast has no place in tea, you're really asking whether barley or hops makes a better tea. It depends on your personal taste. I'd probably say hops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And Question 4: I'll give you the same recommendation I'd give any homebrewer or tea lover: experiment. Hops are pretty cheap. Buy some (the flowers, not the pellets), get some teas with flavor bases you like, and play around. Malted barley is cheap enough that you can probably talk a homebrewer into giving you a couple of pounds, especially if you trade for a six-pack.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Good luck, and let us know how your experiments turn out!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Why do some wines taste salty?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ed C. Kraus, a 3rd generation home brewer/winemaker and has been an owner of E. C. Kraus since 1999 has 4 possible reasons why a wine may have a salty taste. He has been helping individuals make better wine and beer for over 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;My first thought would be that if you are aging in a wooden barrel, the remnant salts from the sodium metabisulfite may have built up over the years through insufficient rinsing or no rinsing at all. But this is very unlikely. If you make any kind of conscious effort to rinse a barrel you would be able to keep up with the trace amount of salts that are left behind with each wine batch. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;My second thought is that a mistake was made in a dosage added to a wine/must. For instance, yeast nutrient (diammonium phosphate) would add what some would call a salty taste to the wine if too much were added, but this would take many times the normal recommend dosage.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Third would be saltiness from the grapes themselves. This could add a salty taste in wine. This could apply if you made the wine from fresh grapes from a vineyard. The mineral content of the soil is always reflected in the grape’s flavor to some degree. This is one of the reasons a grape’s origin is always noted. If you are making wine for the first time from a particular soil or terroir, then this is what could be going on.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The fourth thing that comes to mind is a mold infection. The only reason I left this for last is because it is the least likely of the four. This is because by the time the wine has a salty taste from mold, it is already blatantly obvious from a visual inspection that mold as set in. So if you don’t see any patches of dried crust on the surface anywhere, or a rainbow-ed, oil-slick look on the wine’s surface, the salty taste in the wine is not being caused by a mold.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Beyond these things the only thing that comes to mind is accidentally putting salt in the wine. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes, wine can pretty much be made from all edible fruit, &lt;a href="http://edibleroadtrip.com/blog/2014/1/2/6tjqenl9lxr9h0vyk54aob7hms68f0" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;including tomatoes&lt;/a&gt;. But the reason we make wine out of grapes is three fold. Sugar, tannins and acids. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sugar&lt;/strong&gt;. Grapes produce the highest naturally occurring amount of sugar of any fruit. Almost no other fruit comes close. Grapes have the ability to make wines that are anywhere from 10-18% alcohol and even higher in the case of late harvest grapes that have too much sugar to finish alcohol production. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acid&lt;/strong&gt;. Grapes have a very high naturally occurring acid levels coming from Tartaric acid. Acids help preserve wine and keep the nasty bugs from eating the sugar. They also make it more drinkable. Wine without any acid is flat and awful. It's like beer without hops.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tannin&lt;/strong&gt;. Red and white grapes contain tannin in both the skins and seeds. These are a natural antioxidant that help preserve the wine for long term storage. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Since grapes have such natural high sugar levels, they also have large colonies of yeast on the skin (aka the bloom) and because of this, grapes are a complete package requiring nothing else to make a high alcohol beverage that can be stored for a very long time without spoiling. No other fruit has the right combination of attributes to do this on it's own.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If they can make wine out of durian fruit, then one can make wine out of any fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most people find the taste or flavor of this fruit disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In fact durians are not allowed on the Singapore subway or on many commercial flights at all.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/78FeG.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/78FeG.jpg" alt="Sign informing that Durian fruit is not allowed inside the Singapore subway"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durian" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Sign informing that Durian fruit is not allowed inside the Singapore subway.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yet durians can be made into wine and what is great about it, is the fact that the durian wine is devoid of its' pungent smell.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;It's a formidable feat pulled off by a team of student researchers at the National University of Singapore who hope to commercialize their durian wine and see the product on store shelves.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Known as both the "King of Fruits" and the world's stinkiest fruit, the durian is likewise perhaps the most polarizing food with people who either love it hate it.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;After testing out different fermentation methods, the end result is a &lt;strong&gt;wine of 6 percent alcohol which is devoid of the fruit's pungent smell.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/eats/world-stinkiest-fruit-turned-wine-article-1.1411504" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;World's stinkiest fruit is turned into wine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the others, I'll say &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt;, at least if you're going to have some reasonable definition of the word "wine". Fruits which will produce no fermentable juices are simply not going to work. If you have to treat the fruits in such a way as to convert starches in order to get sugars to ferment, can you really call the product a "wine", even in a loose sense?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You are going to struggle mightily to produce wine from avocados or eggplants, for example... even limes are so low in sugar and high in acidity that even after neutralizing some acid you will have to add a bunch of sugar to have anything to ferment... in this case, you're really making a flavored kilju, rather than a wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And if you want to get technical about fruits, then "all fruits" is actually a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit#Simple_fruit" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;very broad category&lt;/a&gt;. Brazil nuts, &lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Acer_circinatum_26294.JPG" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;maple keys&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Carrot_seeds_in_Uzbekistan.JPG" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;carrot seeds&lt;/a&gt; are all fully-fledged fruits that are going to be very difficult or impossible to extract a fermentable juice from.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Of course, you could probably use a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_oryzae" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;koji&lt;/a&gt; to first saccharify your initial base and produce something like a sake, but despite the colloquial misnomer "rice wine", if you're going to call this a wine, then you can do it with nearly anything: why limit yourself to fruits? Then is there really a further difference with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kvass" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;kvass&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumis" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;kumis&lt;/a&gt;. Is beer now wine?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is completely discounting the whole classes of toxic fruits that you might be able to produce something technically alcoholic but definitely nondrinkable from, e.g. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atropa_belladonna" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;belladonna&lt;/a&gt; and other toxic nightshades, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actaea_pachypoda" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;baneberries&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;An acquaintance of mine who did time claimed he used &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Alive" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Five Alive&lt;/a&gt; to make &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;jail brew&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. But then what can you believe from inmates! Prison brew generally does not taste all that great.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is one way to make &lt;strong&gt;Jailhouse Brew&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Pruno is a type of easy homemade fruit wine that’s often made by inmates in prison. Because pruno is typically made with makeshift ingredients, it doesn’t always taste very good. Making pruno is quite simple, but some recipes create the perfect environment for Clostridium botulinum. This is a bacterium that causes botulism, a form of food poisoning that can be fatal. Because of this, you must be very careful when you're making this homemade wine.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artisan Pruno&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ul&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;10 oranges, peeled and roughly chopped&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;10 apples, roughly chopped&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 cup (225 g) plus one tablespoon (14 g) sugar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2¼ teaspoons (one 7-gram package) yeast&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;3 cups (711 ml) water&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 cup (227 g) fruit cocktail&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1½ ounces (43 g) raisins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimalist Pruno&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ul&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;10 oranges, peeled&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 cup (227 grams) fruit cocktail&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 cups (474 ml) water&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;6 teaspoons (30 g) ketchup&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making Artisan Pruno&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Avmwn.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Avmwn.jpg" alt="Method 1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;1 &lt;strong&gt;Gather your supplies&lt;/strong&gt;. Traditional pruno made by inmates is made with few supplies and the ingredients that are available in prison. But at home, you can also make your own version of pruno using all the convenient equipment and ingredients available in a modern kitchen. To make artisan pruno at home, you'll need: &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Immersion blender&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Wooden spoon&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Large saucepan&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Small bowl&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•One-gallon (3.8-L) sealable plastic bag&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Clean bath towel&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Heating pad&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Strainer&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Cheesecloth&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Large bowl&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Funnel&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Large sterile bottle or jar with lid&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;2 &lt;strong&gt;Puree the fruit&lt;/strong&gt;. Combine the apple and orange chunks, plus the fruit cocktail and raisins, in a large saucepan. Use the immersion blender to puree the fruit until it’s juicy and pulpy, but still has some bite-sized chunks in it. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Make sure to move the immersion blender around in the bowl as you blend, to ensure the fruit is pureed evenly.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;3 Boil the fruit, sugar, and water. When the fruit is ready, add the 1 cup (225 g) of sugar and 2 cups (474 ml) of the water and stir to combine. Put on the lid, transfer the fruit mixture to the stove, and bring it to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently to prevent burning. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Once the fruit comes to a boil, let it simmer for 30 minutes to kill any bacteria that may be present. Continue stirring the mixture regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;4 &lt;strong&gt;Cool the fruit&lt;/strong&gt;. After the fruit boils for 30 minutes, remove it from the heat and let it cool. You don’t want it completely cold, but slightly above room temperature to help the yeast flourish. As the fruit cools, continue stirring from time to time so it cools evenly.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•The cooling process will take about 30 minutes to an hour&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;5 &lt;strong&gt;Activate the yeast&lt;/strong&gt;. Combine the yeast, the 1 cup of warm water, and the 3 teaspoons of sugar in a bowl. Set the bowl aside for five to 10 minutes to let it activate.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•As the yeast comes to life, it will begin to froth and bubble in the bowl.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;6 &lt;strong&gt;Add the yeast and transfer the mixture to the bag&lt;/strong&gt;. Pour the yeast mixture over the fruit and stir to fully combine. Transfer the mixture to the plastic bag. Press out as much air as you can, then seal the bag.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•It’s important to warm the fruit mixture because the yeast will die if it gets too cold.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;7 &lt;strong&gt;Store the mixture somewhere warm and dark&lt;/strong&gt;. Wrap the fruit mixture in a clean bath towel to help keep in the heat. Then place the towel on top of an electric heating pad turned to low temperature. Transfer the fruit, towel, and heating pad to a dark place, such as a closet. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•If you don’t have an electric heating pad, fill a hot water bottle with warm water. Be sure to check on the water ever six to 12 hours, and add fresh warm water as necessary when the bottle starts to get cold.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•The reason you have to keep the fruit mixture warm is so the yeast will stay alive to ferment the fruit and turn it to alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;8 &lt;strong&gt;Burp the bag daily&lt;/strong&gt;. As the yeast converts the sugars in the bag to alcohol and carbon dioxide, the bag will slowly fill up with gas. To prevent it from bursting, remove the bag from the towel once or twice a day and open the bag to release the gas and pressure. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Reseal the bag, wrap it back in the towel, and return it to its dark spot on the heating pad.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•When the mixture stops bloating, it means the yeast has converted all the sugar to alcohol and carbon dioxide, meaning the pruno is ready. This will take about five days.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;9 &lt;strong&gt;Strain the pruno&lt;/strong&gt;. When the mixture has stopped bloating, it’s ready to strain. Place a cheesecloth-lined strainer over a bowl. Pour the fruit mixture into the strainer and let the juice drain down into the bowl.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•To get the most juice out, wring out the cheesecloth with the fruit still inside&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;10 &lt;strong&gt;Transfer to a bottle and chill before serving&lt;/strong&gt;. Place the funnel inside the neck of a sterile glass jar or bottle. Pour the pruno into the bottle. Transfer the bottle to the fridge and allow it to chill for several hours or overnight. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•A large mason jar will work to store your pruno, or a large two-liter pop bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Any fruit juice that will ferment. Apple, grape, orange, peach or whatever sugary concoction you can get your hands on. Raisins are especially good. Prunes. Tomatoes. Fruit Cocktail. Packets of sugar. Maple syrup. Even bread that has been turned into mush will ferment again. The hard part is fermenting it without being caught. Any plastic bucket will do. Ziploc bags. Even the toilet in your cell is good enough. Don't worry about yeast. If you can get a piece of fresh fruit like an apple it will have enough yeast to do the dirty work. Then just like our ancient ancestors, drink it when it's done fermenting. Who cares if it's cloudy or full of chunks, you have one goal and that's to get a buzz...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Friends of mine worked for Aramco in Saudi Arabia. Of course there was not alcohol allowed, but the Americans lived in a separate community and the Saudi police turned a blind eye as long as they didn't catch you drunk in public. People got very creative about brewing up stuff from the grocery store. Apple juice and grape juice were easy to get. Baker's yeast and a large bucket and voila, you had apple cider. Then stick it in the freezer until frozen solid and then drain out the alcohol, then you have something about 30% alcohol. Yum!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I was surprised at how tough it was to track down anything that clearly mentioned both.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Firstly, from several recipes, &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/20216/simple-syrup/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;including this one&lt;/a&gt;, it seems that simple syrup is made, as you might expect, by dissolving sugar into an equal amount of water and then cooling.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When it comes to invert sugar, &lt;a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Invert-Sugar" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;recipes&lt;/a&gt; seem to call for more sugar and possibly an acid, be it cream of tartar or acidic acid (sometimes via lemon juice) to help catalyze the inversion of the sugar.  On top of that, they often call for boiling until a temperature of 236 °F (114 °C).  This process effectively breaks downs the bond between the glucose and fructose molecules that make up the sucrose.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cocktailjen.blogspot.com/2007/04/not-so-simple-syrup.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;This page&lt;/a&gt; explains that water activity (correlated with spoilage) is better minimized by monosaccharides, while simple syrup generally only contains sucrose, a disaccharide.  It then goes on to describe a method for making "partially inverted sugar syrup" and calls either for acid or more sugar, as well as boiling for 20 minutes.  Since this process is less exact and does less to force the system to break down the sucrose it's easy to see why it's "partially" inverting the sugar.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So to directly answer your questions, these are different things with simple syrup effectively just being sugar (sucrose) dissolved in water and invert sugar/syrup being dissolved sugar that has been processed to break down into it's component sugars (glucose and fructose).  Invert sugar should be slightly sweeter, thicker, and have a longer shelf-life.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A local brewer that makes some of the best beer I've had told me to try using Pilsner for my base instead of 2 row to help with the queezy feelings I get in my IPA's and Wheats. I just finished a 5 gallon brew so I'll let you know in a week or two how it sits with me. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Is it all beer all the time? If other alcohol is ok then it could be gluten as stated above. If it’s only some beers- it could be a fault in the beer (Eg beers in clear and green bottles) will “skunk” which happens when UB light breaks down some of the hop residue. Try to isolate type and style of beer. Dry hopped beer creates an adverse reaction with me as the hop oils are not broken down in the boiling process.  Stay thirsty my friend&lt;/p&gt;
