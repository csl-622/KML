					&lt;p&gt;What are some of the possible iconic champagnes from each decade of the last 100 years?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Before going on, I would like to define the word &lt;strong&gt;iconic&lt;/strong&gt; which I would like to use as a loose model in the following list of iconic champagnes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Iconic&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Similar to "classic," iconic is generally restricted to more recent, highly original, influential, or unique, works of art, artists, or performers. As such they are now well-established and widely celebrated in popular culture.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;"Oedipus Rex" is a classic, but the original "Planet of the Apes" is truly iconic. - &lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=iconic" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Urban Dictionary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Relating to or characteristic of a famous person or thing that represents something of importance: &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Scenes of Parisians dancing in the streets remain iconic images from World War II. - &lt;a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/iconic" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Cambridge Dictionary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;strong&gt;1920s&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dom_P%C3%A9rignon" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Dom Pérignon&lt;/a&gt; logo champagnes&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vivino.com/wineries/dom-perignon/wines/mot-and-chandon-champagne-cuve-dom-1982" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Dom Pérignon  Brut Champagne 1982&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For this decade I would like to propose any French champagne that puts &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dom_P%C3%A9rignon" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Dom Pérignon&lt;/a&gt; into the spotlight on the label. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://champagnemoments.eu/champagne-history/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Champagne Region&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Sources estimate that approximately 300 million bottles of champagne were sold in the year of 2015. All this champagne is made from grapes grown in a distinctive part of France, the Champagne region. This region of small 34.000 hectares received the sole right to the champagne brand once the law of 1927 was passed. The &lt;strong&gt;law of 1927&lt;/strong&gt; defined the champagne production zone and defined restrictions when making champagne. The champagne production is located just 150 kilometers east of Paris and is divided into four geographical areas.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ul&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Marne (66% of planted area)&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Aube (23%)&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Aisne (10%)&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Haute-Marne and Seine-et-Marne.&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Together these areas form the Champagne region. The reason why the champagne region has been declared the only place in the world to make champagne, is due to the geographical location concerning the latitude and the changing climate, being both influenced by the continental climate as well as the oceanic climate. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;strong&gt;1930s&lt;/strong&gt;: Pol Roger &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/04/01/472459579/hitler-couldnt-defeat-churchill-but-champagne-nearly-did" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Hitler Couldn't Defeat Churchill, But Champagne Nearly Did&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;During the 1930s, as Adolf Hitler was rising to power in Germany, the man who would turn out to be his most implacable foe was drowning — in debt and champagne.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;In 1936, Winston Churchill owed his wine merchant the equivalent of $75,000 in today's money. He was also in hock to his shirt-maker, watchmaker and printer — but his sybaritic lifestyle, of a cigar-smoking, horse-owning country aristocrat, continued apace.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;To get an idea of Churchill's annual alcohol consumption, here's what he ordered in 1908, the year he married Clementine:&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Nine-dozen bottles and seven-dozen half-bottles of Pol Roger 1895 vintage champagne, plus four-dozen half-bottles of the 1900 Pol Roger vintage.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Churchill drank several brands of champagne such as Giesler, Moet et Chandon, and Pommery, but &lt;strong&gt;Pol Roger&lt;/strong&gt; was his clear favorite. Every year on Churchill's birthday, the charming and shrewd Odette Pol Roger sent him a case of champagne. (His other great friend, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, sent him caviar — until they fell out over Churchill's Iron Curtain speech.)&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zbmqo.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zbmqo.jpg" alt="No More Champagne"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;strong&gt;1940s&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.lvmh.com/houses/wines-spirits/moet-chandon/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Moët&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://farandwise.com/champagne/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Occupation Begins, Summer 1940&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;In the first weeks of the occupation, more than 2 million bottles of wine were stolen by Germans. It was comparable to full scale looting of the sort seen after natural disasters and coups, but in this case it involved some of the most storied vineyards in the world and Moët suffered more than most.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;“The Chandon château on the grounds of Dom Pérignon’s abbey had been burned down and many other buildings  belonging to Moët were taken over to house German troops. To add insult to injury, the company had also been ordered to supply the Third Reich with 50,000 bottles of champagne a week, or about one-tenth of all the champagne the Germans were requisitioning.”&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;strong&gt;1950s&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-10-best-selling-champagne-brands-in-the-world-2017-10#8-piper-heidsieck-3" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Piper-Heidsieck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The champagne brand of choice for Marilyn Monroe, Marie Antoinette and all the stars at the Oscars, Piper-Heidsieck champagne is one of the most iconic luxury brands and a favourite among fashion and luxury lifestyle brands. So no wonder it's still doing rather well today - after all, how many brands can say that Marie Antoinette was their first brand ambassador? &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And there is more:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;In a similarly extravagant vein, Marilyn Monroe was reputed to have taken a bath in 350 bottles of Champagne. - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne_glass#Champagne_coupe" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Champagne glass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is even a &lt;a href="http://wine-tasting-reviews.com/winefoodpairing/wine-cocktails-recipes/208-marilyn-monroe-champagne-cocktail-recipe.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Marilyn Monroe Champagne Cocktail Recipe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q3Br5.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q3Br5.png" alt="Champagne sips and chips"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"Hey, did you ever try dunking a potato chip in Champagne. It's real crazy!" 
					  Marilyn Monroe in The Seven Year Itch (1955) - &lt;a href="http://www.champagnejournal.com/blog/files/even_marilyn_loved_champagne_and_chips.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Champagne sips and chips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;strong&gt;1960s&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.darabanth.com/en/major-auction/25/categories~Art-and-collectibles/Vintage-wines~9915/cca-1960-70-GH-Mumm-Extra-Dry-Champagne-Reims-France--0-75l~II1380805/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Mumm&lt;/a&gt;: For the Coupe!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Going to put the Mumm champagne for this decade. Some may say something else, but I like the Mumm champage in coupe glasses.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The Sixties and Seventies saw sales increase in spectacular fashion: shipments rose from three million to six million bottles, making G.H.MUMM the number one Reims Champagne. - &lt;a href="https://www.glassofbubbly.com/g-h-mumm-the-history/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;G.H.Mumm – The History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What about the Mumm champagne in coupe glasses?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;No matter who inspired the coupe glass, it's safe to say its infamy keeps it popular to this day. Especially in the 1930s prohibition-era and in the 1960s, the coupe glass reigned as the choice for sparkling wine even if its design wasn't ideal. With TV shows like "Mad Men" and "Boardwalk Empire," old-fashioned drinks and drinking glasses have been making a comeback. Just stop by any trendy bar in New York City (or any other metropolis) and you'll find cocktails served in the coupe glass. - &lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/marie-antoinette-champagne-coupe_n_1424686" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Glass Shaped Like Marie Antoinette's Anatomy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In 1914, Kate Moss also had a champagne glass modeled after her left breast while pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;To celebrate Kate Moss 25 years in the fashion industry, a champagne glass moulded from her left breast has been created.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Forty-year-old Moss has teamed up with a sculptor and a London restaurant to create the unique champagne glass in her honour.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7BhQp.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7BhQp.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Mayfair’s 34 Restaurant, where Moss celebrated her star-studded 40 birthday lunch back in January, commissioned British artist Jane McAdam Freud, daughter of late painter Lucien Freud who Moss posed for while pregnant, to create a mould of the model’s breast. - &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/news/would-you-drink-from-a-champagne-glass-modelled-on-kate-moss-left-breast-9683113.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;London Restaurant 34 creates champagne glass modeled on Kate Moss' left breast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Mumm’s French Champagne (1968)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;strong&gt;1970s&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/bollinger-the-champagne-that-james-bond-drinks/A0CDEC9F-5B0B-42D0-B83B-E227F4D6472D.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Bollinger&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Bollinger champagnes have appeared in 14 James Bond films, dating back to 1973's "Live and Let Die."&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;strong&gt;1980s&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.catawiki.com/stories/3971-james-bond-the-royal-wedding-other-famous-figures-who-enjoy-dom-perignon-champagne" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Dom Perignon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Dom Pérignon was served at the royal wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana in 1981. A special insignia just for this event was put on the bottles of the 1961 vintage that was served.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;strong&gt;1990s&lt;/strong&gt;: Crystal&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Since the late 1990s, high-end champagne brands have been featured in rap and hip hop music and videos; bottles featured in videos are often quite blingy and distinctive, often gold. The Louis Roederer brand &lt;strong&gt;Cristal&lt;/strong&gt;, with a gold label, has seen increased popularity since the mid-to-late 1990s due to its association with rap and hip hop artists, notably the New York rappers Biggie Smalls (the Notorious B.I.G.), Puff Daddy, and Jay-Z. This high-end image has been cultivated and managed by Cristal's US importer, Maisons Marques. Since 2006, Cristal has seen a loss of popularity and some boycotts, notably by Jay-Z, due to statements perceived as racist, with other champagnes such as Armand de Brignac (gold bottle) making inroads. - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne_in_popular_culture" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Champagne in popular culture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;strong&gt;2000s&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://tastingbook.com/pro/champagne_of_the_decade" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Dom Pérignon and Dom Pérignon Rosé&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;No New Year's Eve would be complete without welcoming the new year (and bidding an enthusiastic farewell to the prior year) with a bottle of bubbly. It's the stuff of celebrations and special occasions, and it's such a big part of holiday traditions around the world that about 25 percent of all champagne is sold in the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve. Just what is it that makes champagne the perfect New Year's drink? You might be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Champagne became the drink of choice at a huge number of landmark celebrations, from royal weddings to the scaling of some of the world's toughest mountains. It then also became linked with New Year's celebrations, which started first with Julius Caesar. It wasn't until the 1800s that staying up for a midnight party became a common tradition, and we know champagne was a major part of it from at least mid-century.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;January 1st, 2000 ushered in the &lt;strong&gt;New Millennium&lt;/strong&gt; and drinking champagne is such an iconic symbol for celebrating this event or any other celebration or party as Dom Pérignon  and Dom Pérignon Rosé should be a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Dom Pérignon’s vintage-only champagne has earned unquestionable prestige and iconic status for its ability to evolve while “resting on the lees”—this lets the champagne develop better textures and flavours, so the next batch of the same vintage is even more intense. These privileged points in time have been dubbed “plenitudes”, and in the case of its P2 2000—the second plenitude of its vintage 2000—can take as long as 16 years to show.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Geoffroy mentions that the wine he is working on now will only be released in around 10 years, and the second plenitude, 15 to 20 years after that. Hence, he reminds us that ripeness is key to a good vintage. In fact, the extreme ripeness of the vintage 2003 harvest, which he describes as “insane and out of balance”, was too much for many but not Dom Pérignon, which saw opportunity in the challenge and eventually declared it a vintage year. “It was the mother of all hot vintages,” he exclaims. - &lt;a href="https://sg.asiatatler.com/dining/bubbly-by-nature" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;We Taste Dom Pérignon’s P2 2000 Champagne In Beijing With Alain Ducasse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c1hdk.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c1hdk.png" alt="Dom Perignon 2004"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The 2004 vintage of Dom Perignon is worth the treat and is a Champagne apart from the rest with notes of marzipan and dry cocoa powder and racy minerality. The toasty finish on the palate is pleasantly unexpected. It is a really well-rounded Champagne with even darker notes on the finish with a kick of spice. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;There’s no better way to ring in the New Year, than with a glass of Dom Preignon. - &lt;a href="https://learn.winecoolerdirect.com/champagne-for-new-years-eve/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Dom Perignon 2004&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;strong&gt;2010s&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.visitaland.com/en/articles/champange/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Juglar, Veuve Clicquot and Heidsieck Champagnes&lt;/a&gt; (until this decade is over)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The decade is not over, so let us wait a few years to truly answer this one.&lt;/strong&gt; In the meantime I place these three champagnes temporarily as an honorary iconic examples of a champagne that is well made and bottled as preservation in obscure and precarious situations shows!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2010 five bottles of beer were discovered in a shipwreck in Föglö in Åland’s outer archipelago. The wreck contained 145 bottles of champagne and five bottles of beer from the 1840s.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Owing to the constant temperature between four and six degrees, the dark surroundings, the pressure inside the bottles and the pressure at the bottom of the sea, the champagne was in extremely good condition. Each bottle was uncorked, tasted and classified by international expert Richard Juhlin.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Out of the bottles that were salvaged, 95 were from the Juglar champagne house, which closed down in 1829. The same owners produce Jacquesson today. Veuve Clicquot was represented by 46 bottles and Heidsieck &amp;amp; Co by four. The Veuve Clicquot bottles were dated 1841–1850. - &lt;a href="http://www.visitaland.com/en/articles/champange/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The oldest champagne found at the bottom of the sea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This really depends on the drink itself. Some wines are meant to keep for years. Others should be drunk immediately. Most should be drunk within 1 or 2 years. So choose your wine carefully. There are various vintage wine guides online.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, once you have chosen a wine meant for ageing, you do want a cellar (or if that is not available, a refrigerator designed for the purpose) that will be able to give you consistent:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Temperature: around 12-13 C (55 F)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Humidity: around 70 percent&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Light: keep wines out of sunlight or even bright lights&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And if the bottles have cork stoppers, they need to be stored on their side to prevent the cork drying out. This isn't an issue with screw tops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And that's pretty much it. If you don't have a cooler or cellar, keeping them in a cool, dark cupboard is still going to help...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I did a deep dive into Stack Exchange because I thought this question would've been asked before! But, it has not. That doesn't mean that the answer isn't super easy to find. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First of all, not all wines are meant to be aged. The vast majority of wines are meant to consume when you pick them up at the store. How can you tell which are which? Mainly on price (although not always the case). As the price point goes higher, these wines have been made with aging in mind and many times are unpalatable at a younger age. Red wines are meant to age longer because the tannins (the thing that gives red wine it's color) are an anti-oxidant. Some white wines like Riesling can age for decades. Champagnes can age for a long time, but because of their delicate nature and the cork and the whole CO2 pressure thing, they are harder to age. I've had some nicely aged Champagnes. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So basically, keep it in the dark and as close to freezing as possible. Some say that 55F is the best temperature, but actually the closer to freezing you get makes it keep longer. The problem is that for bottles with corks you should have a relatively high humidity so the corks don't dry out. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The myth that wines with screw caps don't age has been debunked by the Australian wine industry because the have mostly moved to screw caps and the wines age just fine if differently than bottles with corks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging_of_wine" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Aging of Wine&lt;/a&gt; from Wikipedia pretty much tells you the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes, pretty much any old wine, if it hasn't already turned into vinegar, can be made into vinegar. The best is to start with clean wine, but if it already tastes kind of funky just push it towards the final goal of becoming vinegar. You can let this happen naturally, or you can buy &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_of_vinegar" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;vinegar "mother"&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I will try to answer your questions to the best of my ability.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your description of your earlier wine makes me question you: 
					Have you used a hydrometer to calculate the alcohol percentage of your earlier wines? &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If your wine tasted sweet after fermentation, it means your wine wasn't finished fermenting. If you bottle the wine and let it stay in room temperature with unfermented wine, then you may create bottle bombs.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparison between wild yeast and adding wine yeast:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration of Fermentation:&lt;/strong&gt; Naturally occurring wild yeast will use longer time than wine yeast. Adding Wine yeast is a lot faster, and will substantially reduce the fermentation time.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taste:&lt;/strong&gt; The taste is subjective, where wine yeast may create a safer and cleaner taste, meanwhile wild yeast and other bacteria may produce 'unwanted flavors' or 'wanted flavors'. Everything depends on what you want. I don't know enough about the specific tastes to tell you here.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol percentage:&lt;/strong&gt; I recommend using a hydrometer before and after fermentation to calculate the alcohol percentage of your wine. Adding wine yeast will eat up all the sugar in your wine very fast. 1-2 weeks, while wild yeast may use several months. Everything depends on how much yeast is present in the fermentation, temperature and how much sugar is in the unfermented wine.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wild yeast takes time to grow into a culture which can eat up all the sugar, where wine yeast usually already has ~1 billion cells in the package. &lt;/p&gt;
