					&lt;p&gt;There are many points of comparison, as the &lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/stylecenter.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;beer judging style guidelines&lt;/a&gt; will point out.  Among those characteristics are ABV, IBU (International Bitterness Units), color, aroma, mouthfeel, and of course, &lt;em&gt;flavor&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/stylecenter.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;The BJCP Style Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; specify a wide variety of variables.  These include:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Aroma (malt, hops, yeast, diacetyl, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Appearance (color, clarity, head, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Flavor (sweetness, bitterness, dryness, alcohol, carbonation acidity, diacetyl, fruitiness, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Mouthfeel (body, carbonation, smoothness, astringency, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Ingredients (yeast, mash bill, hops, added ingredients, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These guidelines are from the Beer Judge Certification Program, so they are by necessity based on idealized judging, rather than the intent to taxonomize all of known beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The first four are subjective, coming from the standpoint of categorizing based on the drinking experience.  The last, &lt;em&gt;Ingredients&lt;/em&gt;, is objective and is used for quite a bit of general categorization (ale vs lager yeasts, for example).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You could also argue that the source of many of the subjective factors is variation in the brewing process, such as fermentation temperature, addition or subtraction of various steps, etc.  However if you come at it from the angle of "how do I categorize an unknown beer?", then the first four subjective items are key.  Some of the question is whether you focus on &lt;em&gt;what it is&lt;/em&gt; or on &lt;em&gt;how it got that way&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One very important criterion that @phoebus briefly mentioned is brewing process. The first big distinction is ales versus lagers. Lagers are stored in cold rooms during the production process, and I find they're lighter on average than ales, certainly in terms of flavour, and often in terms of colour as well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;After that, there are lots of less-black-and-white brewing differences between styles of beer. For example, IPAs generally have a considerable amount of hops added, but that's not always true. Hefeweizen has considerable amounts of yeast left after brewing, giving it its cloudy appearance. The list goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think that the traditional names for beer styles (stout, lager, IPA, wheat beer, etc.) are based a lot on brewing process, and in the case of something like lager or wheat beer, the name clearly shows the brewing origin. However, more and more brewers are pushing the boundaries of these styles, so when it comes to things like appearance and flavour, which are ultimately the things that matter, two beers from different brewing styles can be quite similar, or two beers from the same brewing style can be quite different.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is a broad question, notably regarding the differences between IPAs and Double IPAs, but here's an overview focusing on the naming (and misconceptions thereof) and brewing of variants.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h3&gt;Double IPA vs. Imperial IPA (IIPA)&lt;/h3&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, the Double IPA is also known as an Imperial IPA (IIPA). You can think of the "double" as referring to the two letter I's :-) but the name actually owes itself to the beer having "double" the strength / hops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h3&gt;IPA vs. Double IPA&lt;/h3&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Double IPA generally uses more hops (though not literally "double"), lengthier brewing processes (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; Dogfish Head's 90 Minute IPA, which is boiled for longer than its 60 Minute variant), sometimes secondary fermentation, etc. It has higher alcohol content, IPAs stopping around 7.5% ABV, while Double IPAs can soar to above 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Double IPAs are claimed to have been started by the owner of the Russian River Brewing Company, famed for its flagship brew, Pliny the Elder, a Double IPA itself.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h3&gt;American Pale Ale (APA) vs. American IPA&lt;/h3&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The APA and American IPA are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; synonymous. American Pale Ales are a derivative of (regular) British Pale Ales, deriving their own flavor from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hop_varieties#American"&gt;American hops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale. American IPAs, meanwhile, are, of course, derived from actual (British) IPAs, and possess greater bitterness and higher alcohol content—examples include Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale and Dogfish Head's 60 Minute IPA. The line between APAs and IPAs blur (as do between many variants of ales), but categorically speaking, APAs are not IPAs.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h3&gt;IPA vs. Black IPA&lt;/h3&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The black IPA (also known by American Black Ale—and yes, a subset of the American IPA) uses dark roasted malts (used in porters and stouts) to achieve the color, while preserving hops characteristics. Some consider the black IPA more of a hoppy porter instead—and don't believe the style will be formally recognized (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; by the Brewers Association).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sort of.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hop_varieties" rel="nofollow"&gt;literally dozens of different varieties of hops,&lt;/a&gt; in much the same way there are dozens of different breeds of dogs. Just as a Chihuaua and a Great Dane are both &lt;em&gt;Canis Lupus&lt;/em&gt;, a Galena Hop and a Goldings Hop are bot &lt;em&gt;Humulus Lupulus&lt;/em&gt;, separated by vastly different lineages and genetics. New hop varieties are often developed by selective crossbreeding of existing variants, to generate different flavor profiles by adjusting the acidity and oil content of the hop.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Like different breeds of dogs, different hop varieties are often the products of hundreds of years of genetic development in a particular climate -  the Pacific Northwest, especially the Yakima Valley and Cascade Mountains in Washington, Oregon and Idaho, is known for it's production of very strong, highly acidic hops that impart a very strong bitter flavor - take a sip of a Sierra Nevada IPA and you'll instantly recognize that classic blend of the 'three C's'.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;By contrast, traditional hops grown in England and on the European continent tend to be more mellow and aromatic - especially the so called 'noble hops' popular in many less bitter tasting German and Czech beers. Still others, like Japans Sorachi Ace, offer a more citrus bite to the beer they're added to. While these differences are not &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; a product of climate, it's doubtless true that climate has had an impact on the development of variation amongst the various hop lines that have been bred through the centuries -  and especially over the past 50 years or so.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Put another way: New World vs. Old World Hops is a meaningful distinction, but it has less to do with climate and more to do with the difference in cultivation practices and the specific varietals popular with farmers in various regions. Growing conditions may have some impact, but the specific lineage matters &lt;em&gt;much, much more&lt;/em&gt;. The fact that those lineages tend to have significant geographic commonalities is as much an accident of history as it is of varying conditions, but it's nonetheless sufficiently meaningful that, in particular referring to hops from the Pacific Northwest evokes a very specific and comprehensible flavor profile in most educated beer drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Doppelbock (or double bock) is intense in its maltiness and higher than "single" bock in terms of alcohol content, typically starting around 6-7% and going up to around 13%.  There isn't anything specifically doubled or tripled; rather, &lt;em&gt;doppel&lt;/em&gt; idiomatically refers to be being "bigger"/stronger than a standard bock.  In terms of how higher "maltiness" is accomplished, that would depend on the specific beer; mashing at high temperatures, reducing lautering, using certain grains or different yeasts, and other factors all can increase the maltiness of the final product.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A triple bock would just be a naming convention emphasizing even further the maltiness and alcoholic strength of the brew.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As an aside, doppelbocks are an evolution of strong monastic brews used as "liquid bread" for fasting monks, as they were not allowed to consume solid food.  These sweet, malty beers evolved over time into the modern doppelbock.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In short, prepare for a hangover. They pack a strong amount of alcohol (6-9% ABV), but you won't really taste it much. You're gonna get a lot of malt flavor, they're not very hoppy beers. So expect some sweet, fruity flavors. I'd recommend you give Allagash Dubbel Ale a try. It's a bit pricey (at like $12 for a 4-pack), but it's well worth it. I've never been disappointed by any beer from Allagash.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Now If you're curious, a Tripel is like a double, but they use three times the amount of malt than a standard Trappist "single", hence the name. So expect flavors similar to that of the dubbel, but much more pronounced. They are also higher in alcohol than a dubbel (9-12% ABV). For this style, my personal favorite, as of now (I've only had two of them) is Weyerbacher Brewing Co's Merry Monks Ale. The other one was the Allagash Tripel, which was also outstanding, but I'm partial to the Monks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As with any style, there's a fair deal of variation from one brewery to another.  At a high level, though, you can expect them to be darker (although not stout-dark), rich, and malty.  Expect a complex taste, with many notes and flavors.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;More specifically, the BJCP have this to say (abridged):&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aroma&lt;/strong&gt;: malty sweetness, hints of caramel or chocolate, and moderate fruity esters.  Some will have a little spice to them.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appearance&lt;/strong&gt;:  Dark amber to copper in color, Large, dense head.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taste&lt;/strong&gt;: Same as aroma. Alcohol flavor, if any, should be mild and not solvent-y.  No or minimal hop flavor.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mouthfeel&lt;/strong&gt;: Medium-full body. Medium-high carbonation.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.homebrewtalk.com/wiki/index.php/Belgian_Dubbel#Competition_Styles"&gt;See here&lt;/a&gt; for the full description.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Well, Saison is quite a broad category simply because it comes from a broad definition. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The original term comes from regular strength light ales ca. 3.5% abv) brewed during the Autumn in Belgium, and stored for drinking in the summer by farm workers. (Hence the pseudonym "farmhouse ale".) &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As wikipedia states:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Historically, saisons did not share identifiable characteristics to
					  pin them down as a style, but rather were a group of refreshing summer
					  ales made by farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In modern times, the category has been interpreted to mean:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;a light to golden ale&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;use the Dupont yeast, which gives particular esters and pepper characteristics (hence they have a "Belgian" character)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;around 7% abv&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;fruity, spicy (some examples add fruit, such as apple juice.)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;highly carbonated&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This might seem quite vague, but the combination of yeast, light malt, strength and carbonation lead to a fairly unique and identifiable beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I agree with mdma that it's traditionally more of a historical definition than a stylistic one.  To expand on their answer, though, in 2008, the BJCP defined a saison as the following (abridged):&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aroma&lt;/strong&gt;: Moderate sweetness with light, grainy, spicy wheat aromatics, often with a bit of tartness. Some coriander, with a complex herbal, spicy, or peppery note in the background. Moderate zesty, citrusy orangey fruitiness.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appearance&lt;/strong&gt;: Very pale straw to very light gold in color.  Cloudy.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flavor&lt;/strong&gt;: Pleasant sweetness and a zesty, orange-citrusy fruitiness.  Crisp with a dry, tart, finish. Can have a low wheat flavor. Optionally has a very light lactic-tasting sourness. Herbal-spicy flavors, which may include coriander and other spices; subtle + not overpowering.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mouthfeel&lt;/strong&gt;: Medium-light to medium body; effervescent character from high carbonation. Minimal bitterness in finish.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For more detail, see the &lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style16.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;full version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beers served on nitro have only about 25-40% of the dissolved carbon dioxide compared to regular beers served only on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  For stouts, the figure is usually closer to 25% - 40% is for lagers served on nitro. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With only 25% of the carbon dioxide, there is less concern of creating too large a foam. Plus the nitrogen causes the foam to be made of very very small bubbles, which readily turn back into beer. You can see this as the cascade &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lutxECdGWs8"&gt;(video)&lt;/a&gt; after the beer has been poured hard into the glass.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the beer served on nitro has more than 35% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; then it's a good idea to reduce how hard you pour - as the percentage of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increases, so does the size of the foam with a hard pour. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;OG stands for "original gravity", which is the &lt;em&gt;density&lt;/em&gt; of the liquid, before fermentation in the case of beer.  Another "gravity" you may hear is "final gravity", or FG: the density of the beer &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; fermentation.  Typically, gravity is expressed as thousandths over 1.0, where 1.0 is water.  However, Gnarly Oak says that their Winter Bock has an OG of 15, which is likely in degrees Plato.  I leave it to other answers to thoroughly explain what that is.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The density, of course, is increased by the sugar and other "good stuff" that makes beer, well, beer.  After the yeast has eaten the sugar and produced alcohol, you can measure the final gravity.  What makes this interesting is that if you have the OG and the FG, you can calculate your alcohol by volume with a &lt;a href="http://wiki.homebrewersassociation.org/specificgravitymeasurements" rel="nofollow"&gt;little math&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am completely unfamiliar with RDF, however.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'll answer one half and leave the other half to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;OG is “Original Gravity”&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Specific Gravity (often shorted to just ‘gravity’) is a measure of the density of a liquid.  Since its is mostly water, you can compare beer’s density to water to find out how much other stuff is in it.  Water has a gravity of 1.000, and beers will often have an original gravity of 1.200 to 1.020.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;“Original Gravity” is the density of beer before it’s fermented (when it’s called ‘wort’), and “Final Gravity” is the density after it’s fermented.  You can determine the alcohol content of a beer by comparing the two gravities and inferring how much fermentable “stuff” disappeared during fermentation (i.e., was converted to alcohol and CO2).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In commercial beer, you can use OG as a shorthand for how “Big” the beer is because it indicates how much malt and other fermentable stuff was in it.  So a lighter-flavored beer like a blonde or a pilnser will often have a low original gravity (1.020 to 1.050, for example), whereas a big stout or barelywine might have a higher original gravity (1.080 up to as much as 1.200).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;OG is in important measurement for home brewers, so another use of it on a commercial beer is to help people produce clones of said beer at home by reproducing the OG (among other factors).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h3&gt;Definition&lt;/h3&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To get a little more technical, Specific Gravity is the ratio of the density of one liquid to another.  In brewing, we always use water.  So, the density of water divided by the density of water is 1.000.  The density of beer divided by the density of water is what we refer to as ‘gravity’ when discussing beer.  And since it’s a ratio of two identical measures, there are no units.  It’s not 1.000 somethings; it’s just 1.000.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h3&gt;Plato&lt;/h3&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Homebrewers often use "brewer's points" (eg 1.123), but you'll sometimes see the "Plato Scale", which is more popular in central Europe.  A good approximation is that 1˚ plato = 4 brewer's points.  So 12˚ Plato corresponds to a gravity of 1.048.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From the figures you posted,&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;OG - "Original Gravity". When measured with a hydrometer, it measures the density relative to water. E.g. 1.010 is 1% heavier than water. The units here are &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_measurement#Strength" rel="nofollow"&gt;degrees Plato&lt;/a&gt; (&amp;deg;P), which describe the amount of dissolved sugars. Here, 15 means 15% dissolved sugar. This means the beer (or more correctly, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wort" rel="nofollow"&gt;wort&lt;/a&gt;) contained 15% sugar before fermentation started.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;RDF - The real degree of fermentation. This is in contrast to the Apparent Degree of Fermentation, which is (OG-FG)/OG. When the final gravity is measured using hydrometer, the alcohol in the beer, being less dense than water (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol" rel="nofollow"&gt;SG. 0.789&lt;/a&gt;) causes the gravity to appear lower, so it looks as though the yeast has fermented more sugar than it actually has. The Real degree of Fermentation takes the alcohol into account and computes the actual amount of sugars fermented. This tells you the how much of the original sugar was fermented (as a percentage). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, what does this mean in practice?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Winter Bock - 15 OG, 62.5 RDF - light, tasty, ever so slightly bitter&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This has an average RDF for a beer that size, so it will be somewhat malty, but not cloying.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Hazelnut Dark - 15 OG, 60.4 RDF - nice bitter red with slightly sweet aftertaste&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This has more dissolved sugars in it compared to the Bock, so you'd expect it to be a thicker mouthfeel and slightly more sweet, although you may not taste the sweetness if it's offset by roasted malts.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Chocolate Stout - 14.8 OG, 66.8 RDF - very sweet with hints of chocolate and malt&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Being the driest of all the beers, yet the taste description is given as very sweet. This shows that knowing the residual sugars doesn't tell you the sweetness, simply because there are different kinds of residual sugar. For example, dextrins create body, but have relatively little taste, so would taste not as sweet as a beer containing a lot of residual maltose or glucose. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I expect a high alcohol beer, with a lot of complex flavors.  One that the alcohol content will "sneak" up on you because it isn't very obvious in the taste.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Quoting from the &lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style18.php#1c"&gt;Beer Judge Criteria&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Aroma: Complex with moderate to significant spiciness, moderate
					  fruity esters and low alcohol and hop aromas. Generous spicy, peppery,
					  sometimes clove-like phenols. Esters are often reminiscent of citrus
					  fruits such as oranges, but may sometimes have a slight banana
					  character. A low yet distinctive spicy, floral, sometimes perfumy hop
					  character is usually found. Alcohols are soft, spicy and low in
					  intensity. No hot alcohol or solventy aromas. The malt character is
					  light. No diacetyl.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Appearance: Deep yellow to deep gold in color. Good clarity.
					  Effervescent. Long-lasting, creamy, rocky, white head resulting in
					  characteristic “Belgian lace” on the glass as it fades.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Flavor: Marriage of spicy, fruity and alcohol flavors supported by a
					  soft malt character. Low to moderate phenols are peppery in character.
					  Esters are reminiscent of citrus fruit such as orange or sometimes
					  lemon. A low to moderate spicy hop character is usually found.
					  Alcohols are soft, spicy, often a bit sweet and low in intensity.
					  Bitterness is typically medium to high from a combination of hop
					  bitterness and yeast-produced phenolics. Substantial carbonation and
					  bitterness lends a dry finish with a moderately bitter aftertaste. No
					  diacetyl.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body, although lighter than the
					  substantial gravity would suggest (thanks to sugar and high
					  carbonation). High alcohol content adds a pleasant creaminess but
					  little to no obvious warming sensation. No hot alcohol or solventy
					  character. Always effervescent. Never astringent.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Overall Impression: Strongly resembles a Strong Golden Ale but
					  slightly darker and somewhat fuller-bodied. Usually has a more rounded
					  malt flavor but should not be sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Comments: High in alcohol but does not taste strongly of alcohol. The
					  best examples are sneaky, not obvious. High carbonation and
					  attenuation helps to bring out the many flavors and to increase the
					  perception of a dry finish. Most Trappist versions have at least 30
					  IBUs and are very dry. Traditionally bottle-conditioned (“refermented
					  in the bottle”).&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;History: Originally popularized by the Trappist monastery at
					  Westmalle.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Ingredients: The light color and relatively light body for a beer of
					  this strength are the result of using Pilsner malt and up to 20% white
					  sugar. Noble hops or Styrian Goldings are commonly used. Belgian yeast
					  strains are used – those that produce fruity esters, spicy phenolics
					  and higher alcohols – often aided by slightly warmer fermentation
					  temperatures. Spice additions are generally not traditional, and if
					  used, should not be recognizable as such. Fairly soft water.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, to clear up the myth.   European beer is not served warm.  Some beers, such as real ale (or cask ale) are served at cellar temperature, which while certainly above the temperature of a beer fresh out a refrigerator, at 12-14 degrees celsius (53-57F) is still much colder than room temperature.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To answer your question:&lt;/strong&gt;  Mulled beer &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; heated beer.  As with wine, mulled beer is usually warmed over a low stove or in a crockpot with spices, often including cinnamon, nutmeg, citrus zest, and a sweetener like brown sugar, but it doesn't &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to include any additional ingredients, particularly if it already has strong spice or fruit characteristics.  So, any beer style that you heat is, in fact, mulled beer.     &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As to styles of beer that would be suitable for mulling, Belgian Strong Dark ales would be good candidates, as would nice fruity lambics.   Barleywine ales, milk stouts, chocolate stouts, and oatmeal stouts I would imagine might also be nice.  The characteristics I'd look for would be a heavy body, more malty than hoppy, a bit of sweetness, and if present, dark fruit (plumbs, figs, raisins) or berries.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am a big fan of tripels and quadrupels.  They are dark, and much smoother, I find, than blondes and other lower-alcohol beers (and yes, tripels are substantially more alcoholic).  Contrary to the previous answer, I find they taste less bitter than typical beers, although perhaps it may be because the bitterness is masked by the other flavors perhaps?  It may depend, though; Chimay yellow label has a note of bitterness that I don't find in, say, a Westmalle.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Part of it depends on what you're used to.  If you're used to mass-market beers you will find these very different.  Heavier and more substantial.  Richer, more luxurious.  Very much not something you quaff down a few at a time to quench your thirst; these are savored.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are also quadrupels, such as the Roquefort 10 or Westvleteren XII, which are even better in my mind. These are very dark and pack an alcoholic punch.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Dubbels and Tripels are vastly different beers. While dubbels are generally something akin to a brown ale, malt forward with some light hints of dark fruit and roastiness, Tripels are pale to golden, being a vehicle for both the yeast flavors (clove/bananna), fruity esters, and the whims of the brewer (Belgian candi sugar, coriander and other spices are common additions).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The additional Trappist style ale the Quadripel (Quad) is much more like a bigger version of the dubbel, although they have their own distinct flavor profiles as well. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's often a misconception that one comes forth from the other, this is incorrect. The name was used to indicate the strength of the Westmalle beers. Originally there was the Enkel, Dubbel and Tripel. It is said that they represent the holy trinity. Later quadruppels were added. Both Dubbel and Tripel as name were first used by the Trappist brewery of Westmalle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Westmalle produced the first dark beer in 1856 named "Dubbel" (the recipe was changed in 1926). Dubbels are dark in color, and tend to have malt flavors dominating over hops. Whereas the Quadrupels have more of a fruit presence, the Dubbels tend to be a bit spicier with strong caramel flavors. They tend to have an ABV of 6.5-9.0%.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Chimay Red&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;La Trappe Dubbel&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Ommegang&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Westvleteren 8 &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Rochefort 6&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Westmalle Dubbel&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Tripels are lighter color, often blonde. They are generally a lot fruitier and lighter in flavor. The name Tripel originally was first used in 1956 by the Westmalle brewery to name their strongest beer (originally produced in 1930 and named Superbier, it was renamed to Tripel). The ABV is a lot higher than the double,  8.0-12.0%. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Tripel Karmeliet&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Westmalle Tripel&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;St. Bernardus Tripel&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Leuvense Tripel&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Chimay Cinq Cents Tripel &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes, they are related. The pilsner beer style got its name from the city of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plze%C5%88"&gt;Pilsen&lt;/a&gt;, in what is now the Czech Republic, where the beer was first brewed in 1842.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A Belgian Double is an amber/brown beer of usually 6-7.5% ABV (They can drift higher).  The style was most likely originated at Westmalle in the mid 19th Century.  While Trappist abbeys tend to be the origin and driver of the style, many secular Belgian breweries produce them as Abbey beers which may have actually been a brewing monastery at one point or simply as a Dubbel.  They're not as popular amongst American brewers as triples though.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as flavor profile, it's a malty but dry beer.  The Belgian abbey yeast strains will ferment the beer fairly dry but will create a whole host of fruity esters and spicy phenols that will add to the mid range caramel malts.  Many of the Trappist versions have attenuation of 80%-90%.  Westmalle Dubbel, Chimay Red Label, New Belgium Abbey, St. Martin Brune are all good examples of the style.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With regards to AudiFanatic's answer, In this case, Beer Advocate is wrong in their description of a Triple. Triples do NOT use 3x's the malt as a Single.  No brewer will tell you that, nor is it true historically.  Malt extraction is linear, meaning 3x's the malt will be 3x's the alcohol.  The closest you get to that is historically when the single was the 3rd running (like a small beer). With this method, the 1st run had triple the fermentables extracted than the 3rd run.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And while I may only be a blogger, with 13 years of industry experience, I spoke with highly trained brewmasters and read references written by authoritative experts.  I'm pretty sure my answer article is more accurate than the Beer Advocate's, in this case.  Also, the flavor profile of a triple does not have "flavors similar" to a dubbel.  Dark malt and light malt will give very different flavors. The only Triple that has similar flavor is Stift Engelzell's triple, which is a unique dark triple, as they're labeling it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bitterness_Units_scale#Bitterness"&gt;International Bittering Units (IBUs)&lt;/a&gt; are a measure of bitterness in a beer.  As such, the distinguishing factor is bitterness.  :)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Since hops are the primary contributor to bitterness in beer, high IBU beers also tend to be hoppy (although that's not always the case, since hops added at certain points in the brewing process contribute mostly to bitterness, while hops added at other points contribute mostly to hop aroma and flavor).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As an aside, heavier beers (specifically, those with lots of malt) will taste less bitter than a lighter beer with the same IBU.  To elaborate:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;there is still the complication that IBUs do not really correlate with perceived bitterness because other aspects of beer affect the perception of bitterness. For example, two beers containing 25 IBUs will be perceived very different with respect to bitterness if one beer had an O.G. of 10 °Plato and finished at 1.5 °Plato and the other beer had an O.G. of 12.5 °Plato and finished at 2.5 °Plato. Begin varying the malt bill by adding crystal malt, for example, and changing the content of various water salts and things become even muddier. This is the reason that measures like the IBU are extremely useful when used within a population of similar beers, but not so handy when looking at very different populations.

					&lt;p&gt;The brewery really needs to indicate how they get the 300 IBU measurement. Most just work it out from the hops they add using hop bitterness &lt;a href="http://www.rooftopbrew.net/ibu.php"&gt;calculators&lt;/a&gt;, rather than it being an actual measurement of the bittering compounds in the beer. For highly hopped beers, the calculated IBUs can be far off compared to reality - above around 100 IBUs it becomes more and more difficult to increase the IBUs of the beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://beersensoryscience.wordpress.com/2010/11/06/bitterness/"&gt;isomerized alpha acids&lt;/a&gt; that give the bitterness are only marginally soluble in wort (they are hydrophobic), and their solubility decreases as more is dissolved: solubility decreases with lower pH and dissolving the iso-acids lowers the pH, so solubility is self-limiting. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Thus, labels with over 100 IBUs should not be considered accurate, unless the brewer has specifically measured the IBUs in the beer, rather than guessed them from the hop regime.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As stated above, if you want to know about a certain style the &lt;a href="http://bjcp.org/2008styles/catdex.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;BJCP guidelines&lt;/a&gt; are a great place to start.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not all styles are reflected in the BJCP guidelines though.  For instance, the BJCP doesn't recognize Black IPAs, or American Wild Ales.  The &lt;a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/style" rel="nofollow"&gt;Beer Advocate style guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, and the guidelines from the &lt;a href="http://www.greatamericanbeerfestival.com/the-competition/beer-styles/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Great American Beer Festival&lt;/a&gt; might also be useful to you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With regard to your specific question about Tripels, you can read my own thoughts about them on my blog (I'm trying to drink all the BJCP styles are write about them):&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Given that your question asked about a "pale pilsen" the answer would be that this is in a way a pleonasm since Pilsner/Pils/Pilsen is a lager beer brewed with pale malt and therefore pale by definition. The only not so super pale Pilsner I've seen so far is the Imperial Pilsner "Draft Bear" by Mikkeller which still is quite pale and also a very lose interpretation of the style.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Depends what you mean with Belgian Triple. As I understand in the US it is used as a style name and it is base on the Westmalle Triple. You can see the style discription in the answer of Schleis. But if you want to know what to expect, try Westmalle Triple, it's a good (my preferred) benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In Belgium it's not a style. It's merely a label to mark that more ingredient were used, comparatively with the other beers within the same brewery.
					A little history:
					The ingredients to make beer were expensive in the middle ages, so the brewers tried to use as little as possible for there beer. There was however also an market for more tasteful, more expensive, beer. To differentiate between the brewed barrels they used X for the cheap bear, XX for the expensive one. Not saying that there were double the ingredients in it, just more. Later came also XXX. You can still find these X's on some labels these days.
					The name Triple is a more recent appellation (1930's), but it is based on the same idea.
					A classic trio you find in Belgium, but with a lot of exceptions, is a blond(X), a brown (XX, double) and a strong blond ale (XXX, triple). These are relative references, within the brewery and like already mentioned, more ingredients, not doubling or tripling the amount of ingredients. Making the beers stronger in alcohol and taste.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I guess you now also know what to expect with a quadruple...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's likely just naming differences.  Though the BJCP has distinct categories for "Dark American Lager" and "Schwarzbier (Black Beer)".  The main difference seems to be that Dark lager is sweeter and more towards caramel malt than Black which is more dry and slightly roasty.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a Belgian chap, I obviously love our beer :). More specific, my favorite beers are always tripel beers.
					The thing about tripel beers is that the fermentation is achieved further in the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In general I can tell you all tripel beers are always pretty blonde looking (maybe slightly darker) and doubles are always darker (like really brown!).
					In Belgium, we would call a double beer a dark beer (Double Leffe we would call: Donkere Leffe or Dark Leffe in English).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The taste of double beers will always be sweeter while tripel beers are far more bitter.
					I don't like those sweet drinks so I very much prefer tripel beers.
					However, all tripel beers are different from each other so there is not a real way of describing them. In general bitter, but there are sweeter tripels as well...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The difference in taste between blonde and tripel beers in general is that tripel beers have far more flavors (= more expensive) than blonde beers. The sad thing is that blonde beers are very popular and I don't even know why... Tripel beers have way more flavors :).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a side note, my favorite beers are: Tripel Karmeliet and Tripel Kasteelbier.
					The more poular (blonde) beers are Duvel and Leffe for example. Both in my opinion hugely overrated beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Similar to the new question, 'what temperature should I serve my beer', which I've just commented on - serving warm beer is largely a myth! The continental Europeans think British beer is served 'luke-warm'. No. Cool, not ice-cold is the preference, at a cellar temp around 13C (room temp being 20-22C). Not sure where the OP is from, but they appear to believe that all Europeans drink warm to hot beer&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I really thought the myth of warm or luke-warm beer had dissipated - obviously not. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I don't think there's a site dedicated to that purpose specifically. However, &lt;a href="https://untappd.com/"&gt;Untapped&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.beermenus.com/"&gt;Beermenus&lt;/a&gt; are probably your best bets. I've never used Untapped as I do not have a smartphone and I think they've just recently added desktop/laptop support, but I have used Beermenus. It's ok, not great though. Again, it's really up to the brewery/bar to update their menu and sometimes they just forget; they're human too, despite being able to brew some godly beers. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But in general, this question is a bit too broad. in my opinion. You don't specify whether or not you're talking about local beers or just beers in general. There's a few thousand breweries worldwide; many of them coming out with new releases regularly. Keeping tabs on all of them would be somewhat of a challenge (especially the ones who don't update their sites regularly (&lt;a href="http://www.fireislandbeer.com/"&gt;ahem...if my local friends across the bay are on here, I'm looking at you&lt;/a&gt;). So in terms of local beers, Untapped and Beermenus should do what you're looking for. But At this point in time, I think a global list is infeasible until somebody develops an easy-to-use API which gets some traction in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Using the BeerAdvocate web site could be very helpful. As a craft beer enthusiast, I've used it on my travels.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Start your search at the following URL: &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/place/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.beeradvocate.com/place/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can break down your search results by Continent, Country, City and State. You may be able to find some local breweries that fit your liking. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, you can stay on top of all the latest beer release news by going to the following forum: &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/community/forums/beer-releases.38/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.beeradvocate.com/community/forums/beer-releases.38/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I will update this answer when I get more information from OP about region but I believe the following will be helpful: [edit]: reread the tags and spotted that it was US - think that my thoughts all still stand up but will check some specifics on US beer festivals.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the UK and a few other countries and regions organizations like CAMRA (the Campaign for Real Ale) run beer festivals which work out, on a pint for pint basis, cheaper when trying a wide variety of beers. Although there is usually an entry fee (at least as far as CAMRA events go) each drink tends to be cheaper and there is the option of trying more different beers by buying in half pint measures (recommended). The biggest benefit of going to festivals, however, is the &lt;em&gt;range&lt;/em&gt; of beers available. A liquor store / off license / bar can only really stock a few different beers and these are usually ones that they can get consistently, in volume, and at either a suitable price or within their tie (don't get me started on the beer tie), whereas festivals are much freer to buy different beers from varying sources as they are one-off events and less restricted.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A second idea would be to set up a tasting club so that you can share the costs and the beers. This runs the risk (!) of making new friends as well!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;source: I help to run a CAMRA beer festival and work at 2+ others dependent on my free time&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can look for breweries in your areas that give tours. These often include free tastings. (Since you mentioned you're from the Chicago area, I know there's a bus tour that takes you to different breweries in Chicago and Milwaukee. There's a fee, but you'd get to try a lot of different beers.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, look for brewpubs and restaurants in your area that sell &lt;em&gt;flights&lt;/em&gt; of beer. A flight is 4-5 samples of different beers served together. The cost is normally about the same as a full glass, and the total volume is usually the same or a little more. This allows you to try 4 or 5 different beers for about the same price as you'd normally pay for one.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most beer shops and some grocery stores (if that's legal in your state) allow you to do a "Mixer-Sixer" or "Create your own six-pack" where you can combine a variety of single bottles/cans for a variety six pack.  You pay a little bit extra per bottle for the convenience but and you get to pick specifically which ones you try.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To learn your preferences, I would suggest the following styles: (ordered from darkest to lightest with a recommended beer in parenthesis)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Stout (Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Double Bock/Doppelbock (Ayinger Doppelbock)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;IPA (Dogfish Head 60min or 90min IPA)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Pale Ale (Sierra Nevada Pale Ale)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Pilsner (Bell's Beer by Bells Brewery - this is a traditional Czech Pilsner)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Hefeweizen (Paulaner Bavarian Hefeweizen)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;@Bill The Lizard's answer:  Going on a brewery tour is definitely good advice.  Additionally, you should consider getting beer on tap which tends to be fresher and in better condition while at restaurants or breweries.  Furthermore, if you have the chance to visit a brewery, you should specifically try their seasonal, limited, and special releases.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you venture west to Iowa most HyVee stores will let you do the mixer-sixer as Gastrograph describes. Two of Iowa's best breweries are on the eastern side of the state as well in Toppling Goliath and Backpocket.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I live in a state that (mostly) requires that you buy beer by the case.  I feel your pain.  ("Mostly": there's still the bar option, and there are a very few places where you can buy mixed cases or six-packs of things other than the big mainstream beers.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The solution I'm partial to is the beer co-op.  Mine started as a group of coworkers; we've scattered to a bunch of different companies by now, but the co-op remains.  Every 4-6 weeks the organizer sends out email announcing a planned buy, with the goal of getting a multiple of 8 people (12 works, but we prefer 8).  Participants get a case with variety of beers and divide the total cost.  I've gotten to sample some beers I'd never have tried (or known about) otherwise.  (Most people don't participate every time, but the organizer does because, hey, beer.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're doing a co-op anyway, then it's easy to add on the occasional "side buy" -- something that comes in 25oz bottles, or is particularly expensive, etc.  So long as there's enough interest to get the case, people can then buy them individually.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can be very organized about this, requiring commitments in advance, or you can be flexible and deal with the occasional surplus.  People interested enough to organize co-ops &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; don't mind some surplus (assuming finances aren't too tight).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I can imagine multiple reasons. I assume that Rothaus owns the patents to this kind of glueless neckpaper fixing what leds to a feeling belonging to the 1337 group of zäpfle-fans as the common germann biertrinker is always prowd of his local beer. First, this kind of wrapping the top makes sence from an hyenic point of view. Second, since they wrap their aluminium foil, which is thick compared to others, not just around the neck but also over the cab, you may have realised that the artifacts caused from opening the bottle feels uncomfortable on the lips. But most important, biertrinkers are way conservative on anything related to their local beer. Prost!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm from Germany. Don't care too much about this. Just remove that part of it which would be disturbing when drinking, since some minor pieces might get into the glass or into your mouth directly if you are drinking out of the bottle, which is common in Germany, except in a restaurant or during a dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also you wouldn't normally remove the gold paper &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; opening the bottle. Most of the parts will getting removed &lt;em&gt;automatically&lt;/em&gt; when opening it. You just need to remove the remaining, disturbing parts, if there are any left. Try it! ;)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That's all you need to know. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Barley wine is a style of beer: it isn't something that is made using beer as an ingredient (as you might describe whisky).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a number of varieties of barley wine (some hoppy, and some with almost no hop characteristics), but they all have a relatively high alcohol content compared to most beers.  The alcohol is produced via fermentation, the same as any other beer, and without distillation.  Note that not all high alcohol beers are necessarily described as "barley wine" though.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for the legal aspects, I don't know of any regulations that specifically target barley wine.  The law usually deals with alcoholic beverages based on the alcohol content, and from that point of view barley wines would usually be treated similar to normal wines due to the similar ABV.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Well, brewers typically control pH during the fermentation process top avoid unwanted bacterial growth, etc., fermentation actually doesn't even happen below ~4. So not a significant difference.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sure, there are major differences in acidity. Unsurprisingly, the sour beer styles can have very low pH levels. &lt;a href="http://www.themadfermentationist.com/2011/11/measuring-sour-beer-ph.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Here's&lt;/a&gt; an example of someone measuring the pH of sour beers and finding that even within that category there are significant differences. &lt;a href="http://www.weyermann.de/downloads/pdf/Weyermann_TKW_Mash-pH_2010.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;Here's&lt;/a&gt; a short presentation showing that expected pH ranges from 3.2-3.4 for Berliner Weisse to 4.5-4.8 for pilsner and bock. So, yes, there are definitely major differences, and they do matter to the perception of the finished product. At the most obvious level, low-pH beers actually taste sour. There are also indications that smaller pH variations matter to how people perceive the flavour.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The BJCP classifies Corona Extra as a &lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style01.php#1c"&gt;Premium American Lager&lt;/a&gt;, being, clear, yellow, not hoppy but with a little more body than a light. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Assuming 'dry' isn't some radically different beer, the category would probably still be correct. BJCP draft guidelines (not official) consider putting Asahi Super Dry and Corona Extra in  2A 'International Pale Lagers' which is '&lt;em&gt;Loosely derived from original Pilsner-type lagers....&lt;/em&gt;'&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Grimbergen Cuvee Blanche is in the style of a Belgian Witbeer aka "White Beer". There are are countless similar beers that are widely available.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The archetype for the style is named Hoegaarden. The creator of Hoegaarden, Peter Celis, created another beer in the same style named Celis White. In the U.S., the most widely available example of this style is Blue Moon Belgian Wheat.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Belgian Wit / Belgian Wheat style of beer has gained a lot of popularity in recent years and is an exceptionally easy style to find at any well-stocked bottle shop or craft beer bar in the US. Simply ask for that style and something similar to Grimbergen Blanche should be available. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hoegaarden is indeed the typical white beer. They now have a "Speciale" and limited "Grand Cru" which is very nice. May be hard to find depending on your location.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I really like the Grimbergen Blanche and find it quite similar to the "Blanche de Namur", one of my favourite white beer. So I suggest you to try this one ! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From the Beer Judge Criteria for an &lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style09.php#1d" rel="nofollow"&gt;Irish Red Ale&lt;/a&gt; which is what I would consider being the closest thing to a Red Lager (A couple of the examples are actually lagers).  This fits the bill for Rickard's Red.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Aroma: Low to moderate malt aroma, generally caramel-like but
					  occasionally toasty or toffee-like in nature. May have a light buttery
					  character (although this is not required). Hop aroma is low to none
					  (usually not present). Quite clean.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Appearance: Amber to deep reddish copper color (most examples have a
					  deep reddish hue). Clear. Low off-white to tan colored head.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Flavor: Moderate caramel malt flavor and sweetness, occasionally with
					  a buttered toast or toffee-like quality. Finishes with a light taste
					  of roasted grain, which lends a characteristic dryness to the finish.
					  Generally no flavor hops, although some examples may have a light
					  English hop flavor. Medium-low hop bitterness, although light use of
					  roasted grains may increase the perception of bitterness to the medium
					  range. Medium-dry to dry finish. Clean and smooth (lager versions can
					  be very smooth). No esters.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body, although examples containing
					  low levels of diacetyl may have a slightly slick mouthfeel. Moderate
					  carbonation. Smooth. Moderately attenuated (more so than Scottish
					  ales). May have a slight alcohol warmth in stronger versions.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Overall Impression: An easy-drinking pint. Malt-focused with an
					  initial sweetness and a roasted dryness in the finish.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Comments: Sometimes brewed as a lager (if so, generally will not
					  exhibit a diacetyl character). When served too cold, the roasted
					  character and bitterness may seem more elevated.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The criteria also has some examples of beers that you would like if you like this:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Three Floyds Brian Boru Old Irish Ale, Great Lakes Conway’s Irish Ale (a bit strong at 6.5%), Kilkenny Irish Beer, O’Hara’s Irish Red Ale, Smithwick’s Irish Ale, Beamish Red Ale, Caffrey’s Irish Ale, Goose Island Kilgubbin Red Ale, Murphy’s Irish Red (lager), Boulevard Irish Ale, Harpoon Hibernian Ale&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The red color usually comes from certain kinds of caramel malt, which comes in a range of colors but is usually used to make a sweeter, fuller-bodied beer than everyday pale ales and lagers. In this way, they're very similar to amber ale/lagers, and the difference can be very subtle and is very subjective. If you like one, you'll 99% of the time enjoy the other. Most of what you mentioned- like Dos Equis and Yuengling- are marketed as ambers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, I looked up Honest Lager, and Walkerville markets it as Märzen (sometimes but not always the same as Oktoberfest) It's less hoppy and more full-bodied than a Pils or other pale lager, and tends to be reddish or amber in color. If you look a the German/import section of your local beer store or supermarket, you should be able to find an example of something similar, just look for the words "Märzen," "Oktoberfest," "Festbier," etc. A Munich-style Dunkel would also probably be right up your alley. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Key words I would use: sweetish, medium-bodied, balanced, caramelly, toasty. But just think about different foods and aromas while you're drinking, and see what your impression is. Everybody's different.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you do want to use the BJCP guide, just remember that they're designed for judging homebrew competitions, and professional brewers don't have much reason to pay attention to them. So if you pick up a beer and it doesn't match up with its BJCP style, it's not a catastrophe, and the beer is still perfectly good!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As soon as I read "Red Lager" I thought to myself, this guy is probably looking for Vienna Lagers (aka Amber Lagers. For whatever reason beer marketers greatly prefer the term "amber" over "red" when referring to lagers, while using "red" over "amber" when referring to ales eg Red IPA). These are lagers with a slightly sweeter profile than the "standard International pilsner" style churned out by every macrobrewery, due to the addition of Vienna, crystal, and/or caramel malts. Indeed, when looking at the  examples you gave on Rate Beer and Beer Advocate, RB considers both to be of the "Amber Lager/Vienna" style, while BA considers Dos Equis to be a Vienna Lager and Yuengling to be an "American Amber/Red Lager". What's the difference? Generally, the "American" prefix at the start of any beer style means that it's hoppier, due to our lovefest with hops (at least compared to the Old World). Also, RB doesn't break amber lagers into American and not varieties.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can use the &lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beerstyles/amber-lager-vienna/36/" rel="nofollow"&gt;category page on Ratebeer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/30/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Beer Advocate&lt;/a&gt; to browse through more examples of the style. Ratebeer's list is default sorted by rating, which isn't always helpful if you don't live somewhere with a great selection, but you can click on "Count" and it will sort by number of ratings; Beer Advocate's is default sorted by number of reviews. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The two beers you mention are very widely available: On RB, Yuengling is #2 most reviewed and Dos Equis is #7; for rating though neither cracks the top 50. On BA, Dos Equis is the #3 Vienna Lager by reviews and #38 by rating, while Yuengling is the #1 American Amber/Red Lager by reviews and #21 by rating. For some great examples of Vienna/Amber Lagers you might be able to find, Sam Adams Boston Lager is rated #44 on RB and #3 on Beer Advocate (why the big discrepancy? RB users tend to be more heavily biased by the idea that certain breweries aren't "cool", while BA users tend to be more objective).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is always the BJCP guide, which makes the rules that guide most homebrewing and professional contests such as the GABF. The GABF can have real reputation and financial influence for a brewery, so it requires very precise definitions, but outside of competitions most of the brewing world takes the BJCP with a grain of salt (or is it a grain of barley?). Personally, I prefer the Ratebeer and Beer Advocate's style categorizations. Not that they are perfect either - part of the beauty of craft beer is that it is ever-evolving, and brewer creativity knows no category bounds - but it is more democratic and reflective of actual market tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are willing to go a little further afield, you might try a Scottish Ales, like Founders Dirty Bastard (www.ratebeer.com/beer/founders-dirty-bastard-scotch-ale/11498/); a Red IPA (not an official style) such as Troegs Nugget Nectar (www.ratebeer.com/beer/troegs-nugget-nectar-ale/30812/); or even a Bière de Garde, France's only indigenous beer style (these are harder to find, but I bet they have them in Montreal. try www.ratebeer.com/beerstyles/biere-de-garde/58/ or www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/127/.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You have to think of the volume of beer that's actually made. The big 'non-craft' brewers produce huge amounts of lager because the tradition for last hundred years or so has been to make lighter, more 'drinkable' beers. That also happens to fit with the big business ideal of being cheap to produce (light &amp;amp; drinkable means corn &amp;amp; rice are OK!). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Craft brewer tend to make ales for a few reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Prior to the explosion of lagers, most beer in the world was ale, and
					there are many more styles &amp;amp; different kind of yeast to choose from
					if you make ale.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Most ales can be produced faster than lagers, which is helpful when
					your brewery is small.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Ales are easier to make at home, so home brewers are quite familiar
					with these styles (and sometimes become pros as well).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.brewersassociation.org/statistics/national-beer-sales-production-data/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Numbers&lt;/a&gt;: as of last year, the thousands of craft breweries in the US still only had 11% of market share. Big breweries still crank out ~3/4 of US consumption, nearly all lager.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The first one that comes to mind is Saison Dupont. It's an exemplar of the Belgian saison style.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Allagash uses some historical methods, but their primary goal is definitely making excellent beer and not historical accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the &lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/stylecenter.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;BJCP style guidelines&lt;/a&gt; if you find the style you're interested in they'll list a couple beers that are true to style. Those may or may not be historically accurate, but they will be definitive examples of a style.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Depending on where you live you might be able to find a local brewery that's doing some sort of a recreation of an older style.  In the Massachusetts area Pretty Things Beer &amp;amp; Ale Project does a series of 1800s English ales called Once Upon a Time.  Beer historian Ron Pattinson helps them design all those recipes based on his research, so they should be fairly accurate.  Dogfish Head has a similar series called Ancient Ales which are best-guess recreations of VERY ancient middle eastern and asian beers based on archeological evidence...studying the chemical residue left on beer containers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You might be able to find some recreations by Brouwerij de Molen who also tapped Ron Pattinson to consult.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Traditional Belgian styles are unlikely to have changed significantly, so those are an option.  The smaller niche styles don't evolve as quickly, though the methods will be updated so they won't be as accurate as deliberate recreations.  Saison Dupont was mentioned.  Fantome springs to mind as well.  Certain sour beers like Faro or Gueuze Lambics should be close, but avoid the fruity ones.  Gose and Berlinerweisse might fit as well.  A lot of those European sour brewers have been doing things basically the same way for like 500 years.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you can find anyone brewing a Sahti that would be an interesting adventure.  I've also heard rumor of a few recreations of styles like Gratzer/Grodziskie, I think New Belgium might make one...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;On the smaller scale, if you're &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; interested see if you can find Frank Clark or Bob Grossman at a conference you might be able to get them to let you try a historic recreation beer, they generally work in the 1600s-1700s.  Frank Clark works as a food historian at Colonial Williamsburg so he should be easy to track down.  But I warn you, you probably don't want to actually drink the majority of that stuff.  Brewing was very different back in the day and a lot of their beers are pretty foul to modern tastes.  Differently prepared sugars and odd herbs and spices.  Stuff like boiling molasses until it literally lights on fire then fermenting it...kilning grains until some of the kernels straight explode and burn.  And let's not even get into stuff like cock ale, which had a parboiled rooster added during secondary fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sorry, that got ramble-y, but the gist was:  Pretty Things Once Upon a Time if you can get it.  Anything involving Ron Pattinson.  Dogfish Head Ancient Ales.  Traditional Belgian Saisons.  Sour Beers: Lambic, Gueuze, Berlinerweisse, Gose, Gratzer, Flemish Red.  Frank Clark might let you drink really gross-tasting things that were technically considered beer in Colonial-era America.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is no significant difference in preparation between barley wine and any other strong ale, some barley wines are made with OG's as low as 1.062 (Smithwick's) and the main characteristic is they have very strong kilned malt flavors.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In my opinion Barley Wine is to Malt, what an IPA is to Hops. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A key distinction between barley wine and other strong ales is the presence of residual sugars. When made right, the yeast will be unable to finish fermentation due the high alcohol content. The remaining sugars should then provide the complex fruity/malty/toasty flavors mentioned in the bjcp guide.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When you're designing a recipe in software like Beersmith or Brewtoad they give you ranges for each style, so when you select a style you can tailor your recipe to be in the "acceptable range" for that style.  Obviously just hitting the numbers isn't going to make the correct beer, but these are quantitative numeric measures of variation over a style.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These dimensions are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Original/Final Gravity (Sugar in the beer before and after fermentation)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;SRM (Measure of Color)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;ABV&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;IBU (International Bitterness Units)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These don't describe a ton about the actual flavor of the beer, just things like color, strength, body/sweetness, bitterness.  Note that while the ABV is tied to the difference between gravities, final gravity is and independent measure of the "dryness" of the beer.  Color and Bitterness are also totally independent of the others so you can have beers at the light color and bitter end but sweet, or dry and dark.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can also check the BJCP guides which are for competitions to see what the "ideal" qualities of a given style are and then numerically grade a beer based on how well it meets those descriptions.  But they do describe what's allowed as variance for being considered "on style".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Of course plenty of brewers just don't care about that sort of thing and make beers how they like.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's obviously opinion at this point but I think there's value in trying many different beers even though they may be in a style you've had a ton of before.  Each beer is different and those subtle differences may be the differences that really make you like one beer over another.  Maybe not a ton of the same thing in the same session...  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;According to untapp'd I've tried 85 IPAs, though the actual number is much higher than that.  Some have tasted like feet and onions, some have tasted amazing.  But as many as I've had if I see some IPAs on a menu and kind of want to drink an IPA, I've got nothing to lose by trying the one I've never had before...it might be really good.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Absolutely there is.  It's an extraordinarily difficult task to even get a single recipe to taste the same when produced in different locations, such as when Sierra Nevada expanded and added an east coast brewery in North Carolina last year.   Different recipes, different ingredients, different water all effect the end result in ways that you can taste.  While some beers in a given style will absolutely end up tasting quite similarly, there will always be plenty of variation for you to pick up on and enjoy, particularly when tasting beers of a given style from different regions.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There was another source that I read (probably that 1000 page beer encyclopedia that I forgot the title of) where they said that a saison was made with whatever ingredients that were available at hand at that season.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That is really too warm as you will get fusel oils as a bi-product.  If you absolutely must do it in that high of a temperature, I would go with an ESB or something.  If you really are going to get into this, you may want to invest in an old refrigerator and maintain around 17 - 20 degrees for an ale.  Well worth the investment if you have the space and money!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I brew in South Florida with similar ambient temps during the spring-summer-autumn.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For beer styles, check out the saison, which enjoys a higher fermentation temperature. Wyeast 3724 has a temperature range of &lt;strong&gt;70-95F, 21-35C&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.whitelabs.com/yeast/wlp565-belgian-saison-i-yeast" rel="nofollow"&gt;attenuates up to 80%&lt;/a&gt;. I've had great success with this strain, even at the higher ends of the range.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://beerandwinejournal.com/high-temp-yeast/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Beer and Wine Journal&lt;/a&gt; has a nice list of yeasts that do well in higher temps.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;White Labs WLP550 (Belgian Ale) — 68–78°F (20–26 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;White Labs WLP566 (Belgian Saison II yeast) — 68–78°F (20–26 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;White Labs WLP568 (Belgian Style Saison Ale Yeast Blend) — 70–80 °F
					  (21–27 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;White Labs WLP065 (American Whiskey Yeast) — 75-82 °F (24–28 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;White Labs WLP655 (Belgian Sour Mix 1) — 80-85+ °F (27–29 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;White Labs WLP665 (Flemish Ale Blend) — 68-80°F (20 –27 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Wyeast 1214 (Belgian Abbey) — 68-78° F (20-24° C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Wyeast 1388 (Belgian Strong Ale) — 64-80° F (18-27° C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Wyeast 3724 (Belgian Saison) — 70-95 °F (21-35 ° C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Wyast 3725 (PC Biere de Garde) — 70-84 °F (21-29 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Wyeast 3763 (Roeselare Ale Blend) — 65-85 °F (18-30 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Wyeast 3787 (Trappist High Gravity) — 64-78 °F (18-25 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Wyeast 3822 (PC Belgian Dark Ale) — 65-80 °F (18-27 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Fermentis Safbrew T-58 — 12-25°C (54-77 °F)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Fermentis Safbrew WB-06 — 12-25°C (54-77 °F)&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're looking to bring the beer to a little bit below ambient (as fermentation is a bit of an exothermic process) try a small plastic tub full of cool water with the carboy in it wrapped in a towel. The towel will wick up cool water and evaporate, basically acting like a giant sweat gland!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Two types of beers might suit you, both are similar but with slightly different flavour profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;English mild ale has a lower alcoholic content than bitter or Guinness, generally dark coloured.  Theakstons make a particularly nice mild on an irregular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Scottish 60 shilling (60/-) or light beer is similar to mild but is generally slightly sweeter to suit the Scottish palate.  McEwan's 60/- is the one most commonly seen.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that this class of beer is generally out of favour in the UK despite efforts by the Campaign for Real Ale to revive interest.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Let's start off with beers that you're interested in, something akin to a black lager. I'm going to keep things focused on beer styles rather than particulars, since I do not know where you are nor what might be available for you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Dunkelweizen&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is a dark wheat beer with characteristics of a traditional wheat with caramel type flavors joining the mix. Not exactly stout-like, but more like your black lager in lightness.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Schwarzbier&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Schwarzbier means "black beer" in German. This is what you had with your  Köstritzer. It is a medium-bodied, malt-accented dark brew, very opaque and deep-sepia in color, with a chewy texture and a firm, creamy, long-lasting head. In spite of its dark color, it comes across as a soft and elegant brew that is rich, mild, and surprisingly balanced. It never tastes harsh, toasty or acrid.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Black IPA / Cascadian Dark Ale&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The American fascination with hops has shown that the addition of toasted malts can give a hoppy, bitter, and coffee-like experience to these beers. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Black Saisons&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Similar to the Black IPA, I've seen a few breweries start brewing their saisons with roasted malts. The usual light flavors of the saison are accented by this extra roasted character. It's never acrid, however. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Porters&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A lot of English porters are not heavy at all, and are generally akin to milds that have roasted malts added in. Look for lower ABV porters in the 4-5% range, and you'll probably find something you like.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly to many, Guinness is actually &lt;a href="http://time.com/25145/3-surprising-facts-about-guinness/"&gt;on par with any other beer of similar alcohol strength&lt;/a&gt;, as beer gets a majority of its calories from alcohol, &lt;a href="https://www.uhs.uga.edu/documents/nutrition_alcohol.pdf"&gt;about 7 per gram&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps much of the 'full' feeling is a product of the use of nitrogen in the mix which gives it that creamy texture. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are beer blends served in England and Scotland although it tends to be the older drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Mild and Bitter is one where a half pint of bitter is mixed with a half of mild.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Brown and Bitter is half of bitter with a brown ale such as Mann's.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A common Scottish blend is the Black and Tan which is Guinness and IPA/Heavy - this can also be made a Sweet Black and Tan by using sweet stout and IPA.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Before Fullers shut Gales of Horndean down they produced a bottled Christmas ale which was a mix of their HSB premium bitter and their 555 mild with spice.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;According to Graham Wheeler's article on the history of porter (which I cannot currently locate), London-style porter was originally a mixed-on-demand blend of mild and sour brown ales. "Butt porter" was a later version, blended at the brewery so it could be shipped in a single keg ("butt.")&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; Found it! The article was reposted in parts to the Homebrew Digest mailing list in 1996 &amp;amp; 1997 by Rob Moline.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_glassware" rel="nofollow"&gt;Beer glasses&lt;/a&gt; are mainly a product of the region in which the beer was originated and therefore tied to a specific beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Belgian beers - Normally served in &lt;a href="http://www.ohio.com/polopoly_fs/1.457872!/image/image.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_500/hullabaloo.png" rel="nofollow"&gt;goblets&lt;/a&gt; because the beers have very complex aromas and the shape of the glass can help present and concentrate them for consumption.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;British beers - Normally served in the "&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=images&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwisj7zvsZTKAhUU5mMKHQIIAIgQjRwIAw&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAuthentic-British-Imperial-nonic-Etched%2Fdp%2FB007A0OZFE&amp;amp;psig=AFQjCNEv-ePikHEN5cnuMubUwDuS70vW7g&amp;amp;ust=1452142330583350" rel="nofollow"&gt;nonic&lt;/a&gt;" glass.  Simply a glass that is easier to hold in the hand whilst standing around the pub. Normally associated with most British ales.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Pilsner - High sided &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=images&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjb2qXFspTKAhUW7mMKHQyeCAsQjRwIAw&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FKitchen-Tall-Beer-Glasses-14-4oz-410ml%2Fdp%2FB00BMGWVBC&amp;amp;psig=AFQjCNEgUeJUiOw0x1O2jGuwy-cLwqvEUg&amp;amp;ust=1452142510579203" rel="nofollow"&gt;flute&lt;/a&gt; to concentrate the hop aroma and show off the high carbonation of Pilsners.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weissbeir - German wheat beers are usually served in &lt;a href="http://transatlanticbrews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Craft-beer-glasses-at-Joes-Wine-Cellar.jpg" rel="nofollow"&gt;tall glasses&lt;/a&gt; to show off the cloudy beer and also the creamy tall head of foam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scottish Ale - a &lt;a href="http://www.homebrewtalk.com/gallery/data/1/thistleor.jpg" rel="nofollow"&gt;Thistle glass&lt;/a&gt; designed to evoke the image of the national flower of Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stout - Popularized by Guinness, a &lt;a href="http://www.bettycrocker.com/~/media/Images/Flex-Article/January2013/Beer-for-Dessert/StoutBeer.jpg" rel="nofollow"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; designed to show off the nitrogen bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It might sound snobbish to be peckish about the type of glass but the glass does influence the taste of the beer. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some things are:
					 - the thickness of the glass. A thin glass invites to a more delicate way of drinking, a really thick glass would let you expect a sturdier beer.
					 - the surface compared to the volume of beer. A big surface gives a change to let of more aroma's but I would think you also need a little more foam.
					 - the capacity to keep the aroma's. As pointed out by Rube. Think of a cognac glass versus a &lt;a href="http://www.bierwoordenboek.com/getfile.aspx?file=Glazen%2FAmsterdammer.gif" rel="nofollow"&gt;vase&lt;/a&gt;. Some glasses also take in you nose deeper than others.
					 - the way the beer flows. The shape of the glass how quickly you can drink it without spilling. Think of &lt;a href="http://www.potjebier.nl/bier_glazen.asp?f=show&amp;amp;id=14" rel="nofollow"&gt;kwak&lt;/a&gt;, you HAVE to drink the last very carefully.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So to answer your question: there are many factors how the glass influences how you taste a beer. What's best is very subjective. You could at first stick to the opinion of the brewer, what he finds the best glass for it. If you like the taste with an other glass better, use that. I would not approach this as a hard science. Brewers might choose a specific glass to "stand out".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In addition to blending different beers (like, blending an stout with an IPA, getting something like a black IPA), it's important to mention that almost all barrel aged beers are blends, because of the very nature of barrel aging.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When I mention barrel aged beers, I'm not just referring to the recent barrel aged styles which have been created by the american craft beer scene, but also to more traditional ones like the Belgian ones: lambic, flanders red and oud bruin.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Blending is crucial to beverages aged on barrels (even whisky or wine), because you never get a regular result from them. It depends heavily on the barrel itself (remember, it's wood, a biological element), the storage conditions of each of them (temperature, for example, which varies depending on the position of it in the warehouse) and some other random factors. So, the only way to achieve a consistent and reproducible product is blending, trying to fuse all those different characteristics in the right proportion, giving you an expected final product. In this process, is even common having to dump some barrels, which will not make it on the final proportion (maybe, let's say, you have too many very sour barrels, and you don't want your beer to be so that sour).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Additionally, another common practice is to blend aged beer with the young (not aged) version of it. Beers like Rodenbach, for example, are like this (Rodenbach Grand Cru has 2/3 of aged beer with 1/3 of fresh beer). Dogfish's Burton Barton is a blend of wood-aged and fresh IPA, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, blending beer is not exactly a new thing. I understand that your question was about blending different styles of beers, which is still less common, probably because the brewers will try to do that from the beginning, with the ingredients, but is not an heresy. We should try doing this more often, I dare to say.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Evil Twin Yin &amp;amp; Yang is one popular blend. They are brewed and sold separately as &lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/evil-twin-yin/142988/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Evil Twin Yin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/evil-twin-yang/142990/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Evil Twin Yang&lt;/a&gt;. There is also the blend that is bottled and sold, Evil Twin Yin &amp;amp; Yang, which is 1/3 stout (Yin) and 2/3 double IPA (Yang). I've also been to bars that have both the Yin and Yang on tap, and blend them for you in house.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That's a very broad question, and hard to answer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Very early on, hops weren't well known, and beer was made without hops; this likely would have caused the beer to be sweeter than it is today. Hops were known and added to beer relatively early in the Middle Ages, though.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Today, in my opinion, the key differences are variety and technology. Not only do we have a greater variety in styles, but we have more varieties of hops, malts, and different yeasts. These create wildly different flavor profiles unheard of centuries ago. Technology has allowed us to create more consistency in beers, as well as increasing variety indirectly through different techniques used in brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here's a pretty nice article on the history of beer: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_beer" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_beer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And if you want to try some beers brewed in traditional styles, they are out there. Here's a good list of some of the best: &lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beerstyles/traditional-ale/59/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.ratebeer.com/beerstyles/traditional-ale/59/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not only has variety improved, but so has the technology and agronomy of brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Malt variety, yield, and efficiency&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Crop science has increased the size of barley kernels and the amount of starches available to convert to sugar.  The common grain at the time was 6-row malt, today the most &lt;a href="http://www.homebrewersassociation.org/zymurgy/zymurgy-extra-2-row-vs-6-row-barley/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;common brewing barley is 2-row&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Understanding of the malting process has drastically improved. Today we understand how to &lt;a href="http://www.brewery.org/brewery/library/Malt.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;get perfectly malted barley&lt;/a&gt;. Historically the malt would have been over or under modified.  Under modified would have lots of unconverted starch which would leave a hazy beer that tasted rather bready. Over modified malt would would have no starch, but less sugar than possible so the resulting beer may lack body.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Kiln dryers allow for greater variety of malt. By controlling the heat cycle, the same variety of &lt;a href="http://hbd.org/brewery/library/Malt_AK0996.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;barley can make different malt&lt;/a&gt;.  Drying the grain in medieval times consisted of heating it over a fire.  Fire dried grains would have a smokey flavor that would be present in the beer.  The traditional Scottish Ale uses malt that has been dried over a fire where the fuel is peat, which is a very distinct smoke flavor.  The fire also was not nearly as exact or even as a modern kiln so some kernels would be burnt and other may be under cooked, so to speak. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Water&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Needless to say, but water purity is drastcally better today than in the 6th-15th centuries.  Because the brewing process boils the water, the beer was safer to drink than the water. Hence the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_of_Soissons" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;patron saint of brewers&lt;/a&gt; said "Drink beer, not water."&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Dissolved mineral content of water and pH control.  Medieval brewers had the water that they had.  Today, a brewer can start with distilled water and add whatever minerals they desire to change the flavor profile and pH of the mash.  The water pH can effect the mash efficiency and fermentation profile of the beer.  This lack of water control lead to specific styles coming from specific areas. I.E. Burton upon Trent is known for pale ales, Pilsen for golden pilsners, Munich for malty lagers.&lt;a href="http://howtobrew.com/book/section-3/understanding-the-mash-ph/balancing-the-malts-and-minerals" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Some water source mineral content.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Hops&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Ancient beers were not hoppy. Hops were not used extensively in beer until about the 12th century and were not cultivated en mass until about the &lt;a href="http://www.britishhops.org.uk/history-of-hops/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;13th century&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/a/4643/4637"&gt;Most beers older than that were bittered with Gruit.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The hops that were used were not high in bittering acids.  The oldest common hop varieties are the &lt;a href="http://beersmith.com/blog/2012/02/05/noble-hops-for-european-beer-styles/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Noble hops&lt;/a&gt;.  Just like today, costs of ingredients was a major factor in brewing.  Making a really hoppy beer was prohibitively expensive.  Just compare an English IPA brewed from old recipes vs. an American IPA.   &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Yeast and Microbiology&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;This is where modern technology really helps out.  Louis Pasteur discovered yeast in 1857. Up until that time, the changing of sugar into alcohol was considered magic or an act of god.  It was understood that the foam on top of a fermenting wort could be passed around to other vats of wort to start the process (&lt;a href="http://www.homebrewersassociation.org/how-to-brew/exploring-the-german-technique-of-krausening/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Krausening&lt;/a&gt;). Others would transfer &lt;a href="http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000103.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Magic Sticks&lt;/a&gt; from batch to batch to start fermentation.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;There are other microorganisms that can inhabit beer. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brettanomyces_bruxellensis" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Brettanomyces&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediococcus" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Pediococcus&lt;/a&gt; to name a few.  These can cause a sour, acidic flavor in beer.  Some ancient breweries would just let the cold night air in through an open window in order to cool the freshly boiled wort, exposing the warm sugar solution to whatever might land on it.  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Technology&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Thermometers - The temperature of the mash can affect the fermentabilty of the wort. The temperature of the malting and drying affect the sugar content of malted barley.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Chemical cleaners - All of the brewing equipment is sanitary. Modern living through chemistry.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Food storage/availability - I can get whatever ingredients I want, whenever I need them.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Refrigeration - I can cool the wort in controlled conditions. Beer can travel farther. I can ferment at optimal yeast temperature.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;More than can possibly be named...&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;h1&gt;The Result?&lt;/h1&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Ancient beers would be sweeter and thicker than today's thanks to less fermentable sugars in the wort due to inconsistencies in the brewing process, and inconsistencies in the malting process and poor yeast/microorganism control.  The alcohol content would be lower as well.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Ancient beers would not be hoppy.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Ancient beers would have to be drunk quickly before they spoiled.  The other bugs in the beer would turn the beer bad after a few weeks.  This also prevented the beer from traveling very from from the brewery.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Ancient beers could vary greatly, batch to batch.  The brewers of the times were very skilled with what they could work with, but they were constrained by what ingredients they could use, whether by law or availability.  Flavor can be affected by fermentation temperature, so a hot day in December could ruin my beer.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Ancient beers were dependent on the season. When was the grain harvested? When is it cool enough to ferment?&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Probably more information than you need, but hopefully it helps.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The beer judge certification program style guides seem to imply they are the same.  You can get more details at bjcp.org.  The text below is from the 2015 guidelines double IPA category, 22A.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Comments: A showcase for hops, yet remaining quite 
					drinkable. The adjective “double" is arbitrary and simply 
					implies a stronger version of an IPA; “imperial,” “extra,” 
					“extreme,” or any other variety of adjectives would be equally 
					valid, although the modern American market seems to have

					&lt;p&gt;A bit obvious, but it's just about more malt and hops (which results in higher ABV and IBU levels, off course).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Particularly, I don't see it becoming a new style, as our palate has a limit when it comes to tasting bitterness and even smelling hop oils. I think we have already reached this limit sometime ago when Imperial IPAs were conceived. So, anything beyond that seems like a silly obsession to me, and probably the best that one can get from a "triple IPA" is to come up with a good Imperial/Double IPA with (maybe) more alcohol, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;PS: Dogfish's 120 Minute IPA would be a quadruple IPA, then?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have been to two places that had beer blend (or beer "cocktail")  menus: Cafe Belge (now defunct I think), a small restaurant chain in Kent,  UK, and a pub in Montreal.  The former had hundreds of Belgian beers and one blend of note was Blackforest Gateau,  a mix of a chocolate beer and either Mort Subite cherry or Lindeman's Cherry Kriek. The latter place served their own microbrews, with a dash of something non-alcoholic. Mine was their regular ale (an IPA or golden ale)with whisky and maple syrup. A suitable mix to remind me of Canada. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If You do enjoy &lt;em&gt;Grimbergen Blanche&lt;/em&gt; You should definitely try out some &lt;strong&gt;Blanc 1664&lt;/strong&gt;. It is light white beer - cold one is best choice at hot summer! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for me, the one in the bottle is better (like all of the beers).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The taste of this beer is not suitable for everyone, some of my friends argues  with "how could you drink this ?". I really do love the rich fruit taste and the lightness of the beer itself. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you can purchase variety packs or cases of individual bottles where you live, that's a great way to explore -- get a couple each of a bunch of different things and use a site like &lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/"&gt;RateBeer&lt;/a&gt; to keep track of your opinions.  (I chose RateBeer because you can use it to assign a simple rating of 1-5 stars, which is good for a first approximation.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You should be aware of the different major styles of beers.  While you shouldn't dismiss an entire style based on one beer (maybe it was just that one that's not to your taste), if you find that you don't like most of the IPAs you taste or you tend to like most of the stouts, then you probably want to back off of the former and try more of the latter.  RateBeer (and also BeerAdvocate) shows the styles for individual beers, and you can search -- on those sites or in your store -- for more of those or similar styles.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you can only buy beer by the 6-pack -- do you have beer-drinking friends?  Get together with a couple other people, buy one 6-pack per person, and swap bottles around.  Where I live, until very recently, beer could only be sold in full cases, and I joined a group of people to buy mixed cases using this approach.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Figuring out the "right" beer can be very difficult. Something that helps tremendously is learning &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; gives the beer the flavors you like. "I really like that hint of banana in the Belgian beer! Awesome! That is a by-product of a specific type of yeast inherent to Belgian beers. Oh... Oh ::bleck:: that beer is like washing my tongue in bitter-water. Well, that beer might have a lot of hops added to it (or a hop that is known for having high alpha-acid levels).  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Look around locally. There is a craft beer store near me that has wine tastings on Fridays and beer tastings on Saturdays. Sometimes there are themes (I got to meet the creator of Duck-Rabbit!) and sometimes it is a hodgepodge of beers. You could also look up your local Homebrewer's Clubs. Homebrewers like talking about beer (especially their beer) and will often let you sample it to give them feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's a tough question. When I was getting into craft beer it was an organic process: I'd try something new, see if I liked it, then I'd try something else, and the process would continue. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Eventually my exploration became intentional: I wasn't that familiar with different styles, I just tried as many new beers as I could, and eventually found my niche. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, if I could do it all over again with some guidance I'd want to have some understanding of styles. In general you have your dark ales stouts/porters/imperials, your lights standard lager/pilsner, your pale ales, your wheat ales, some fruity beers, some spiced beers, and whatever I'm missing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So what you could do to start is do some research and find a good example of 4-5 different styles that interest you and that are available locally, and get an idea of which type of beer you like. After you figure out the type of beer you're interested in you could buy more examples of those styles and find which ones you like best.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A few notes that I'd keep in mind though:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Going from generic drinks to more 'complex' beers can be a challenge to the taste buds. At first try you might find some beers off putting, but after a while they grow on you. For that reason it'd also be smart to ease into beers with heavier flavour, until you're ready to approach them with an open mind and a palate that's used to new flavours. Try some balanced IPAs, wheat ales, some pilsners, maybe something sweet if you like first, go from there.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;I've always found the beer I drink changes with the seasos. What goes best in cold weather isn't the same thing that goes best in warm weather. So that could affect your judgement of what you try&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I will advice to you, firstly, to find right place, where you could buy &lt;strong&gt;beer on tap&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As you might know, preservatives are used in canned goods. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The same way beer on tap differ from 6 packs. Think what is better, a raw pineapple or canned pineapple.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The second advice is - &lt;strong&gt;don't mix&lt;/strong&gt; different beer. Never drink more than 3 different types of beer in one day. I have a dirty experience with it. 6 different bottles, only 3 liters, what can be easy? This was a black letter day in my life... Such huge hangover might be only after 1 litter of Vodka and 0.7 litter of rum after... Bad experience...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The third advice - &lt;strong&gt;a snack&lt;/strong&gt;. Use food as a major companion of your alco-trips...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;All of this three advices will safe you from hangovers and safe your health.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer is a bit like real estate. Location, location, location. Move to Czech Republic or Germany would be my number 1 recommendation and then try try try (in moderation of course). A very good indication is lack of supply. This most often means demand from other drinkers is high. For example it is over a month since I've been able to buy a crate of my local favourite  (Tegernseer Helles). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Love the Question! Here's some things I've done to try new beers, without breaking the bank: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Beer flights" are an easy way to start. Lots of pubs offer them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When your buddy orders a new beer say "hey, can I try that?" (Dump him if he says "no")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find a pub with a ton of beer on tap, and go check 'em out a night they run beer specials. Our pub has 120 on tap and Friday nights they are 1/2 price. Try something new. If you don't like it, give it away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many waiters/waitresses know their beers, ask them for a suggestion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find a "Self-Serve" beer pub. You can pour as much or as little as you want. Pay by the ounce. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throw yourself a beer tasting party. Everyone brings a six-pack. You each get to try a bunch of beers. You could use "Wine tasting cards", we used 1-5 point system on a white board. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You might start with the lighter beer categories like pilseners and ales. When you find a good one note the category. You like Jack &amp;amp; Coke huh, maybe try some of the "fruity" beers. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Typically, it seems people expect single, double and triple to mean higher alcohol content.  But that is not exactly true.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You have single and double bocks with the same alcohol content.  Take Weihensthephaner for example (a respected 1000-year old monastic brewery): Weihenstephaner Korbinian is a double with 7.4% ABV. Weihenstephaner Vitus is a single bock with a higher ABV of 7.7%.  In this case, the single has a higher ABV than the double.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;More grains and more sugar do not equal more alcohol.  The strain of yeast and temperature determine the survivability.  Some yeast can live at high alcohol levels.  You can feed them all the sugar and grains and they will still die and stop fermentation (producing alcohol) when the alcohol level 'limit' is reached.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The eisbock gets a higher ABV by freezing the beer and removing ice.  This removal of water is how the alcohol content is increased.  Again, most yeast cannot reach 12% (which one typically finds in an eisbock).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The single, double, triple label has to do with the strength of the beer overall, including nutrition (calories) and taste.  Remember, these 'doppels' were created for sustenance.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Careful with the word 'stronger' when talking about bocks.  It can mean more malty, darker, fuller, not just higher alcohol level.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are several ways to make a non-alcoholic beer (which BTW is not alcohol free. These beers can have .5% ABV). Boiling off the alcohol at 175f degrees, vacuum distillation at 120f degrees and reverse osmosis filters. They all take a toll on flavor and mouthfeel. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is a great &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-science-of-non-alcoholic-beer-509674407" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;article:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The most common way that alcohol is removed from beer is through heating. As we've discussed in several previous articles, alcohol has a much lower boiling point than water. At sea level, it's roughly 173 degrees F. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Then also: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;To minimize this, some operations practice vacuum distilling. Depending on the power of the vacuum, the alcohol's boiling point may be lowered as far as 120 degrees, which is much less disruptive to the flavors. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Then the last way:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"...beer is passed through a filter with pores so small that only alcohol and water (and a few volatile acids) can pass through. The alcohol is distilled out of the alcohol-water mix using conventional distillation methods, and the water and remaining acids are added back into the syrupy mixture of sugars and flavor compounds left on the other side of the filter. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The reason why hoppy and dark beers can't really be made this way:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;According to Brew Your Own, "The hop aromas will usually be driven off within the first five minutes, while the hop flavors will be gone within the first 15 minutes." This is why neither we nor any of our sources have encountered a half-decent non-alcoholic IPA, which is a damn shame, really.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To sum it up, light lager type beers have little color or flavor to begin with so it's easier for them to come through the process pretty close to what they were before they went in. Hoppy or dark beers would be stripped of so much flavor and color that they would be awful so nobody tries...&lt;/p&gt;
