					&lt;p&gt;Good question! I know that most (almost all) beers will not improve with age, and as you say will simply spoil. I don't know of any beers that you really want to age in the same way that you would age wine. In general, I would not age any beer unless it has specifically been presented to you by the brewer as something that should be aged.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Bottle fermentation or bottle-conditioning is adding yeast to the bottle at bottling time, so that the beer continues to ferment in the bottle. The main purpose of this is to carbonate the beer in the bottle, without injecting CO2 under pressure. I think most brewers do any conditioning before they sell their product, so you don't have to do this yourself unless you're homebrewing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's not clear to me why wine ages in the bottle, while whisky and beer don't. Any good answer would probably just confuse me anyway, with lots of mumbo-jumbo about tannins and stuff. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of considerations, although this is far from a complete answer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, a stronger (higher ABV) beer will tend to cellar better, as the alcohol can act to help prevent oxidization.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Second, a beer with less emphasis on hops, and more on malt, yeast, or other characteristics, will be a better candidate, because the qualities that hops impart will fade in a fairly short time.  This is why your IPAs and such should be consumed sooner than later -- the character is primarily in the hops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The purpose of cellaring a beer is to see its improvement over time.  Some may stay exactly the same, which others will change.  I think the answer there lies in whether there is still active yeast or bacteria in the bottle, and whether there is anything for them to chew on.  Some styles (lambics, for example) are far more prone to this, but I don't think there's a hard and fast rule that one couple follow.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Typically it depends on the style. High ABV beers, such as imperial stouts and barley wines will typically age well while others lower in ABV will go rancid after 3-6 months. Obviously you're not going to want to cellar a Bud Light (it tastes rancid anyway before storing it). But even when speaking of higher quality beers, you're not going to want to cellar witbeers, pale ales, and things of that nature which are rather light beers. It is usually best to ask the brewer if the beer is recommended for storing. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In terms of commercial beers, it is hard to say.  In general I find that aging tends to allow flavors to meld.  If I brew beer and do a brief aging in oak (or add oak chips), the beer usually &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; aging to achieve balance.  This is most typical with something I sometimes make called ebulon (non-carbonated, fermented malt and elderberries, secondary fermentation in oak for a month, then bottled and aged for several more months).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Extrapolating from my experience here, I would expect a few general rules to apply:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beers with disparate sharp contrasts (particularly where fruit are involved) may benefit from aging.  I could imagine things like full-bodied apricot ales aging well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher ABV and richer beers are likely to age better than lower ABV and lighter beers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is assuming you hope to see a general "smoothing over" of contrasts in an aged beer.  Some things will usually fade and some others may increase (for non-pasteurized or unfiltered beers, yeast flavors will usually increase).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there's not much one can do, at least using only household products.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While filling, using a counterpressure bottle filler would maximize the longevity of the beer as well as filling the beer while it's very cold, near its freezing point ~29 degrees F (so that its CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is maximally dissolved), if you have a choice in the matter (likely not).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Once opening the growler over multiple sessions, however, it's not the ineffectiveness of the seal (using a swing-top growler should do just fine) as much as it is the growing amounts of air that get sealed within.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Avoiding agitating the beer and reducing the temperature are the two key ways to slow down the rate of staling, but really once there's air in the beer it's just a matter of time before it goes bad.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Have you considered using a small CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; charger like this - &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HkV7w.jpg" alt="corny keg charger"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This uses small CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cartridges to push the beer. The advantage being that the keg won't stale quickly since very little air is introduced.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Because CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a significantly higher affinity for water (and therefore beer), than O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (the other major components in air) under normal keg conditions (pressure and temperature), I think it's worth a shot:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you take off the air pump and start charging it with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and then pump a good bit of beer/foam out of it (to rid it of some of the air), you should have a much nicer ratio of dissolved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to other gases. That plus keeping it chilled and not shaking it (just like you'd treat a can of beer) should help it last a good deal longer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;(This is assuming you've got a "ruined" keg on your hands. Obviously it's preferable to start out with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a few types of beers which are (generally) good to age.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strong Beers:&lt;/em&gt; like such as barleywines, robust porters, and imperial stouts. It is benefical if a beer is 8-10 percent or stronger, since an elevated alcohol profile will typically become smoother, mellower and more agreeable. That does not mean lower alcohol percentage beers can not be aged, but higer percentage beers are more suitable most of the time. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Malt:&lt;/em&gt; like Palo Santo and World Wide Stout. Darker, maltier beer is better because the sweet, residual sugars tend to soften over time. Even lower-alcohol beers with a malt-heavy profile will age better. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wild Beers:&lt;/em&gt; living organisms change the beer as it ages in the bottle. Orval Trappist Ale is a classic example. The Belgian pale ale receives a dose of Brettanomyces yeast as it goes in the bottle. The yeast can live in the bottle for years, slowly consuming sugars and protecting the beer’s existing flavors by consuming oxygen. Over time it goes from being bright and hoppy to bready, earthy and spicy. But sometimes they are unstable, because the yeast rapidly works through a beer and alters its character.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What not to age:&lt;/em&gt; IPA do not improve with age. Hoppy beers are not for aging.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It depends on how much sugar is present in the bottled beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the beer is bottle-conditioned, a small amount of sugar is added deliberately in order to carbonate the beer. Once the yeast have eaten all the sugar, they stop producing carbon dioxide and fall to the bottom of the bottle. This is not physiologically harmful in any way, but the beer might need to be poured carefully to avoid too much yeast in the glass.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;(If the beer is force-carbonated at the brewery, the yeast may contribute to the flavor of the beer, but does not produce any CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Harpoon's UFO appears to be bottle-conditioned, meaning the carbonation is produced naturally by the yeast. It's a hefeweizen, where the yeast character is actually desired - most people recommend to pour half the bottle, swirl it to suspend the remaining yeast, and then pour the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;(Now, home-brewed beer &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be harmful if too much sugar is added at bottling - the bottles can explode and cause injury. The &lt;em&gt;beer itself&lt;/em&gt; doesn't become harmful, though.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The yeast have most likely stopped fermenting by the time you get the bottle, considering it's probably at least a 5 days old by that point. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The yeast stop when the fermentable sugars have been consumed. This doesn't mean they consume all sugars in the beer, but rather just those that are fermentable. Most beer has both fermentable and unfermentable sugars. This ensures there is some body still to the beer from the unfermentable sugars when fermentation is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's unlikely even if kept warm that the yeast will produce more carbon dioxide or cause any harm to the beer - there is nothing available they can metabolize, so they floc to the bottom and go dormant.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can decant the beer between two large glasses or pitchers - the agitation will cause the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to come out of solution quickly and also not raise the temperature too much. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sample after 4-5 decants to see how much the carbonation has dropped, and repeat as necessary. You will end up with quite a bit of foam, hence the need for larger glasses or a pitcher.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;How long do you leave them in the fridge before you open them?  Making sure they've had a good several hours to chill may mitigate the explosion.  You could also try a homebrewer's trick, which is to chill them really cold, pop the caps all off then put new caps on.  You would need a &lt;a href="http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/brewing/brewing-equipment/bottling/bottle-cappers/red-baron-emily-capper.html"&gt;bottle capper&lt;/a&gt; to do this.  They're fairly cheap but you probably wouldn't have them unless you were or knew a homebrewer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, your best course of action may actually be to contact Hitachino.  Gushing bottles are often a sign of a wild yeast infection, so it's possible you may have just gotten some bad beer that got mishandled in shipping or something messed up on the bottling line and they missed it.  They may replace the pack or at least give you some other cool stuff to make up for the mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Over-carbonation is typically a sign of infection, which is certainly a possibility.  It's not a problem I've had with Hitachino, but at their price point I don't drink them often&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The chances of contamination at a Japanese brewery are very low.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Japanese tend to drink their beer much colder than craft beer drinkers in the United States - Think Coors cold.  We suggest placing the beer in the freezer for 3-5 minutes before opening the bottle, leaving it undisturbed and pouring it into an over-sized nonic glass. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hitachino's beers when stored and poured correctly are quite good, but buying them in the United States after a trans-pacific journey is both expensive and less tasty than on tap.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would suggest reading "Vintage Beer: A Taster's Guide to Brews That Improve over Time" by Patrick Dawson. To summarize his findings on what types of beers improve with age they must contain at least one of these three characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;High ABV (8% or more)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Sour&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Smoke&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that if a beer has two or more of these characteristics the odds of it improving with cellaring go up. But even if it has all three characteristics it may not improve with age, or only aging to a certain point.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Plus you must remember that proper aging is also required. Proper storage, temperature control, how the bottle is positioned while being stored, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally I was quite taken with 60, 90, and 120 minute IPAs (thank you DFH) when shelved in cool and dark places for as much as a year. My guess is it would have been good for longer, but tasty beer and curiosity got the best of my experiment. I think Wayne in Yak deserves an up vote I can't yet do thanks to my noob status. Well researched and void of conjectural inaccuracy. If hops were the only flavor in IPA then yes it could be decreasingly "hoppy" but that's assuming we're referring to the aroma hops. Your bittering hops would surely deepen with time. But with any beer there are more layers than one. High ABV beers will just broaden the chord change more as every flavor will carry different in the changing alcohol/water/sugar levels that time provides. Fruit in the beer no matter its place on the sweet/sour spectrum (notably normally high point as well) have similar success on the "cool dark" shelf. This is due to natural fermentation of organic matter  stored over time. Ever noticed how fresh salsa gets effervescent in your fridge? Granted there are no chunks of fruit (or tomatoes luckily) in your beer so the effects are severely lessened. They weigh in on the scale equal to the alcohol changes mentioned above. A personal favorite of mine is a Scotch Ale stored for as long as you can wait. Hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;TLDR&lt;/em&gt; answer&lt;/strong&gt;: Unfornately, no.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From my own experience, this varies a lot from company to company. It also depends on country's legislation or even the state, when it comes to USA. As far as I know, expiring dates for beers are even not obligatory by law in many american states.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Besides that, some breweries inform the bottling date, others the expiration date, which is less useful, because if you are a experienced drinker you know how old (or not) you want your beer to be, despite what the producer has estimated for it. So, in those cases, first you need to figure out the given shelf-life of it, and count backwards, to know when it was bottled. Pretty messy. I age beers and I'm quite used to it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, in general, when that information is not clear, your best (and maybe only) friend is the web - the brewery's website or forums.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For example, Anchor Brewery has a very particular (and weird) code standard for bottling date, but it is well explained on &lt;a href="http://www.anchorbrewing.com/brewery/faqs" rel="nofollow"&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The date code currently being used by Anchor Brewing Company (post-October 1991) replaces the clock-face that used to show the bottling month as one of 12 small notches around the main label. A three character code is now included on the new back label of the bottle. The code works like this:&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The first character is always numeric and represents the last digit of the year. The second character is always alpha and represents the month by using the first letter of the month unless that letter has already been used:&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;January: J, February: F, March: M, April: A, May: Y, June: U, July: L,  August: G, September: S, October: O, November: N, December: D&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The third character in the code is either alpha or numeric and tells the day of the month. The first 26 days are represented by the alphabet with the remaining days listed as:&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;27th through 29th = 7 through 9, 30th = 3, 31st = 1&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;An example of a date code would be: January 20, 2012 = 2JT&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not all breweries are so transparent like that, though. I have had a lot of trouble trying to figure out bottling date of some European beers, specially from some small, old breweries. Some american ones just won't tell anything about it as well, even on bottles.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;The Life of Wine (after opening)&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The short answer is approximately 3-5 days, but it all depends on the type of wine. There are a number of factors at play when it comes to the life of wine, after it has been opened.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These include acetic acid bacteria that consumes the alcohol in wine and metabolizes it into acetic acid and acetaldehyde. This causes the wine to have a sharp, vinegar-like smell.  Additionally, the alcohol can oxidize, causing a nutty, bruised fruit taste, that robs the wine of fresh, fruity flavors. These are both chemical reactions, and so the lower the temperature you keep a wine at, the slower this will happen.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Please see link for full reference and detailed breakdown of How long wine lasts after opening: &lt;a href="http://winefolly.com/tutorial/how-long-opened-wine-lasts/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://winefolly.com/tutorial/how-long-opened-wine-lasts/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I just went through four Hitachinos, and I can say for sure - they are solidly carbonated, but nothing I would call undrinkable. I've definitely had - and enjoyed - more carbonated beers. I've also had them before (bottle and poured at a bar) and never had the overcarbonation problem you describe.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Home brew here: I do German Hefeweitzen, or wheats. No preservatives. Did a dark one, went overboard on the dark malt, used 4 times as much as I should. Got something that tasted like a Guiness out of it. Not bad, but not what I was looking for in a dark German wheat. Put the bottles away in a dedicated fridge, a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Oh my god, the sugars built up! Just tried it for the first time tonight, to see if it was spoiled. I am now going to brew this one as my "one year old", as a special recipe. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can age a good, quality beer, at least under refrigeration. I am just learning about this. I am just consuming my one-year-old bottle of medium Hefe that I brewed last summer (my favorite recipe), and it is knocking a punch in terms of good flavors.&lt;/p&gt;
