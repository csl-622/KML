					&lt;p&gt;Way variable.  On the high end even from year to year the same vineyard and same grape will vary how long to hold. When it is released the vineyard and others will have a recommendation.  On the shelf at the liquor store is often ready to drink.  High end wine that is going to be put up is often bought out before it even hits the shelves.  Some wine that still needs to age does hit the shelfs.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wineries will typically hold some back to mature. Follow when they release it.  But that often goes to high end restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;

					  &lt;p&gt;Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and sweet wines like Moscato are best
					  served after 20 minutes after pulling from the refrigerator&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So keep the wine chilled and remove and let it stand before serving &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.seniorcitizensguide.com/articles/activities/wine-tips.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wine experts&lt;/a&gt; advise that white wines be served at 45 to 55 degrees Fahrenheit, light reds at about 60 degrees and more complex reds at "room temperature" or 65 to 70 degrees. [Remember, the phrase "room temperature" predates the days of central heat and air conditioning, so it generally refers to the "cellar" temperature of an earlier era.]&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Chilling helps preserve and highlight fresh, fruity flavors of varieties like Riesling, Pinot Gris and Gewürztraminer. Chardonnay, on the other hand, though white, is more complex, is fermented and aged in oak barrels and thus is usually served at the upper end of the 'white' scale.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Full-bodied Cabernets should be served in the 70 degree range. The warmer temperature allows the complexity of intense reds to come through as they are swirled, sipped and savored. Lighter reds like chambourcin or merlot are less complex, so are best appreciated just slightly chilled.
					Full-bodied Cabernets should be served in the 70 degree range. The warmer temperature allows the complexity of intense reds to come through as they are swirled, sipped and savored.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In planning a festive gathering, consider several ways to attain the "correct" wine temperature. Refrigeration will decrease a bottle's temperature 4 to 5 degrees each half hour in the first 60-90 minutes. After that, temperatures will drop 2-3 degrees per half hour. Riesling should be chilled for 4 or 5 hours, a chardonnay for 1-2 hours, merlot for an hour and cabernets for a half hour or less. If time is short, a freezer will drop the temperature about 6-8 degrees every fifteen minutes. However, it is best to set a kitchen timer in the event the party is so festive that you forget and find a broken bottle of very fine wine in your freezer the next morning."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wines.com/sweet-wines.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sweet Moscato&lt;/a&gt; and Moscato d'Asti wines are very good served chilled on their own as a refreshing summertime wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Allowing red wines to breathe for a short time allows the wine to oxidize, soften the flavors and release aromas. doing this is a proper wine glass is best.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.totalwine.com/wine-guide/decanting-wine"&gt;Allowing wine to breathe&lt;/a&gt; has the following information on this subject:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Allowing a wine to “breathe” is simply a process of exposing it to air for a period of time before serving. Exposing wine to air for a short time, or allowing it to oxidize, can help soften flavors and release aromas in a way similar to swirling the wine in your glass. Young red wines, especially those that are high in tannin, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, most Red Zinfandel, Bordeaux and many wines from the Rhône Valley, actually taste better with aeration because their tannins soften and the wine becomes less harsh. Another method of aerating a young, tannic red wine is to roughly decant it into another container, which exposes more of the wine's surface to air than simply removing the cork from the bottle. Uncorking a bottle and letting it sit undisturbed for period of time actually does very little to let the wine breathe as only a small percentage of the wine is in contact with air. A much better suggestion is aerating the wine in your glass or in a wine decanter. A decanter is defined as any vessel other than the original bottle that will hold the contents of the wine and allow for air to mix with the wine within. Usually, these are broad-bottomed glass or crystal containers. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Wine and air may have a negative effect on each other. To simplify, let us consider the following: &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;• Wine poured from a bottle into a glass and swirled is positive since the air mixture allows aromas to be displayed&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;• Wine that has had a brief exposure to air is positive since it allows wine to breathe similar to stretching its legs after being cooped up in the bottle for so many years. This exposure has a positive effect on the wine after 25 to 30 minutes. Intensely tannic or younger reds may need up to a few hours. In general, most red and white wines will improve within the first half hour of opening the bottle. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;• Extended exposure to air has a negative effect on the wine. After a day, the wine may obtain a vinegary smell or taste. Red wines and sweet white wines may last a little longer due to the natural preservatives of tannins and sugar. Refrigeration may be used to extend the life of white wine. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for butter  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Many white wines undergo a process that causes them to take on buttery flavors (which sometimes come across as buttered popcorn or even butterscotch).  That process is called malo-lactic fermentation, and here's the quick take on how it works.  Just after the grapes are made into wine, a special type of beneficial bacteria is added to the wine.  That bacteria converts one of the acids in wine (malic) to another type of acid (lactic).  The two acids feel different on the tongue.  Malic acid is very sharp (it's the acid in a Granny Smith apple); lactic acid is fairly soft (it's the acid in milk).  Most Chardonnay's go through malo-lactic fermentation and are therefore soft and buttery. (Taken from &lt;a href="http://www.blueskyvineyard.com/why-do-wines-taste-buttery" rel="nofollow"&gt;Why Do Wines Taste Buttery?).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As above, the exposure to air, or more precisely, oxygen in the air, gives rise to subtle changes in the aromatic composition of the wine due to oxidation. To do this in the bottle i. e. to simply uncork or unscrew the bottle and leave it is virtually pointless. The surface area of the wine exposed, coupled with the poor gas-liquid transfer means any change would in all likelihood, be undetectable. There would be more aeration occurring by the simple act of pouring the wine into a glass. The best method is to swirl the wine in a vessel. A wide decanter is best, but leave settling time (of solids) for older wines. A wide wineglass (where the glass is about the width of a bottle)  also works.  Ideally,  one would pour the wine into decanter where the volume of wine places the liquid level at the widest part of the vessel.  A good swirl maximises aeration /oxidation.  Give it time before pouring without the temperature rising too much above the ideal. Then, pouring from decanter to glass aerates further. This method is especially true for red wines. For white wines, more effective aeration is enacted by sucking the wine through the front teeth with air (almost slurping but only once the wine is in the front part of the mouth) while sipping from the glass.  For tannic reds, this method can leave a "furry"  feeling on the teeth however. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are several categories of organic compounds that are responsible for aromas - esters, ketones, and aldehydes are the most notable.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Esters are formed when an alcohol and an acid combine; creating esters is a common laboratory experiment in high-school chemistry - I remember making peppermint and banana.  This is the actual compound responsible for making peppermint smell like peppermint; the way we synthesized it in the lab isn't necessarily the way the peppermint plant makes it, but the result is identical.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A similar process happens during fermentation and aging of wine: the acids and alcohols present combine to form the compound that makes a cherry smell like a cherry, a thyme sprig smell like thyme, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Just to be clear, most fermented beverages are going to have some of these aroma compounds as byproducts of fermentation.  But grapes are notable in that they produce many more different acids than other fruits.  So the range of possible aroma compounds is greater in wine than in, for example, cider - since apples don't have the variety of acids that grapes do, and can't make as many different esters.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ken, as you requested in your response to my comment, I post this as an answer:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Despite not fulfilling the first criteria, I suggest considering St John's Commandaria, a sweet desert wine made in Cyprus from white grapes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From: &lt;a href="http://www.cyprusfoodndrinks.com/cgibin/hweb?-A=681&amp;amp;-V=authentics" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;A legendary wine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The Commandaria wine of today still bears the name of this area [Grande Commandaria, Limassol District], for the Knights of St John gave this name to the wine not only because it was produced in the villages that constituted the Order’s fief - the Commanderie - but also because knighthood was then held in high esteem among the Catholic countries of Western Europe and among pilgrims who, on their way to the Holy Land, stopped at Cypriot harbors for provisioning - which of course included the sweet Commandaria wine.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bsiW1.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bsiW1.jpg" alt="St John&amp;#39;s Commandaria"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The bottles are generally available for less than 20$ and bear what I believe is called the cross of St John. I have been lucky enough to have been introduced to its long history and the wine itself by a local enthusiast in Cyprus. I've also been impressed by its quality, which I consider outstanding for the price. It also would be an excellent sip after a good lunch or dinner, and as desert wine is typically drunk in smaller quantities than 'normal' red or white wine, the limited supply from a blessed bottle can be shared among more people.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes, I have the general simple rule you are looking for: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Price&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The cheaper a wine is (especially for Cabernet), the earler you should drink it. But there are some underlying explanations to explain why.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Cabernet Sauvignon is built for ageing. It has very thick skin, high levels of acidity, and low sugar content. For ageing, tannins are good, acidity is good, and too much alcohol can be bad. The sugar in Cabernet Sauvignon has an alcohol potential of about 12.5%, against 14.5% for Merlot. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Tannins and acidity need time to soften, that is why a normal Cabernet wine from a respectable winery should need 2-4 years before it can be appreaciated, and reach its peak in 5-10 years. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The lifespan is shorter for lighter wines, for example in vintages where it rained a lot, the wine can be diluted and age a lot quicker. In these conditions the bottle may reach its peak in less than 3 years. This is also true for industrial wines who do not want to take risks and do not wait long enough for the grapes to mature, giving very light wines. If you look at Bordeaux wines, a 2010 tastes younger than a 2013. Because 2010 was hot and 2013 was very wet.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Over the years, wineries have developed some techniques to push the ageing potential further:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the Vineyard&lt;/strong&gt;: Planting vines in higher density (going up to 10000 plants per hectare in the Medoc region), performing green harvests, using only old vines, to get more fruit concentration.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the Wine Cellar&lt;/strong&gt;: Some techniques are used to extract the grapes and concentrate the wine even more. Pre-fermentation cold maceration has become a popular practice for example. Or some more extreme things exist, like reverse osmosis, which is used in some top Bordeaux Chateaux to extract water out of the wine. The less water there is, and the more dry matter it has, the more ageing potentiel it gets.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the Ageing Cellar&lt;/strong&gt;: Top red wines all over the world are aged in new oak barrels during nearly 2 years. Oak adds new types of tannins and anti-oxydants to the wine. This increases ageing potential a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Cabernet Sauvignon is especially famous for its affinity for Oak. The Oak softens the Cabernet tannins while adding more of its own extra soft tannin flavours. This way the bottle can be opened earlier than expected but also age until later than expected !&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;All these techniques make the wine more complex, and enable it to age longer. These techniques also cost a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some great Cabernet Sauvignon from the Bordeaux region should only be opened starting from 20 years after bottling, but will need around 40-50 years for their most complex aromas to show.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So in the end you got to know the techniques and terroir quality of the vineyard who produced your bottle, and the quality of the vintage. But that is usually reflected in the price of the bottle anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Being a former winemaker, Cabernet can made in a variety of styles from cheap Trader Joes Cabernet ready to drink the day you buy it, to Napa Valley cabs that won't soften up for at least a decade. In fact, I've had 20 year old cabs that were still so tannic, I don't think they would ever soften up.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From a winemaking perspective, usually I found that wines taste flat for several months after bottling. I think the introduction of Oxygen (not necessarily a bad thing) at bottling time alters the wine for a while, but with age things start to level out. For a high quality cab, I would wait a year after bottling for things to come around and you can taste full flavors. BUT, that doesn't really mean the wine is ready to drink. Usually several years after bottling cabs start to soften their tannins and become much more approachable. Not everyone likes that though, many people like a younger fruitier wine. YMMV. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is for wine that is stored in a temperature controlled environment and not on your kitchen counter. Heat makes the process speed up but not necessarily in a good way. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are no hard and fast rules about when you drink a wine. I would error on the side of drinking sooner than later because it's possible to get vinegar or a corked wine the longer you wait. If you have several bottles of the same wine. Sample one every couple of years until you think they are ready. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;All wine that you want to age for a long time should be kept at the same temperature. The difference in temperatures come when you want to serve the wine. White should be served at a lower temperature than cellar temperature. Red wine, ideally, should be served at cellar temperature. What is the ideal cellar temperature? That is open to debate, but somewhere in the low 50s Fahrenheit (about 11-12 C). Humidity should be kept constant around 75% but there is no evidence you need to keep the humidity that high. You do not want to keep it at an excessively low humidity. You are trying to make sure the corks don't dry out which can cause wine leaking around the cork. You also want as little light and vibration as possible. Think of a cave as your ideal storage facility. You can read the Wikipedia article about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_of_wine" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wine Storage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Please allow me to recommend a nice red classic Italian wine called &lt;a href="http://www.gourmetsleuth.com/ingredients/detail/chianti" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Chianti&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From this &lt;a href="http://www.gourmetsleuth.com/features/wine-cheese-pairing-guide" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wine and Cheese Pairing Guide&lt;/a&gt; we can see that Chianti is paired well to the &lt;strong&gt;Pecorino Romano Cheese&lt;/strong&gt; and nuts. I know that you are using a &lt;em&gt;Columella's Caciofiore&lt;/em&gt; cheese that is "considered a sort of "ancestor" of the Roman pecorino cheese, prepared with rennet based on cardoon."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.parks.it/romanatura/Edettaglio_prodotto.php?id_prodotti=2078" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Columella's Caciofiore&lt;/a&gt; can be considered a sort of "ancestor" of the &lt;strong&gt;Roman Pecorino Cheese&lt;/strong&gt;, prepared with rennet based on cardoon. Columella talks about this cheese in his treatise "De Rustica": "It is better to curdle the milk with lamb or kid rennet, although it is also possible to curdle it with the cardoon flower or with safflower seeds or fig latex. Anyway, the best cheese is made with as less treatment as possible". (Lucio Giunio Moderato Columella, "De Rustica", 50 AD). Today, in the Roman Countryside, "native country" of the cardoon and the artichoke, some producers still use the cardoon flower as rennet and prepare raw milk pecorino cheese with an ancient taste. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Chianti red wine could be substituted with a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangiovese" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Sangiovese&lt;/a&gt; red wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the olives or spices are over powering the taste of your dish you may wish to use a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlot" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Merlot Wine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If it is a fortified wine you are after, would like to recommend a &lt;strong&gt;fortified Madeira Wine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Fortified wines, like port, sherry and Madeira, also go very well with rich cheeses. A classic match is English Stilton and port, but other blue cheeses also taste lovely alongside a glass of sweet, flavourful port. - &lt;a href="http://www.castellocheese.com/en/the-journal/2016/7/pairing-red-wine-with-cheese/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Pairing red wine with cheese&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The only answer would be an aged Madeira or Port. I think either would be an excellent accompaniment to the foods are your choosing. Make sure they are fairly old. 10+ years old at least. The older the better...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Best wine I ever had was a 1780s Madeira. Each bottle alone was over $10,000 and a glass at the restaurant was $1000. I know the restaurant owner and he let me have a taste. It was sublime! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a safe bet, dry still red wines should be served between 18-20°C
					Of course exceptions apply... &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Opening time prior to service depends on the vintage, older wines (4+ years) need to breathe longer than young wines (0-3 years).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Knowing what kind of wine you have would help, denomination and vintage being the most useful information.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;An excellent practice is also read the wine back label. In some cases there is information about the "serving temprature" and also this maybe can be found on the winnery webpage. Some wineries web site are in their local language as well as English.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most fortified wines such as port, Madeira, (sweet) sherry, Commandaria are both very sweet and are very high in alcohol. Many are in the range of 20% ABV. I would strongly [pun intended] suggest seeing if she enjoys Port or Madeira. My personal favourite strong, sweet wine is &lt;a href="https://www.majestic.co.uk/Elysium-Black-Muscat-zid18224" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Elysium Black muscat&lt;/a&gt;. It is so sweet that I commonly have it as dessert in restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It depends on how sweet you are looking for. If you are looking for very sweet than dessert wines are the way to go, a &lt;strong&gt;Sauternes&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Mustacel&lt;/strong&gt; will be at least 12% if not higher. If all you want is a fruitier wine then many German white wines like &lt;strong&gt;Rieslings&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Gewürztraminers&lt;/strong&gt; tend to be on the sweet side, sometimes too sweet for many palates. Slightly less sweet whites are &lt;strong&gt;Sauvignon Blancs, Chenin blancs&lt;/strong&gt;, soaves, the list goes on. All of these should be above 12%&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Reds are tough for people with sweet palates, there are red dessert wines out there, and there are sweeter reds but there's no variety I can think of that is reliably sweeter. Roses are often sweet, especially the cheaper ones like &lt;strong&gt;White Zinfandel&lt;/strong&gt;, but those can be low quality. A good &lt;strong&gt;Zinfandel&lt;/strong&gt; red is a great wine, but not what I'd consider sweet. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A little primer on alcohol and sugar in wine. The lower the alcohol is usually associated with higher acid levels because the grapes are picked less ripe. Champagne is a good example of this. To offset the biting acids, winemakers usually add sugar to compensate. That's why so many low alcohol wines are sweet. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Can you find higher alcohol wines that are sweeter? Sure, dessert wines come to mind. Sauternes, Ice Wines, Tokay, Late Harvest wines are sweet with more alcohol. A lot of mainstream wine brands, like Sutter Home are purposely made sweeter. Unfortunately, the cheaper the wine, usually the sweeter it is. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Like I always mention here, wine is an adventure that only you can travel. You need to discover what you like (or your wife in this case). But I think these are several recommendations that should set you on the path.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Please consider the sweet and fortified wines of the Rhone with &lt;em&gt;Muscat de Beaumes de Venise&lt;/em&gt; being the kind of wine that might give satisfaction allround. I find that the great house of E. Guigal offers an excellent price/quality/ratio for this wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My favourite wine varietal these days is Portguese Vinho Verde which is a super-sweet white wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Two major brands are Sogrape Gazela Vinho Verde at 9% ABV, sugar content 11g/L or Caves Alianca Vinicola De Sangalhos Vinho Verde which is actually 10% ABV, sugar content 14g/L&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's perfectly fine to leave a bottle of red wine in the fridge if you can't finish it that day. In fact that is the best way to preserve an open bottle if you have no other way. You can extend the life of an opened bottle of red wine by a couple of days by sticking it in the fridge. Room temperature red wine starts to get funky around day 3 while in a fridge it might be 5 or 6 days. It really depends on the wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The only problem, unless you like cold red wine (if you've ever been to Paris, you know that's how they serve it), you will need to let it sit out in a glass until it warms up. Make sure you put a cork or some other stopper back in the top of the bottle to slow down the rate of oxidation. Personally, I like my red wine served at cellar temperature (around 50f). I think it makes the red wine easier to drink. Nobody likes hot red wine unless you are making Gluhwein. &lt;/p&gt;

					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.colgate.com/en/us/oc/oral-health/cosmetic-dentistry/teeth-whitening/article/how-to-avoid-red-wine-teeth-this-holiday-season-1215" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Why Red Wine Stains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Strong pigments in red wine are instant stain-makers for porous surfaces like your teeth. These pigments, called chromogens, give it that deep, intense hue, and leave their mark on your teeth after just a few sips. The nature of enamel plays a big part in this process.
					  "Enamel isn't perfectly smooth," says Benjamin Rudow, D.D.S. "It has small cracks and irregularities, and pigmentation from red wine will settle in them&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So you need to seek out wines that have the highest amount of tannins possible. Your run of the mill grocery store wines will not have a lot of tannins because it's more work and that makes the wines more expensive. Wines meant to age a long time will usually have more tannins since they help buffer the effects of oxidation and help the wine last longer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, really you want expensive, long lived, tannic wines. Those would be Cabernet, Petit Sirah, Tempranillo, Nebbiolo. But if you really want to go full stain, try a Tannat wine. It will stain your lips, gums, teeth and tongue! It's hard to find a 100% Tannat, but there are some that make it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tablascreek.com/wine/298/2014_Tannat" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Tablas Creek&lt;/a&gt; in California makes a 100% Tannat that I've had before and it will stain like nobody's business! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, wine considered dry is allowed to have 9 gr (european unit) of sugar per Liter (european unit). 
					THE ONE cab. you are looking for is most possibly at the end of that range.
					Simply look for Cab. which is not so high in alcohol maybe 12%, not 13,5-15%.&lt;/p&gt;

Overall it looks like it leans toward port-ish, so is probably fine for a week at least.  And if you end up thinking it is starting to degrade from oxygenation, once it's open you can throw the bottle into the freezer as you would to preserve any open wine.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Glühwein is part of a larger category of heated and spiced wines called Mulled Wines. They are popular all over Europe and go by more names than I can cite here.

					&lt;p&gt;Sweden - and by extension Scandinavia - has Glögg, which is also a mulled wine, albeit more often spiced with cloves, cinnamon and the like compared to the Glühwein I've tasted.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In addition, one may add a shot (Schuss) of brandy to Glühwein, whereas Glögg most often already contains additional alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Within the Catholic Church and traverse many international borders mulled wine is a favourite drink in many a Catholic homes on the &lt;strong&gt;Feast of the Apostle St. John (December 27).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Of Course mulled wine is a very popular tradition on this day and throughout the Christmas season.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;St. John the Apostle, is the disciple "whom Jesus loved". It is a custom in the old countries to drink of "St. John's Love". The Church provided a special blessing of wine in honour of the Saint. According to legend St. John drank a glass of poisoned wine without suffering harm because he had blessed it before he drank. The wine is also a symbol of the great love of Christ that filled St. John's heart with loyalty, courage and enthusiasm for his Master; he alone of all the apostles was not afraid to stay close to Our Lord during the Passion and Crucifixion. - &lt;a href="https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/prayers/view.cfm?id=965" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;St. John's Wine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Nowadays the faithful drink mulled wine (Glühwein) on the Feast of St. John. Many different cultures still take part in this tradition.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;This hot mulled wine can be served on St. John's feast day. On St. John's Day, the Roman Ritual tells us that "wine offered by the faithful is blessed in remembrance and in honour of St. John who without any ill effects drank a cup of poisoned wine." It was by faith that St. John was saved, and through the mystical union became the disciple whom the Lord loved best. By love and faith man comes to God. We, too, pray as members of the mystical body. - &lt;a href="https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/recipes/view.cfm?id=193" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;St. John's Wine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Then there is the Nordic Glögg mulled wine tradition which is served on &lt;strong&gt;St. Lucy's Day (December 13)&lt;/strong&gt; in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Glögg, gløgg, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gl%C3%B6gi" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;glögi&lt;/a&gt; and similar words are the terms used for mulled wine in the Nordic countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;In Sweden, ginger bread and lussebullar (also called lussekatter), a type of sweet bun with saffron and raisins, are typically served on December 13 to celebrate &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucy%27s_Day" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Saint Lucia's Day&lt;/a&gt;. It is also traditionally served at the julbord, the Christmas version of the classic, Swedish buffet smörgåsbord. In Denmark, gløgg pairings typically include æbleskiver sprinkled with powdered sugar and accompanied with strawberry marmalade. In Norway, gløgg is paired with rice pudding (Norwegian: riskrem). In such cases, the word graut-/grøtfest is more precise, taking the name from the rice pudding which is served as a course. Typically, gløgg is drunk before eating the rice pudding, which is often served with cold, red cordial (saus). - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulled_wine" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Mulled Wine (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Many European countries including Germany celebrate &lt;strong&gt;Silvesterabend (New Yerar's Eve)&lt;/strong&gt; with mulled wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Austria, and its neighbour to the north, Germany, call New Year's Eve Silvesterabend, or the eve of Saint Sylvester. Austrian revelers drink a red wine punch with cinnamon and spices, eat suckling pig for dinner and decorate the table with little pigs made of marzipan, called Marzipanschwein. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/new-years-food-traditions/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;New Year's food traditions around the world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The last day of the year is called "Sylvester" in Europe. This word is derived from the liturgical feast, celebrated on December 31, of St. Sylvester, pope and confessor, who died in the fourth century.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The end of the old and the beginning of the new year was, and still is, observed with popular devotional exercises. Special services are held in many churches on New Year's Eve to thank God for all His favours in the past year and to implore His blessings for the new one.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;A distinctive feature of the traditional celebration is the feasting and merrymaking during the night, often combined with masquerades, singing, and noisemaking. This is a relic of the pre-Christian reveling in ancient Rome; its original significance was to salute the New Year and to drive the demons away.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The main item of Sylvester drinking is the punch bowl. Today we have quite a variety of punches. The modern form of punch originated in England in the early seventeenth century. It consists of alcohol, water, spice, sugar, fruit essence. The word seems to be an abbreviation of "puncheon," which was the name of the cask from which grog used to be served on English ships. - &lt;a href="https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/recipes/view.cfm?id=926" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Mulled Wine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In Russia we call it глинтвейн (glintveyn), and I believe the central ingredient is a melted sugar. Maybe not so much for the taste, but for the magic. It is important for the entire party to watch its making.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sorry could not resist, here is how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of time make a strong sirup and let it recrystallize in a cylindric mold, about 1" thick, and as long as your saucepan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put wine and spices into the saucepan and bring to a slow heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soak sugar cylinder in brandy and arrange it above the wine (you'd need some metal frame to hold it).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the magic: set it on fire, and watch the sugar melting and dropping into the heated wine. Keep pouring brandy over sugar as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The process is not easy, but once you've mastered it, your success at the party is guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;We also drink it in the Czech Republic. We call this "svařák" or the "svařené víno".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bluedanubewine.com/winery/kindzmarauli/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Kindzmarauli&lt;/a&gt; is a region in Georgia that is well known for their wines. There is also seems to be some confusion about if it's a style of wine or not. Wikipedia claims that it's a sweetish red wine made from Saperavi grapes and other sources say it's just the appellation and several grapes can be used. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saperavi" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Saperavi&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teinturier" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;teinturier&lt;/a&gt; grape which means it has both red skin and flesh. Most red grapes only have red skin and clear flesh. They can be very powerfully colored and are many times used to color wines that need a little help in the color department. A well known teinturier in California is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicante_Bouschet" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Alicante Bouschet&lt;/a&gt; which at one time was one of the most grown grapes in California. I suspect if you could track down a off dry California Alicante Bouschet it would have a similar flavor profile. There are Saperavi grapes in California, but I don't know a winery using them.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Or you can just buy the real thing from Georgia at your &lt;a href="https://www.totalwine.com/wine/red-wine/saperavi/teliani-valley-kindzmarauli/p/38446750?s=505" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Total Wine&lt;/a&gt; store in California.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Red wines generally benefit from aging. In the right conditions, dark and cool, tannins can smooth out removing some of their bite. Flavors can mellow and blend into something very interesting to the palette.  Whites usually can follow suit, but their life span sans a few specific varieties, usually aren’t meant for aging and should be drunk young.  IMO few wines are really geared for long aging, notably ports, with their high alcohol levels age well into several decades, giving the drinker unique flavors as the years go by.  However, if a wine is flawed at conception, aging won’t make a purse out of a sow’s ear.&lt;/p&gt;
