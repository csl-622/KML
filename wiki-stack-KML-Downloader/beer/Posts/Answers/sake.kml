					&lt;p&gt;Take a look at this article: &lt;a href="http://vinepair.com/wine-blog/where-the-hell-the-sake-bomb-came-from-a-lesson-in-irony/" rel="nofollow"&gt;WHERE THE HELL THE SAKE BOMB CAME FROM: A LESSON IN IRONY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From the article:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;A few sources suggest that sake bombs were actually invented by American soldiers occupying Japan in the years following World War II.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The "sources" mentioned are this additional article at Los Angeles Magazine: &lt;a href="http://www.lamag.com/digestblog/an-ode-to-the-sake-bomb/" rel="nofollow"&gt;An Ode to the Sake Bomb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From the Wikipedia page (bolded for emphasis):&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Sake (Japanese: 酒, IPA: /ˈsɑːkɛ/ SAH-keh), also spelled saké, (IPA:
					  /ˈsɑːkeɪ/ SAH-kay or American English /ˈsɑːki/ SAH-kee)[1][2] also
					  referred to as a Japanese rice wine, is made by fermenting rice that
					  has been polished to remove the bran. Unlike wine, in which alcohol is
					  produced by fermenting sugar that is naturally present in fruit,
					  typically grapes, sake is produced by a brewing process more akin to
					  that of beer, where starch is converted into sugars which ferment into
					  alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The brewing process for sake differs from the process for beer in
					  that, for beer, the conversion from starch to sugar and from sugar to
					  alcohol occurs in two distinct steps. Like other rice wines, when sake
					  is brewed, these conversions occur simultaneously. Furthermore, the
					  alcohol content differs between sake, wine, and beer. Wine generally
					  contains 9%–16% ABV,[3] while most beer contains 3%–9%, and undiluted
					  sake contains 18%–20% (although this is often lowered to about 15% by
					  diluting with water prior to bottling).&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;In the Japanese language, the word "sake" (酒, "liquor", also
					  pronounced shu) can refer to any alcoholic drink, &lt;strong&gt;while the beverage
					  called "sake" in English is usually termed nihonshu (日本酒, "Japanese
					  liquor")&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Under Japanese liquor laws, sake is labelled with the word
					  seishu (清酒, "clear liquor&lt;/strong&gt;"), a synonym less commonly used in
					  conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The bolded would suggest that etymologically and legally it would be classified as a liquor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What this says to me is that a) it's culture of origin perceived it to be a spirit, and b) so did those who wished to regulate it's use.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short Answer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					Sake is categorized as sake, and should not be grouped together with other types of liquor. In Japan, you need a license specifically for making sake, even if you have licenses for making beer, wine and spirits!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long Answer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					To help clarify, let's compare the different liquor types.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is sake a spirit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					  No. Sake is brewed. By this definition alone, it disqualifies itself to be classified as a spirit, which are distilled. Shochu (焼酎) would be a closer Japanese counterpart there.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is sake a wine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					  No. Sake uses a complex fermentation process known as a parallel multiple fermentation, where the rice is converted from start to glucose, then glucose to alcohol simultaneously in the same container. Wine uses the glucose from the grapes, making it a simpler process single fermentation process.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is sake a beer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					  No. While beer is like sake in the fact that it must first convert starch into glucose, this is done in two separate steps, making it a serial multiple fermentation process. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;By comparing the processes of making the different liquors, we can see that sake does not fall under spirits, wine, or beer. It is somewhere in between wine and beer in terms of process.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it often referred to as a wine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					I do not have the definitive answer, as there is no source that tells me the story behind that. But I can point the similarities between the two liquor types.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;1) Alcohol content is similar.&lt;br&gt;
					  A rough average for red and white wines combined is about 13-14%. It's about 15-16% for sake. Spirits like whisky are at 40%, so sake is nowhere near there.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;2) They are both highly dependent on ingredients (location).&lt;br&gt;
					  For wine, it's the terroir, and for sake, it's the water. This makes the location of both liquors' makers an important factor to the flavors.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;3) Taste-wise they are close to each other.&lt;br&gt;
					  Especially white wine. Sake can also have sweet, fruity tastes.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;4) The way of drinking is similar.&lt;br&gt;
					  When you drink a good wine, you let it roll on your tongue a little, try to find the different flavors. The same goes with sake (God forbid you'd just chug it down like a shot of bad tequila!).&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;5) They way they are sold are similar.&lt;br&gt;
					  You don't buy 6-packs of sake, but a large sake bottle, similar to (but usually wider than) wine bottles. There are of course small one-cup sizes, and carton sake (similar to box wine), but the main method of purchase has always been the large bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;6) In the US, it's branded as a wine.&lt;br&gt;
					  It certainly isn't beer, but if it gets grouped into spirits, sake would be harder to sell in the States, as it would require a separate liquor license to sell it. By counting it as a "wine", stores only need a beer/wine license to sell.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the end, I feel like wine is "similar enough" to most people to use as a comparison. I said that sake is sake, but really phrasing it like that doesn't help explain things to people. Having something familiar to compare to makes it easy, though I do wish people didn't stop at "sake equals wine", since that isn't an accurate explanation either.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here are few sites I referenced when looking into the details:&lt;br&gt;
					&lt;a href="https://www.nta.go.jp/shiraberu/senmonjoho/sake/qa/01/01.pdf" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Documents from the Japanese National Tax Agency regarding liquor types (JP).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					&lt;a href="http://www.homare.biz/knowledge-of-sake/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Homare sake maker website, describing the process of sake-making (JP)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					&lt;a href="http://experiencesake.com/sake-rice-wine-939" rel="noreferrer"&gt;A small article on the similarities of sake and wine (EN)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					&lt;a href="http://www.oenon.jp/product/sake/process/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Oenon, another sake maker. Has pics of the sake-making process (JP)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Due its high alcohol content, you will still be able to drink the sake without worrying about your health.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, the recommended consumption period is usually one year after bottling. After that, the maker cannot guarantee the flavor of the sake. Whatever the flavor of your sake is right now, whether it aged well or went plain ugly, is not the flavor of the sake as advertised by the sake maker. Oh, and if the bottle is open, like wine, sake will oxidize rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sake may or may not age well, depending on the sake. I don't have enough knowledge to say what those differences are, though from my experience, old sake can become either a tad acidic or more rich in its original flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You may be able to sell the bottle so someone interested, but I don't think there is a giant market for it outside of Japan (though I may be wrong about that). In Japan, there would be plenty demand for old sake there.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;By law, there should be a date on the bottle (not sure if they print that on the box) which indicates the "month of bottling". Although, that law may not have existed 50 years back...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Note there is a chance it will go bad in the case it is nama (fresh) sake, which you can tell if you see 生 somewhere on the label. Nama sake is sake that does not undergo the two pasteurization processes after being made, so the yeast is still alive. Taste guarantee is only about a half a year, and something 50 years old will probably taste yogurty or cheesy.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's safe to drink. I don't think you want to drink it or cook with it. The rule of thumb if it tastes bad, why would you cook with it? The chances that it actually tastes good at this point are about zero. You could do a taste test if you really want, but it won't hurt you (unless you drink too much and then you'll get a hangover)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Split it into small aluminum containers and store it in the fridge. Fill it to the top so there is very little air in the container.  You can find kid sized 12 oz water bottles on sell for just a few bucks.  It should last weeks but best used in one week.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is also suction pumps and nitrogen.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Temperature for drinking is personal taste.&lt;/p&gt;
