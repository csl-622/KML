					&lt;p&gt;Citra is a registered trademark since 2007. Citra Brand hops have fairly high alpha acids and total oil contents with a low percentage of cohumulone content and  imparts interesting citrus and tropical fruit characters to beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For more information, you can read the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hop_varieties#Citra_brand_HBC_394_cv"&gt;Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt; on the Citra brand.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Dry hopping is a brewing technique which specifies &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; hops are added to a beer.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In particular, "normal" hopping is when you add hops while boiling the wort.  Depending on how much time you are into the boil, this may add more bitterness or more aroma.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Dry hopping, on the other hand, is when you add hops &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the boil is done, usually in a fermentation chamber.  The purpose is only to add more aroma to a beer.  You aren't getting the oils from the hops, so the beer shouldn't be any more bitter than before.  Because no bitterness is added, you won't find a beer that is strictly dry-hopped -- the bitterness of the hops is what cuts the sweetness of the wort.  Dry hopping is an extra twist that some brewers use.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;All that said, is there a way to tell whether a beer is dry-hopped or just extra hoppy?  That's hard to say, since you certainly can add more hops late in the boil to get more aroma qualities from them.  Probably your best bet is to ask the brewer, and if you really like the beer, get a second pint!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sort of.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hop_varieties" rel="nofollow"&gt;literally dozens of different varieties of hops,&lt;/a&gt; in much the same way there are dozens of different breeds of dogs. Just as a Chihuaua and a Great Dane are both &lt;em&gt;Canis Lupus&lt;/em&gt;, a Galena Hop and a Goldings Hop are bot &lt;em&gt;Humulus Lupulus&lt;/em&gt;, separated by vastly different lineages and genetics. New hop varieties are often developed by selective crossbreeding of existing variants, to generate different flavor profiles by adjusting the acidity and oil content of the hop.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Like different breeds of dogs, different hop varieties are often the products of hundreds of years of genetic development in a particular climate -  the Pacific Northwest, especially the Yakima Valley and Cascade Mountains in Washington, Oregon and Idaho, is known for it's production of very strong, highly acidic hops that impart a very strong bitter flavor - take a sip of a Sierra Nevada IPA and you'll instantly recognize that classic blend of the 'three C's'.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;By contrast, traditional hops grown in England and on the European continent tend to be more mellow and aromatic - especially the so called 'noble hops' popular in many less bitter tasting German and Czech beers. Still others, like Japans Sorachi Ace, offer a more citrus bite to the beer they're added to. While these differences are not &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; a product of climate, it's doubtless true that climate has had an impact on the development of variation amongst the various hop lines that have been bred through the centuries -  and especially over the past 50 years or so.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Put another way: New World vs. Old World Hops is a meaningful distinction, but it has less to do with climate and more to do with the difference in cultivation practices and the specific varietals popular with farmers in various regions. Growing conditions may have some impact, but the specific lineage matters &lt;em&gt;much, much more&lt;/em&gt;. The fact that those lineages tend to have significant geographic commonalities is as much an accident of history as it is of varying conditions, but it's nonetheless sufficiently meaningful that, in particular referring to hops from the Pacific Northwest evokes a very specific and comprehensible flavor profile in most educated beer drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hops#Other_uses"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, hops can be used in other beverages.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The only major commercial use for hops is in beer, although hops are also an ingredient in Julmust, a carbonated beverage similar to soda that is popular in Sweden during December, as well as Malta, a Latin American soft drink. Hops are sometimes added to some varieties of kvass. They are also used for flavor in some tisanes.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hops are also used medicinally. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Hops are also used in herbal medicine in a way similar to valerian, as a treatment for anxiety, restlessness, and insomnia.  &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Hops are of interest for hormone replacement therapy, and are used in preparations for relief of menstruation-related problems.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In answer to part of your question, there are probably no other reasons for large-scale cultivation of hops in the 8th century other than for brewing.  While hops were used in medicine, the major national herbals of Anglo-Saxon England don't mention them.  That we have strong references in early 8th century England (see "Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink" by Ann Hagen) to comparatively large-scale cultivation of hops strongly suggests they were used in brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hops are used in medicine as well, but the amounts used there are very small in comparison to those used for brewing, and the two major Anglo-Saxon national herbals, Bald's Leechbook and The Lacnunga don't mention them (I think the Old English Herbarium does, but it is a translation into Old English of a continental Latin work).  Keep in mind most of my work with these has been in translation (Pollington's) and translating plants from the descriptions often poses interesting issues.  I could probably find standarized editions in Old English if needed however.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting connections here is that two of the most important early brewing herbs, hops and henbane, both had strong connections to female medical concerns (this is also interesting because historically brewing was women's work, hence the obsolete term "alewife" not referring to a fish--- the woman's place in keeping a tavern was privileged but brewing was sort of like cooking, something every woman was supposed to know).  Hops to heavy periods, and henbane was used to address pain in childbirth.  Both of these may contribute to Bald's warning that pregnant women may drink ale safely but not beer, for beer would cause a risk of miscarriage.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In general for hops to be grown to an extent noteworthy, one is almost certainly talking about brewing, whether grains or honey, and whether alone or with other herbs.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As the old saying goes, "There's no accounting for taste."   So, objectively, no, there is no such thing as too hoppy as long as some enjoy them.   There certainly are beers that are so bitter that they have very limited appeal and that can completely drown out other flavors rending not only the beer itself a one-note show, but eliminates the taste from anything else you eat or drink in close proximity.   Stone's Ruination is an example of this.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, while many aren't drawn to the "hop-bombs" that seem to get bigger and bigger all the time, the fact that there's a market to support them would indicate that they are not, in fact, "too hoppy." &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.brewersfriend.com/2009/01/24/beer-styles-ibu-chart-graph-bitterness-range/"&gt;International bittering units (IBU)&lt;/a&gt; measure the bitterness of different beer styles. IPAs have a wide range, and they're typically higher on the scale. If you can find the IBU of a beer you want to try (on Untappd, on the bottle, or some bars make this information available), you can compare it to other beers that you like to determine if it might be too bitter for your tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've tasted some beers that are way off the IBU scale that I linked to, but it's still subjective to say that these beers are "too hoppy." It's a matter of taste that I'd compare to saying that some foods are "too spicy." Some people might just like to try these novelty beers once, and other people might really develop a taste for them.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I feel like this is a pretty opinion based question, especially with IPAs being so "in" right now.  Ignoring the taste of hoppiness, which is different from bitterness (dear Bob that myth needs to die), there's a limit to how much bitterness we humans can actually perceive.  Past about 100 IBUs the tongue straight up can't tell that there are any more.  Now we perceive the quality of bitterness differently.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So bitterness in beer is provided primarily by adding hops and boiling them for a long time.  The length of time and pH of the wort affects a chemical reaction called "Isomerization", which is the process by which Alpha Acids in hop oils become Iso-Alpha Acids which stay stably in solution and make beer taste bitter.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Similarly, there are also Beta Acids.  Generally these are in 1:1 ratio with the Alpha acids but sometimes there are more or less depending on the hop types.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beta Acids are chemically Lupulones and Alpha Acids are Humulones.  We've identified 3 types of each as well: No prefix, Co-, and Ad-.  Most homebrewing hop packets list total alpha acid %, then % of those acids that are Cohumulone.  But straight IBUs don't take which acids were used to get to that number.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Humulone is thought to give the best, smoothest, most pleasing bitterness.  Cohumulone can be pretty abrasive, and the bitterness may seem rougher or more astringent...or just more bitter, even at the same IBUs.  Beta acids are also thought of as a "rough" bitterness, but they primarily produce bitterness via oxidation and can help long term shelf-stability.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I don't know what all this really helps to answer, but I guess the main points are that you can't taste past 100 IBUs, but there are qualities to bitterness that can make some beers more abusive than others.  Also my final point is that hop flavor and aroma don't make a beer bitter.  If the hops have been boiled enough to actually make a beer that bitter...you do not taste those hops.  You can have hoppy beers that are smooth and not bitter at all by hop selection, yeast selection, dry hopping, and not boiling them hops very much.  You can also make beer more bitter by yeast selection and certain grains.  You can also make Ruination or Palate Wrecker, but the point is that hoppiness and bitterness are not the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In terms of bitterness vs hoppiness, with the 3 stages in the process where hops are generally added, only the final stage gives distinct hoppiness (as opposed to bitterness) as the hops aren't in the mix long enough for heat to break down the oils and flavour.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The reason why there are so many types of hops used, in varying concentrations, at various stages throughout beer making is because &lt;strong&gt;people are different&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;I love a hoppy beer. Hoppier the better (at least in the summer months)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;My wife hates them.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So really, the answer to your question is &lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt; - some beers aren't too hoppy; they are just too hoppy for you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, there is no such thing as too hoppy. Beers like Heady Topper have an incredible amount of hops, yet are highly drinkable.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, some beers have a poor malt/hops balance, and as as result have an overbearing hope profile. These beers smell and taste like grass, and are not very drinkable.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The answer is subjective. A lot of people are referring to IBUs in their answers. IBUs are a weak approximation, they only give you an idea. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Try the beer yourself! I for one love bitterness and believe brewers should always push the limit of any flavor in pursuit of exciting, tasty beer. Yet as with anything it is a matter of balance. Some flavors compliment each other, some do not. Learn what you like, share. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As more and more companies/breweries enter the craft beer market I think this is one of the most obvious ways they see to differentiate themselves, therefore I believe the beers you see that are solely for the purpose of being very hoppy and/or bitter are for marketing purposes. It would be akin to different hot sauce companies attempting to gain fame by making the hottest sauce, not necessarily the one that best complements food. In either case the consumer will have a memorable experience and will remember the name and possibly tell a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The answer is no, there is not an objective measurement of "too hoppy". It is entirely preferential. You could however state that a beer is too hoppy to match a given style, for example a Berliner Weisse with a bitterness of 70 IBUs would be considered imbalanced for the style and would occupy it's own experimental category.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I haven't looked for a full toxicology report (not that I would be able to understand it), but &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_health#Hops" rel="nofollow"&gt;this Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt; mentions that hops causes hyperthermia and may cause death.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Spent hops (hops dumped from a brew kettle) may cause hyperthermia in dogs in addition to raw hops, so you should never dump them as fertilizer in an area accessible to dogs.

					&lt;p&gt;Beer is bad for dogs (and cats!) due to the alcohol. I don't know about the hops, but I wouldn't risk it with my pets. It seems like someone sneaking booze into a punch bowl -- the animals that trust you aren't consenting to it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Independently of any ingredients like hops and barley, beer and any other beverage or food containing alcohol is &lt;strong&gt;SUPER BAD&lt;/strong&gt; for your dog.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A few drops licked from the floor may not be a problem for a 70 pound dog (like mine) but in greater concentrations such as a cup or bowl it will cause your dog's liver to fail killing him/her in a short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It also depends on how much the dog weights and his/her particular sensibility to alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hop Union has an "&lt;a href="http://www.hopunion.com/aroma-wheel/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Aroma Wheel&lt;/a&gt;" that can help with scent:  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also look at the &lt;a href="http://www.hopunion.com/hop-varieties/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Hop Variety&lt;/a&gt; page to get a little more information.&lt;br&gt;
					The thing to remember is scent doesn't always translate to taste, especially with hoppy beers such as IPA's after the beer has aged a bit. To get the taste you really need to try a beer made only with that hop (my opinion) to see what characteristics it imparts. Hop Union does have a &lt;a href="http://www.hopunion.com/hop-and-brew-school/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Hop and Brew School&lt;/a&gt; every year for both craft (professional) brewers and home brewers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can buy a small selection of a few hops and a 6 or 12 pack of bud light or coors light.  Pop the tops, toss in a few hops, re-cap and mark what hop is in each.  Wait a day or two and then taste.  This will highlight the aroma and some of the upfront flavors of the hop more than it's bitterness and will get you familiar with that hop variety.  This does require having a bottle caper and some caps, but those can be bought either at a local homebrew store or online for less than 20 dollars when you purchase the small 1oz bags of hops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you homebrew, try to brew small brew in a bag batches of 1 gallon to try different hop varieties. I don't do it too often but it's an easy 3 hour brew day and helps a lot with identifying hop profiles for bitterness, late addition, and dry hopping.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is a great question, I'm still learning but here's what I've tried:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Single hop beers.&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm in the UK but here's what I've managed to get in the past&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://mikkeller.dk/2013/07/05/single-hop-ipas/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mikkeller&lt;/a&gt; single hop series &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;IPA is dead by &lt;a href="http://www.brewdog.com/blog-article/ipa-is-dead-2013" rel="nofollow"&gt;BrewDog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Arbor often do single hop beers&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your mileage may vary but if you keep your eye out, hopefully you'll find a local brewer doing this kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've also had a couple of single yeast flights which were very enlightening.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Tastings&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A couple of hops really stick in my mind because of when I had them. I remember going to a tasting of a local's brewers Galaxy IPA and he'd filled the shop with glasses of Galaxy hops and it smelled incredable.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another time was tasting a Sorachi Ace beer by Wiper and True. It was horrific, but hearing the descriptions my fellow drinkers came up with and having the brewer explaining the history of the hop really anchored it to me. It meant when I had Little Things that Kill by weird beard, I could pick it out straight away.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The other thing that I enjoy is learning where and when and why a hop has come about. European hops are so different from American which are different again from British. Not to mention New Zealand hops which have their own aromas. Obviously it's not always consistant but being able to say what kind of region a hop tastes like is a good start!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The malt is providing the sweetness and the hops are providing the bitterness plus the lingering flavour.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Depending on what type malted grains the beer is brewed will effect its sweetness. This is due to how much fermentatble sugar can be extracted from the grains, any non-fermentable sugars will stay in the beer and provide effect how the beer sweetness. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hops are used in different stages of the brewing process to provide different functions.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hops are added at the intial point of the boiling process (which is usually about 60mins) - The hops oils released from the hops at this stage provide the beer with head retention, bitterness and also natural perservative. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hops are then again added during the final stage of the boiling process (last 10-15mins) - At this point the hops are providing the lingering taste that you are noting, plus any aroma notes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Getting a full list would always be tough as new varieties are being developed all the time. Looking at the above list I see a couple of varieties that have been out a couple of years that are missing (Mosaic for example).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yakima Chief Hop Union has a pretty up to date list and since they deal in selling hops it probably would be a good source of the latest ones out there.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some breweries use a hop "Torpedo", where the beer is forced through a chamber containing the desired aroma hops:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://byo.com/hops/item/1899-torpedoes-away" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://byo.com/hops/item/1899-torpedoes-away&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;None, the hops are added to provide a bitter flavour and because they have an antibiotic property that favours yeast over other microorganisms.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The hops are filtered out in the brewing process so there is no calorific gain.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In a typical UK beer recipe the hops are typically 1% of the dry ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First off, I don't know if this story is in fact true, but I can shed some light on the subject which would indicate that it is certainly plausible.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hops were first used to flavor beer around 1000 A.D., starting in Germany.  Until this time beer was flavored with a mix of herbs and spices called "gruit" which was taxed (generally by either the government or the Roman Catholic Church) and in many cases required by law, so when hops did appear, they appears in regions where the church had less control.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hops didn't make their way to England until around 1500 A.D., and weren't universally used until around the year 1600.   Since Henry VIII reigned from 1509 until 1547, it would have been early in the introduction of hops to the region, and it is certainly within the realm of possibility that he may have outlawed them as a threat to the tax revenue stream provided by the sale of gruit.   Eventually though, demand for hops won out, and Henry's own wars with the Catholic Church may have weakened the ability to gruit rights-holders to continue to monopolize the market, and as I mentioned, by fifty years after Henry's death, hops ultimately won the war.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The short answer is No.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ian Horney in "A History of Beer and Brewing" makes this claim[0].  But it is not backed up by evidence.  Henry VIII's beer brewer John Pope was given special dispensation to hire more than four foreign workers for the household brewery[1].  So at least Henry VIII's court brewed their own beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The various laws are being used to differentiate between Ale and Beer.  Ale being made with a selection of herbs known as a "gruit" - that must not contain hops.  Whereas beer was flavoured with hops (and possibly other herbs).  The generic use of hops was never banned[2], but the use of hops &lt;em&gt;in ale&lt;/em&gt; was controlled.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This discussion would be more suitable in the homebrew stack as Andrew said, but I will answer it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You are on the right track, making a simple pilsner recipe will show you the effects of the malt, yeast, water and hops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is a technique called SMASH (single malt, single hops), which is widely used to "test" the effect of a new ingredient. It is pretty much exactly what you are doing. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The best technique: brew as often as possible. Be critical of your beer. Get a BJCP judge (or similar) to try your beer and give you feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Relax, dont worry, have a homebrew. (Papasian).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Try to make a tea out of the hops.
					Put a flower or a pellet in a mug,
					Pour boiling water over it,
					Wait for 10 minutes,
					Taste,
					Make notes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Try to get hold of some samples of hops at local or regional (home)brewers.
					Most likely they will be happy to help out a fellow brewer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Water does a fair job of dissolving the aromatic compounds in hops but the resinous or oily compounds will dissolve better in ethanol. To get a really clean extract of hops, steep fresh or dry hops in vodka or neutral grain spirits, then filter and dilute with water for tasting. The straight extract can be overwhelming. A really good extract will be a milky yellow color.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, try adding the extract to an un-hopped beer to to see how the flavor changes when mixed with other ingredients. When hops are boiled in the wort during brewing, the heat can cause chemical reactions between the aromatics and other ingredients, giving the brew a slightly different flavor than the uncooked flavor of the extracts.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;We grow hops and my husband loves IPAs so he makes these hop extracts to mix with beer and cocktails.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finding a compiled list of common-marketplace lagers is probably not going to happen unless someone has made a specific list &lt;a href="http://gearpatrol.com/2016/04/13/best-american-lagers/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Generally, you would just search "&lt;em&gt;SPECIFIC BEER&lt;/em&gt; IBU" and either the result or website where you can find the result would populate.

					&lt;p&gt;For proprietary reasons, you will never know the exact make-up of hops/hop ratios in beers unless the &lt;a href="https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/how-to-brew/craft-breweries-share-homebrew-clone-recipes/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;company shares that information with their imbibers.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you have a good palate and understanding of what &lt;a href="http://appellationbeer.com/blog/hop-union-hop-aroma-wheel/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;kinds of hops&lt;/a&gt; yield what &lt;a href="https://byo.com/resources/hops" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;kinds of flavors&lt;/a&gt;, you might be able to pick them out.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;List of ibu's:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Stella: 30 &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Kronenbourg 1664: 20&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Corona: 10&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Fosters: 12&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Becks: 20&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Heineken: 23&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;San Miguel: 12&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The difference in IBU seems to come from the type of beer, Heineken en Becks are quite similar european lagers with the same ingredients(barly, yeast water and hops) while Corona uses corn and rice with much les hops. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Grohlier already gave a good answer for the second question.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I looked through my beer books and I couldn't find a single word that describes the addition of hops. Generally brewers describe the addition of hops based on their intended flavoring. Bittering additions or aroma additions. There are a variety of additions depending on timing. Here is a partial list:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First Wort Hopping - Added before the wort is boiled&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Bittering - 90-45 minutes before end of wort boiling&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Flavoring - 40-20 minutes before end of wort boiling&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finishing - 15-0 minutes before end of wort boiling&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Flameout - after the finish of boil and before pitching yeast&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Dry Hopping - during or after beer fermenting&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://howtobrew.com/book/section-1/hops/how-are-they-used" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;How Hops are used&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From what I understand, pale ale is not as hoppy as India pale ale. So, quantity of hops and IBU of IPA’s will be generally higher compared to pale ales. American pale ales use American hops instead of traditionally popular European hops from what I understand.&lt;/p&gt;
