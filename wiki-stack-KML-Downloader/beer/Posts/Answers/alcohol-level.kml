					&lt;p&gt;Beer is an alcoholic beverage produced by the saccharification of starch and fermentation of the resulting sugar. The starch and saccharification enzymes are often derived from malted cereal grains, most commonly malted barley and malted wheat.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It can be influinced and is often influenced during the brewing process, by adding sugar (which gets transformed into alcohol) at certain phases during the brewing process. Several beers first get brewn on a barrel and then after a few weeks put onto a bottle after which sugar may be added. Adding the sugar causes a seconds fermentation which will result in a higher alcohol level. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Often deeper tastes as experienced with for instance a La Trappe, Rocherfort 10 or Westvleteren are the effect of the higher alcohol level. While alcohol certainly plays a role in the beer's taste, spices and herbs are also important for the beer's taste body.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/110/what-is-the-highest-alcohol-content-achievable-through-brewing?rq=1"&gt;This might be a duplicate question&lt;/a&gt;, but since as far as I know beer uses fermentation and no distillation, I expect the maximum alcohol level to be around the same maximum as for wine, which I believe is &lt;a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090518144252AA2xvY1" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;somewhere around the 13% to 15% level (by volume) as this is the level around which micro organisms seem to die&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I know some beers in the 10% to 12% range, like the Dutch &lt;a href="http://www.biernet.nl/bier/merken/grolsch-kanon" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;het Kanon ("the canon") by Grolsch&lt;/a&gt; at 11.6% and &lt;a href="http://www.biernet.nl/bier/merken/hertog-jan-grand-prestige" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Grand Prestige by Hertog Jan&lt;/a&gt; at 10%, both of which I like. They have a bit of a sweet caramel-like flavour, but I'm not sure if that related to the amount of alcohol in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There has been a bit of a battle recently, with Brewdog and Schorschbräu constantly topping each other's efforts: &lt;a href="http://www.brewdog.com/blog-article/the-battle-to-brew-the-worlds-strongest-ever-beer" rel="nofollow"&gt;BrewDog Blog.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Currently it's a &lt;strong&gt;Schorschbräu Schorschbock 57% finis coronat opus, which comes in at 57.7%&lt;/strong&gt;, beating Brewdog's latest effort: &lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/schorschbrau-schorschbock-57-finis-coronat-opus/154245/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Schorschbräu Schorschbock 57% finis coronat opus.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'd say the strongest commercially viable option &lt;em&gt;(these 50% beers only ever have a few bottles in the batch and cost a silly amount)&lt;/em&gt; in the UK anyway, is &lt;strong&gt;Watt Dickie&lt;/strong&gt;, also by Brewdog, which comes in at &lt;strong&gt;35.0%&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.brewdog.com/product/watt-dickie" rel="nofollow"&gt;BrewDog UK.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;EDIT:&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Oops, I didn't know about &lt;strong&gt;Snake Venom, 67.5%&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.brewmeister.co.uk/#/snake-venom/4580369643" rel="nofollow"&gt;Brewmeister Beer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I suppose it depends on how one defines beer. Following the German Reinheitsgebot, beer may contain only 4 ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Water&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Yeast&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Hops&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Barly malt&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beverages which do not adhere to these restrictions may not be labeled as beer in Germany, and several other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To my knowlege, the strongest beer of kind is &lt;a href="http://www.benz-weltweit.de/derbraeuvomberch/index2.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Schorschbock 57&lt;/a&gt;, an ice-distilled doppelbock with 57,5% alcohol content.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It depends on your definition, commercially available is Kwak, around the same as wine, if you go to the Grand Place it comes in those horse &amp;amp; cart designed bulbous glasses (like a mini yard of ale). Once you go above that the others are all pretty specialist.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Barley wine is a style of beer: it isn't something that is made using beer as an ingredient (as you might describe whisky).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a number of varieties of barley wine (some hoppy, and some with almost no hop characteristics), but they all have a relatively high alcohol content compared to most beers.  The alcohol is produced via fermentation, the same as any other beer, and without distillation.  Note that not all high alcohol beers are necessarily described as "barley wine" though.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for the legal aspects, I don't know of any regulations that specifically target barley wine.  The law usually deals with alcoholic beverages based on the alcohol content, and from that point of view barley wines would usually be treated similar to normal wines due to the similar ABV.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is easier to reason about how to derive the alcohol-by-weight value from the alcohol-by-volume rather than the reverse.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;abv&lt;/code&gt; is the alcohol-by-volume value expressed as a number between 0 and 1, then for a unit volume of the liquid, the weight of the alcohol will be &lt;code&gt;0.789 * abv&lt;/code&gt;.  Similarly, the weight of the non-alcohol component will be &lt;code&gt;1 - abv&lt;/code&gt; (assuming it has a density of 1).  So the total weight of the liquid will be:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  0.789 * abv + (1 - abv)
					= 1 - 0.211 * abv
					&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Using the weight of alcohol and the total weight, we can easily determine the alcohol-by-weight (also expressed as a number between 0 and 1):&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;abw = 0.789 * abv / (1 - 0.211 * abv)
					&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So this is clearly not linear (it is &lt;a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.789*v%2F%281-0.211*v%29" rel="nofollow"&gt;hyperbolic&lt;/a&gt;), and maintains identity for the 0% and 100% cases as expected.  We can invert the equation in a few steps:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;                    0.789 * abv = abw * (1 - 0.211 * abv)
					                    0.789 * abv = abw - 0.211 * abv * abw
					0.789 * abv + 0.211 * abv * abw = abw
					    (0.789 + 0.211 * abw) * abv = abw
					                            abv = abw / (0.789 + 0.211 * abw)
					&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So that confirms the formula you derived.  &lt;a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=inverse%20of%200.789*v%2F%281-0.211*v%29" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wolfram Alpha&lt;/a&gt; seems to agree.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_by_volume" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Alcohol by volume (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;ABV * 0.78924 = ABW * SpecificGravity(at 20°C in g/ml)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Thus ABV = ABW * SpecificGravity / 0.78924&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This formula is only correct for a mixture of ethanol and pure water. You can't plug in the s.g. of your beer and have it work.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have found tables that relate ABW to specific gravity for ethanol/water solutions, one can be found &lt;a href="http://www.handymath.com/cgi-bin/ethanolwater3.cgi?submit=Entry" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I dumped the table into a spreadsheet, and used the formula to create a conversion table for ABV and ABW.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Please note that the formula is not completely accurate against the table, 100% ABW calculates to 100.01% ABV. 0.01% difference is not really significant for our purposes. Not sure if the table or formula is incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is no significant difference in preparation between barley wine and any other strong ale, some barley wines are made with OG's as low as 1.062 (Smithwick's) and the main characteristic is they have very strong kilned malt flavors.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In my opinion Barley Wine is to Malt, what an IPA is to Hops. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A key distinction between barley wine and other strong ales is the presence of residual sugars. When made right, the yeast will be unable to finish fermentation due the high alcohol content. The remaining sugars should then provide the complex fruity/malty/toasty flavors mentioned in the bjcp guide.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Well, they don't mean anything in particular really, because this is fiction. However, if we want to play analysis, the answer would certainly be whiskey, American bourbon most likely. Let's go through the choices. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;1) Wine. No way. If someone is going to generically order wine, they at least specify a color, red or white. Plus wine is mostly all the same strength, only varying a couple percent either direction, unless you count fortified wines, which are another topic. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;2) Beer. Ordering a generic beer would get you a basic beer, which isn't very strong. Only a few specialized beer bars would have any beers that I'd call really strong. Any beer stronger than 12% is going to be very rare, with most bars not even having above 8%. The kinds of people who order strong beers, these 8, 9, 10, etc beers, would always order by name. They are craft beer fans. These aren't really strong enough to help someone in distress. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;3) Vodka. Unless you are a Russian or a huge vodka fan, you don't order vodka straight like this. Vodka is generally for mixing in America. The people who are serious about vodka drinking would order by brand name.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;4) Gin is the same story as vodka really. Gin in generally served in mixed form, although a dry gin martini is close to 100% gin, it still counts as mixed. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;5) Cordials, liquers, etc. Again, would be ordered by type or brand, and often not that strong compared to the main liquors. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;6) Rum, can be quite strong, makes decent shots, makes decent sipping. But it conjours up images of pirate and or topical locations. If the movie is set in the Caribbean, they would mean rum. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;7) Tequila. It's strong, makes good shots. Not so great for sipping, unless you are talking about the really good stuff or you are a tequila fan. If you are in Mexico or a Cantina, they would mean tequila. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;8) Whiskey. This is the winning category. It's always strong. It tastes good in shots, and makes fine sipping from a glass. This is manly and good for all classes of life. Blue collars and white collars alike love whiskey. if you are doing, "forget your troubles" kinda drinking, whiskey is the best choice. If you are sad, or upset, or worried, or looking for a fight, or anything like that, whiskey is the best choice. A real American manly man is going to want whiskey, usually bourbon, something like Knob's Creek. Some will prefer Irish whiskeys, or Scottish Whiskys, (notice no e), but if they do, they will say so by name. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I mean, I know if I was upset like that and going to a bar and said a stupid order like gimme a strong one, I would mean bourbon. If I wanted a beer, to get back on topic, I'd be like, "What kind of IPAs you got?" "Any sours?"&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;:)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Eating will absorb some of the alcohol. Drinking on an empty stomach means the alcohol can go directly to the blood stream and the effects of the alcohol will happen faster. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So if you have food in you, especially breads, it will rather slow the process of getting drunk.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Of course you could eat four loaves of bread a slam a bottle of liquor in less then a minute and it won't help you there. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Strange question, but here goes: No, on both.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explanation:&lt;/strong&gt; 
					To make a beer strong requires a LOT of ingredients and of these the ones that provide sugars for the yeast are most important. The large volume of ingredients means that the beer will (usually) have complex malt flavours.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mashing:&lt;/strong&gt;
					We immediately run into a problem: You can only get so much sugar out of malt. So you use all sorts of tricks to get the most out of your malt.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boiling:&lt;/strong&gt;
					To increase the sugar content the brewers add sugars to the wort. Next problem: too much sugar and the beer does not taste very good and fermentation problems are a possible problem. (Sugars can also be added to the fermentation). Another trick is to concentrate the wort by boiling for a longer period. The water evaporates, but the sugars and other ingredients stay in the wort. Note that a large amount of hops is required to balance all the sugars.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fermentation:&lt;/strong&gt; High gravity beers are notoriously difficult to ferment. The biggest problem is that the alcohol in the beer becomes so much that it poisons the yeast. So, you need a yeast that is "strong" enough to work in these harsh conditions. You will often find that brewers will mix strains, starting with a lager, then going to ale, then to champagne or wine yeast. Most "normal" yeasts will (with help) get you a product of 15-20% ABV. Stronger yeasts can go higher than 20%, but not much further.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post Fermentation:&lt;/strong&gt;
					Lest assume that you ended with a naturally fermented product of 20%. Fermentation is complete and your yeast is dead. The alcohol kills any other yeast that you add. What next? Ice concentration! This process is seen as a form of distilling. You put your fermenter in a freezer and scoop out the ice crystals. As water freezes before alcohol, the alcohol in the beer increases. Stronger beer! But the penalty is that you use a lot of flavour and aroma during this process.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The final product:&lt;/strong&gt; A boozy, typically malty, bready, product, usually on the sweeter side. The body tends to be heavy. Hops is usually low to none, unless the beer was dry-hopped post concentration.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of the strongest beers:
					&lt;a href="http://www.beertutor.com/beers/index.php?t=highest_alcohol" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.beertutor.com/beers/index.php?t=highest_alcohol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would suggest the extra kick would be due to the fact that as you smoke the cigarette, you are taking in nicotine, which does enhance the effect of alcohol. So the effect is not coming from the ash, but the cigarette you smoke to get the ash.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have experienced the following: I can drink vast volumes whilst flying. However, when we come in to land (cabin pressure changes) I got very drunk, very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think the cabin pressure is the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The 'kick' you are describing is being caused by a mild altitude sickness. As you can read in these &lt;a href="http://www.asma.org/asma/media/asma/travel-publications/paxguidelines.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;medical guidelines for airline passengers&lt;/a&gt; the cabin pressure is contrary to popular belief, not pressurized to sea level pressure:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;On most flights the cabin altitude will be between 6,000 and 8,000 ft.
					  (1,828m and 2,438m) even though the aircraft is flying at much higher
					  altitudes. In other words, on most flights, it is as if you are on top
					  of a hill or small mountain. This imposes two stresses on the body:
					  &lt;strong&gt;less oxygen;&lt;/strong&gt; and, expansion of gases in the body cavities.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The reason for feeling drunk more quickly is due to the lack of oxygen presented by the lack of pressure. Lack of oxygen, according to &lt;a href="http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/answered-questions/when-drinking-same-amount-alcohol-are-you-more-intoxicated-air-ground" rel="nofollow"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; source, gives rise to the following symptoms and comes to the same conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;There are various symptoms, including dizziness, lightheadedness,
					  fatigue, drowsiness, weakness, nausea, unsteady gait, and a headache.
					  Sounds familiar, right? Yeah, the symptoms of altitude sickness are a
					  lot like the effects of alcohol intoxication.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another interesting read can be found &lt;a href="http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/answered-questions/when-drinking-same-amount-alcohol-are-you-more-intoxicated-air-ground" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is caused by two things.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;1)
					When you drink with a straw the liquid touches your palate (upper part of your mouth) more, the skin in your palate is thin and strongly circulated (with blood) this accelerates the absorption of alcohol in the blood. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;2)
					Sucking fluid trough the straw requires a lower than ambient pressure in the lungs and mouth. This lower pressure causes more of the alcohol to evaporate, this alcohol is absorbed by the lungs again increasing alcohol absorption.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While drinking with a straw will get you drunk faster it will not necessarily get you more drunk as this is mostly just related to the amount of consumed alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of different factors that provide the alcohols percentage,&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;It's not really the liquid burning. It's the vapors that catch fire.
					  Higher proof equals more vapor, depending on temperature. &lt;a href="http://gizmodo.com/5935493/five-scientifically-surprising-facts-about-booze" rel="nofollow"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So burning alcohol is not a guaranteed way of finding out the percentage as whilst cooking wine will 'flame on' despite being low percentage and this is all to do with the vapor of the alcohol. Sure a High proof alcohol will catch fire easier but that will only tell you that it is a high proof alcohol not the percentage in it. A low proof vodka can ignite if a flame is held to it as the change in temperature will make it produce more vapor and it will ignite&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;(Please don't try and set fire to alcohol if you don't need to it can course spillage that will then cause an out of control fire and we don't want any of you guys to start burning up on us now )&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You don't define "burn" and I don't find a reference.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Is burn distill or literally burn.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Fire requires heat, oxygen, and fuel.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Flash point is the temp it will burn with an external ignition source. The flash point is a function of temp. Not much effected by humidity.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;The flash points of ethanol wt % concentrations[102]
					wt %    Temperature
					10%     49 °C (120 °F)
					20%     36 °C (97 °F)
					30%     29 °C (84 °F)
					40%     26 °C (79 °F)
					50%     24 °C (75 °F)
					60%     22 °C (72 °F)
					70%     21 °C (70 °F)
					80%     20 °C (68 °F)
					90%     17 °C (63 °F)
					96%     17 °C (63 °F)
					&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Even at the flash point it will not generate enough heat to continue burning once the external ignition source is removed.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Burn off would be hard to gauge and I don't think any alcohol (for human consumption) would burn 1/2 off at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Give 1/2 is the threshold it is more like they just boiled the alcohol off in a pot. The boiling point of alcohol is 173 F. Just stop when the temp get to 173F. 50% would be 100 proof. Yes some water boils off even at 173 and some alcohol is left behind. But it is about a wash.  I would say the margin of error would be like 5%. If you did a true batch distillation would be within 1%.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your liver processes alcohol at a fixed rate (what that rate is depends on your tolerance, current liver function, what medications you are taking, and some genetics). So eating some food, particularly foods that absorb fluids like bread, will slow down the rate of alcohol absorption into your bloodstream, allowing your liver more time to metabolize the alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So for a fixed amount of alcohol, drinking on a full stomach will make you FEEL less drunk because you spread out the alcohol absorption over time so your liver has more time to metabolize it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, you can still saturate your livers ability to metabolize alcohol by ingesting high volumes of alcohol and the absorptive ability of the food in your stomach is limited (unless you vomit it out) so it is FAR from reliable technique to drink but avoid becoming intoxicated or hungover since you are still absorbing all the ingested alcohol, just over a slightly longer period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The acidity (ph) of ethanol is relatively neutral (roughly equivalent to water), so milks and creams will typically mix fine with ethanol. In fact, it's the basis of many popular alcoholic beverages, like and "egg nog" (which is a spirit, a whole egg, cream and simple syrup), or the White Russian (vodka and milk). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Milk or cream-based beverages can become curdled, but it requires a high level of acidity (e.g. lime juice) to be introduced prior to consumption.  It's why the "cement mixer" shot becomes curdled (the combination of cream in the "Irish Cream" and lime juice). If you are not familiar, do not try to drink a cement mixer "shot", it is typically considered a really bad prank to pull on an unsuspecting victim. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement_Mixer_(drink)" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement_Mixer_(drink)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Even though butter milk is slightly more acidic than regular milk or creme, it's not enough to cause a reaction like curdling (unless you add the aforementioned high level of acid). Plus, milk already curds somewhat on its own in the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is a popular myth that drinking buttermilk (or regular milk) prior to alcohol consumption has preventative benefits (i.e. "hangover cure"). However, there is no scientific evidence that supports the claim that drinking any type of milk (even buttermilk) before consuming alcohol does anything to stave off or reduce hangovers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Conversely, it is well known that alcohol consumption slows digestion and reduces absorption of nutrients, especially those found in milk. This is because the alcohol reduces the secretion of digestive enzymes, which are what breaks down food in the stomach, including milk proteins and sugars. Alcohol also increases acid levels in the stomach, but it doesn't typically cause major negative side effects, when consumed in moderation, unless there is already another medical factor present. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;High levels of milk or creams, followed by excessive alcohol intake can produce effects similar to lactose intolerance, because the milk sugars are not digested well and move into the intestines. Once excess sugars are in the intestines, the bacteria there consumes the sugars and produces large amounts of gas. High levels of sugar in the intestines also causes more-than-normal amounts of water to be drawn into the intestines...a.k.a. "diarrhea".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As long as you aren't eating cheese curd sandwiches, made with flourless (i.e. all-cheese) cheese bread, with 5 slices of cheese and cheese soup, followed by high levels of alcohol, you should be fine.  Moderation with all things is the key.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Note: If you are diabetic, you run the risk of much higher levels of milk sugars going into the intestines and should consult a physician, because prolonged sugars in the intestines and stomach can lead to gastritis or even ulcers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As happy as the above comments may make you, ashes in your beer is not a big deal and frankly, I'm amazed at the question. I tried your experiment of adding cigarette ashes into my coffee.  I have to say I was disappointed.  Besides seeing the happiness on the faces around me, I can't say it made any difference in the taste.  Now beer on the other hand may have a more profound taste change due to the ashes.  It really depends on the kind of beer and the type of ashes.   However, I do believe that if you like beer you might not even notice the ashes.  For example, if I'm looking into a beer glass and something is floating inside, I would be surprised to even notice it.  From the point of view of the ashes.  I can only surmise that they would prefer to go into an ash tray.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Answer: no, there is no change in taste in small amounts of ashes.  The more ashes you add to the beer the more of a scratchy texture but no difference in taste.  If you fill the whole beer with ashes you might find it milk shake like but bitter.  If you ever try that I'd like to hear your experirences.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm a Chemical Engineer and it frustrates me that everywhere on the internet appears to be using this linear approximation. Yeah it's probably okay for hobby brewers, but for anyone actually interested in solving the problem for example use in software design or higher ABV products, this approximation is really not good enough. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is actually a ridiculously complicated subject and it all boils down to the fact that at a molecular level, water and ethanol interact with one another with what are known as hydrogen bonds. Now you can just use an empirical lookup table or regress a tonne of data, but if you're interested in the root of this problem you should do some research into what are known as equations of state. In particular &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIQUAC" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;UNIQUAC&lt;/a&gt; for ethanol-water mixtures. It get's even worse when you realise that these equations of state describe gaseous behaviour remarkably well, but require additional thought to be applied to liquids. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;People dedicate their entire lives into perfecting a generalised equation of state to describe the interactions between all chemical components. ANYWAY I digress... &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've done some number crunching myself using UNIQUAC and have come up with the following simple formula. Like yours above, it's only applicable to ethanol-water mixtures, and I've only validated this equation up to an ABV of 50% so be weary of going higher. This equation has an R-Squared value of 1. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;ABW = 0.1893*ABV*ABV + 0.7918*ABV + 0.0002&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Try it yourself :)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Please allow me to recommend a nice red classic Italian wine called &lt;a href="http://www.gourmetsleuth.com/ingredients/detail/chianti" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Chianti&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From this &lt;a href="http://www.gourmetsleuth.com/features/wine-cheese-pairing-guide" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wine and Cheese Pairing Guide&lt;/a&gt; we can see that Chianti is paired well to the &lt;strong&gt;Pecorino Romano Cheese&lt;/strong&gt; and nuts. I know that you are using a &lt;em&gt;Columella's Caciofiore&lt;/em&gt; cheese that is "considered a sort of "ancestor" of the Roman pecorino cheese, prepared with rennet based on cardoon."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.parks.it/romanatura/Edettaglio_prodotto.php?id_prodotti=2078" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Columella's Caciofiore&lt;/a&gt; can be considered a sort of "ancestor" of the &lt;strong&gt;Roman Pecorino Cheese&lt;/strong&gt;, prepared with rennet based on cardoon. Columella talks about this cheese in his treatise "De Rustica": "It is better to curdle the milk with lamb or kid rennet, although it is also possible to curdle it with the cardoon flower or with safflower seeds or fig latex. Anyway, the best cheese is made with as less treatment as possible". (Lucio Giunio Moderato Columella, "De Rustica", 50 AD). Today, in the Roman Countryside, "native country" of the cardoon and the artichoke, some producers still use the cardoon flower as rennet and prepare raw milk pecorino cheese with an ancient taste. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Chianti red wine could be substituted with a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangiovese" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Sangiovese&lt;/a&gt; red wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the olives or spices are over powering the taste of your dish you may wish to use a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlot" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Merlot Wine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If it is a fortified wine you are after, would like to recommend a &lt;strong&gt;fortified Madeira Wine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Fortified wines, like port, sherry and Madeira, also go very well with rich cheeses. A classic match is English Stilton and port, but other blue cheeses also taste lovely alongside a glass of sweet, flavourful port. - &lt;a href="http://www.castellocheese.com/en/the-journal/2016/7/pairing-red-wine-with-cheese/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Pairing red wine with cheese&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The only answer would be an aged Madeira or Port. I think either would be an excellent accompaniment to the foods are your choosing. Make sure they are fairly old. 10+ years old at least. The older the better...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Best wine I ever had was a 1780s Madeira. Each bottle alone was over $10,000 and a glass at the restaurant was $1000. I know the restaurant owner and he let me have a taste. It was sublime! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing this the strongest beer in circulation is a scottish made larger/pilsner &lt;a href="http://coolmaterial.com/home/brewmeister-snake-venom-the-worlds-strongest-beer/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Snake Venom By Brewmeister&lt;/a&gt;, this beer is 67.5% ABV. and is strongly recommended that you only drink small amounts in a sitting, buying a bottle(275ml) of this would set you back a &lt;a href="http://www.drinksupermarket.com/brewmeister-snake-venom-275ml-bottle" rel="noreferrer"&gt;£54.99&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Other than this beer there was &lt;em&gt;Koelschip Mistery Of Beer - Brouwerij het Koelschip&lt;/em&gt; that was 70% ABV but as I'm aware is no longer in circulation and has had production stopped as the brewery shut down &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; alcohol goes the strongest spirit is &lt;a href="http://www.theliquorbarn.com/polmos-spirytus-rektyfikowany-192-proof" rel="noreferrer"&gt;spirytus rektyfikowany&lt;/a&gt; which is a 96% Vodka. The cheapest you will find this is a small bottle(10cl) and  this will cost &lt;a href="https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/28833/spirytus-rektyfikowany-96-polmos-small-bottle" rel="noreferrer"&gt;£7.95&lt;/a&gt; It is is strongly recommended to not drink this neat as it would be damaging &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For myself, I have found that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everclear_(alcohol)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Everclear&lt;/a&gt; is the strongest spirits I have ever bought at 190 proof. Although it is too strong for myself to drink by itself, it makes excellent mixes. Some people have use it to extract the medicinal properties out of plants because of its' strength. It also comes in 150(1) proof bottles too.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KjPmw.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KjPmw.jpg" alt="A bottle of 190-proof Everclear"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everclear_(alcohol)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;A bottle of 190-proof Everclear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The lower proof Everclear is much easier to find and is quite common in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The 190 proof (95% ABV) is sold at &lt;a href="http://www.bevmo.com/catalog/product/view/id/12001" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Bevmo&lt;/a&gt;, depending on your state.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can buy scientific grade Ethanol, usually at a science supply shop. Many of them only sell it in person. It is usually 99.5% or &lt;strong&gt;199 proof!&lt;/strong&gt;. For that extra kick if Everclear isn't strong enough for you!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The strongest absinthe on the UK market. Serve well diluted for your own safety and keep well away from naked flames. The term premium reserve refers to the high strength, with original being the 'weakest' (though still 72.5%) and super deluxe being in the middle. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Please note this is a high-strength product and we recommend not drinking neat – please enjoy diluted or with a mixer of your choice. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Indirect answer  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;95% or 190 proof is an upper end for distilled alcohol    &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Water and ethanol form an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azeotrope" rel="noreferrer"&gt;azeotrop&lt;/a&gt; at that mixture so you can not get more than 95% ethanol with fractional distillation. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spirytus Rektyfikowany&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The purity of rectified spirit has a practical limit of 95.6% ABV; this hard to pronounce Polish Vodka is a murderous 96% ABV.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hb2ON.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hb2ON.jpg" alt="Spirytus Rektyfikowany"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here are the &lt;a href="https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/28833/spirytus-rektyfikowany-96-polmos-small-bottle" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;details&lt;/a&gt; on the bottle:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;A 10cl bottle of rectified spirit from Poland bottled at the extreme ABV of 96%. This is often used as a base for liqueurs and other infusions, 
					  and we highly recommend that it is never drunk neat.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/warning-over-deadly-spirits/news-story/dc0551387398300ea4103267466fdb8e" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Australia's "Courier Mail"&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;National Alliance for Action on Alcohol co-chairman Professor Mike Daube said it was "amazingly irresponsible'' for stores to sell the liquor, which had the potential to cause serious damage to drinkers or even kill them.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Prof Daube said the extreme nature of the product could appeal to young binge &gt; drinkers, and putting the product next to normal spirits could endanger people
					  who did not read the label properly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For those who wish to drink something from Bolivia, there is Cocoroco which is an alcoholic beverage notable for its extremely high alcohol content by volume, 96%.  (ABV).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I know you are looking for "normal outlets", but for those who are interested, the world record holder for a while was Estonian Spirit aka Eesti Piiritus at 96.6%.  You can still find some for sale at auctions.  I brought a few bottles back when you could still buy it and foolishly did a shot of it.  Never trying that again!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You seem to be asking two questions, I'll try to answer both although a lot of this is conjecture:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Why are spirits in India poured in multiples of 30ml?&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is likely due to 30ml being easy to both measure out and to drink. 30 ml is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_glass#Sizes" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;pretty standard world-wide&lt;/a&gt; as a small or single measure, and multiplying a small measure (rather than have, say, 30ml followed by 50ml) makes things easy. 20ish g of pure alcohol (large peg) or 10g (small peg) is right in line with many countries' "standard drink"s (e.g. the UK "unit" is 8g, but a typical drink has between &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_alcohol" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;1 and 3 units&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Conceivably, the "peg" might be a semi-standardization of an old northern Indian unit of mass called the &lt;em&gt;chhatank&lt;/em&gt;, which appears to correspond roughly to 60g, but I think that's more likely a coincidence. 4 of them made up a &lt;em&gt;pao&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;pau&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;pav&lt;/em&gt; - but that's almost certainly a red herring and unconnected.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Where and when did this sense of the word &lt;em&gt;peg&lt;/em&gt; come from?&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Likely after and as a consequence of the British Raj. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;OED&lt;/a&gt;'s sense 12 of &lt;em&gt;peg&lt;/em&gt; is&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;colloq. (&lt;em&gt;orig.&lt;/em&gt; Anglo-Indian). &lt;em&gt;Originally: a drink of brandy and soda water. Later more generally: a (usually alcoholic) drink, esp. of spirits; a measure of spirits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The first usage they have is from John Camden Hotten's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dictionary_of_Modern_Slang,_Cant,_and_Vulgar_Words" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Dictionary of Modern Slang, Cant, and Vulgar Words&lt;/a&gt;. All the 19th Century quotations they have seem to refer the mixture of a spirit and something sparkling, mostly soda water. The only clearly Indian quotation they have is from 2003 and refers to the 30ml measure, but they're entirely lacking in quotations between 1939 and 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It seems possible that in turn this usage came from OED's sense 2b, which has quotations going back to 1617:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any of a set of pins fixed at intervals in a drinking vessel to indicate the quantity each drinker is to drink. Now&lt;/em&gt; hist.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But that connection is not made explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There isn't going to be (or rather it wouldn't be visually appealing enough) a source for what you want. Your best bet is to search "::insert alcoholic family you wish here:: Infographics." When you do you will find that some people have made things like this from PopChartLabs! They have two great ones for Whiskey and Scotch too. &lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zDUpS.jpg" alt="BeerFam"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am pretty sure it gives you a kick but I don't think it's the one you are thinking of.
					I am interested in a more experienced answer because I went to a rural area near a village in a Mediterranean country recently  and they told me to watch out because guys in that area spike girls' drinks with cigarrette ashes so that they can get them more drunk or make them wanna puke so that they both 1) make fun of them and 2) can take advantage of them. 
					And there were some known solid incidents from the girls I met not just rumors so I'd say it does a good damn job. 
					I came across this because I'm looking for a way to avoid drinking something like that because that sounds like a freaking dangerous trap, but I can't find much.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here are some hard alcohol risks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hard Alcohol Risks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Hard alcohol consumption is contraindicated in certain segments of the population because of the latter’s higher susceptibility to the effects of the beverage. For instance, individuals who have difficulty sleeping, or suffer from depression or other mental disorders, are advised against intake as the psychoactive mechanism of the drink can further worsen said conditions. Consumption is also strongly advised against in pregnant women as it can lead to severe gross motor development, fetal alcohol syndrome, and sudden infant death syndrome, to name a few, in children who got exposed to hard alcohol in the womb. Persons who have to deal with chronic gastrointestinal disorders like irritable bowel syndrome have to steer clear as intake can severely aggravate the conditions as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;This beverage has a substantial concentration of ethanol per volume as well. Excess ethanol consumption inflicts sever damage to the liver and can bring about scarring or cirrhosis, inflammation or alcoholic hepatitis, and even cancer of said organ. This type of alcohol is associated with other cancers such as those afflicting the mouth and pharynx, the bowels, the breasts, the prostate, and the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Hard alcohol has a powerful diuretic effect as well. Because this is the case, individuals who have diarrhea, renal problems, or other medical conditions that are prone to severe dehydration must avoid consumption of this drink as well. Such fluid-draining effect of hard alcohol can instigate premature wrinkling of the skin due to dehydration, and may increase the frequency and severity of dermatological allergies like psoriasis and eczema. - &lt;a href="http://superhumancoach.com/negative-effects-of-hard-alcohol/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Secrets of the Superhuman Food Pyramid: Negative Effects of Hard Alcohol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These are just the tip of the iceberg, for drinking those extremely high levels of alcohol could lead to alcohol poisoning very fast and thus cause unconsciousness or even worse, death.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Alcohol overdosing is nothing unusual. It’s hard to come across anything beyond 40 percent at bars (unless on demand) because the higher the ABV (alcohol by volume), the higher are your chances of you getting knocked out. But still, there exists a dark land of spirits where ABV can go up to a suicidal 96 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spirytus Rektyfikowany (96% Alcohol)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The purity of rectified spirit has a practical limit of 95.6% ABV; this hard to pronounce Polish Vodka is a murderous 96% ABV. &lt;strong&gt;In short, abusing this drink can literally make you meet God!&lt;/strong&gt; Spirytus is actually more potent than the widely-known Everclear and sits atop as the world’s strongest alcoholic beverage. -  &lt;a href="http://www.mensxp.com/health/addiction/27309-10-alcoholic-drinks-so-strong-they-can-knock-out-the-manliest-of-you.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;10 Alcoholic Drinks So Strong They Can Knock Out The Manliest Of You&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The table prduced by Evil Genius should produce the correct answer. The error reported on 0.01% for 100% ABW is because the siource table given density of 100% alcohol as 0.789&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;4 and he divided by 0.789&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;4. Either the table or his divisor must be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's pretty unlikely.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Given that it was a commercial wine I don't there was much live, viable yeast in the bottle. Particularly if sulfites were added, triggering additional fermentation would probably be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;On top of that, refrigerating it for the whole 24 hours means that, even if there was viable yeast uninhibited by sulfites, it's very unlikely it much fermentation could occur. It's possible you could see some fermentation due to the Crabtree effect but it wouldn't have been much.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Highly unlikely that the alcohol went up. Four reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The alcohol already in the wine is a barrier for the yeast to re-ferment.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The sulfites in the wine could inhibit refermentation if it hasn't dissipated yet. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The cold temperatures that will also inhibit fermentation. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Many commercial wines are sterile filtered so yeast counts are zero to very, very tiny. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, in 24 hours it's highly unlikely that it fermented again. Your perception of alcohol may be enhanced by the sugar that you added. High alcohol wines routinely taste "sweeter" to many people even though sugar levels are low. You might have tricked yourself into thinking sweet wine = higher alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The feeling of alcoholicity, at tasting, is very dependant of many factors, such as temperature of beverage, sugar, glycerol and a few other molecules content, and of course personal abilities of the taster as well as the  preceeding tastings. Concerning the present situtation, a simple experiment is a comparative tasting : keeping two glasses of the same wine, in closed glasses (sealed with plastic film to limit oxygenation/oxidation), put them aside the honeyed bottle in the fridge ; then a few minutes before tasting, get them all off the fridge, serve a glass from the bottle ("glass 1"), in "glass 2" (one from the fridge) add the same relative quantity of the same honey that was added in the bottle, and in the last fridge glass ("glass 3"), add the same relative quantity of white sugar. Again seal the three glasses in order to mix "2" and "3", and let them dissolve their addings (without forgetting to shake "glass 1" as much as the 2 others), and finally get all three be at the same temperature. Then taste, or better, have someone taste them without knowing which is what (blind tasting)… Not a complicated experiment, but sure the best way to know. My bet is "1" and "2" will be considered almost the same, and eventually a bit more alcoholic than "3".&lt;br/&gt;And my proposition for an explanation is that in honey, there are other molecular chemicals that enhance the feeling of alcohol (ethanol) (other "-ol"s and esters…?).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;1 ounce equal to 29.57 ml which is close to 30 ml. Ounce being used to measure the liquid in USA. May be this practice has evolved to specify 1 peg for 1 oz.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I will try to answer your questions to the best of my ability.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your description of your earlier wine makes me question you: 
					Have you used a hydrometer to calculate the alcohol percentage of your earlier wines? &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If your wine tasted sweet after fermentation, it means your wine wasn't finished fermenting. If you bottle the wine and let it stay in room temperature with unfermented wine, then you may create bottle bombs.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparison between wild yeast and adding wine yeast:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration of Fermentation:&lt;/strong&gt; Naturally occurring wild yeast will use longer time than wine yeast. Adding Wine yeast is a lot faster, and will substantially reduce the fermentation time.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taste:&lt;/strong&gt; The taste is subjective, where wine yeast may create a safer and cleaner taste, meanwhile wild yeast and other bacteria may produce 'unwanted flavors' or 'wanted flavors'. Everything depends on what you want. I don't know enough about the specific tastes to tell you here.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol percentage:&lt;/strong&gt; I recommend using a hydrometer before and after fermentation to calculate the alcohol percentage of your wine. Adding wine yeast will eat up all the sugar in your wine very fast. 1-2 weeks, while wild yeast may use several months. Everything depends on how much yeast is present in the fermentation, temperature and how much sugar is in the unfermented wine.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wild yeast takes time to grow into a culture which can eat up all the sugar, where wine yeast usually already has ~1 billion cells in the package. &lt;/p&gt;
