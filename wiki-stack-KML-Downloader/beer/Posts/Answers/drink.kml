					&lt;p&gt;Before going on to this delicate question of drinking etiquette, please allow me to share a real experience, while flying with KLM. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, I witnessed a stewardess spill some wine one a lady's dress while on route to England. The &lt;strong&gt;first thing she did was apologize&lt;/strong&gt; and then got the head stewardess involved. The lady got her drink renewed on the spot, plus the airline gave her accommodations (hotel) at the airport to cleanup, have her clothes washed and dry cleaned, and so on, all on KLM's bill. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here are some commonsense rules to follow when you spill someone's drink over as follows, (if it is simply a question of spill a drink): &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;Avoid letting the situation happen in the first place&lt;/strong&gt;. You are most likely to spill someone's drink when you are making magnanimous gestures, carrying a few drinks of your own, or if you are feeling buzzed. So remember to be observant at these high risk moments. If you do spill someone's drink, do not ignore it, but act quickly to assess the situation and defuse any hostile vibrations. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;Apologize&lt;/strong&gt;. If you have just spilled someone's drink, you should apologize immediately and unreservedly. If they are a decent type, this should stop them from getting too agitated.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;3) &lt;strong&gt;Considering buying a replacement&lt;/strong&gt;. Have a look at the damage. If you have just knocked their drink out of their hands all over the floor, then you need to replace it immediately. If you've only knocked an ounce of beer or two from the top of their glass, then it shouldn't be a big deal. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Most people will be okay about it, and no replacement drink should be required. If they become confrontational, it would be best just to buy them a drink to save you the trouble. - 
					  &lt;a href="http://www.wikihow.com/React-when-You-Spill-Someone&amp;#39;s-Drink" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;How to React when You Spill Someone's Drink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You seem to be asking two questions, I'll try to answer both although a lot of this is conjecture:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Why are spirits in India poured in multiples of 30ml?&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is likely due to 30ml being easy to both measure out and to drink. 30 ml is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_glass#Sizes" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;pretty standard world-wide&lt;/a&gt; as a small or single measure, and multiplying a small measure (rather than have, say, 30ml followed by 50ml) makes things easy. 20ish g of pure alcohol (large peg) or 10g (small peg) is right in line with many countries' "standard drink"s (e.g. the UK "unit" is 8g, but a typical drink has between &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_alcohol" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;1 and 3 units&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Conceivably, the "peg" might be a semi-standardization of an old northern Indian unit of mass called the &lt;em&gt;chhatank&lt;/em&gt;, which appears to correspond roughly to 60g, but I think that's more likely a coincidence. 4 of them made up a &lt;em&gt;pao&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;pau&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;pav&lt;/em&gt; - but that's almost certainly a red herring and unconnected.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Where and when did this sense of the word &lt;em&gt;peg&lt;/em&gt; come from?&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Likely after and as a consequence of the British Raj. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;OED&lt;/a&gt;'s sense 12 of &lt;em&gt;peg&lt;/em&gt; is&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;colloq. (&lt;em&gt;orig.&lt;/em&gt; Anglo-Indian). &lt;em&gt;Originally: a drink of brandy and soda water. Later more generally: a (usually alcoholic) drink, esp. of spirits; a measure of spirits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The first usage they have is from John Camden Hotten's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dictionary_of_Modern_Slang,_Cant,_and_Vulgar_Words" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Dictionary of Modern Slang, Cant, and Vulgar Words&lt;/a&gt;. All the 19th Century quotations they have seem to refer the mixture of a spirit and something sparkling, mostly soda water. The only clearly Indian quotation they have is from 2003 and refers to the 30ml measure, but they're entirely lacking in quotations between 1939 and 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It seems possible that in turn this usage came from OED's sense 2b, which has quotations going back to 1617:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any of a set of pins fixed at intervals in a drinking vessel to indicate the quantity each drinker is to drink. Now&lt;/em&gt; hist.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But that connection is not made explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer can make you gain weight by three means, but you shall &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; pursue it !&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First&lt;/strong&gt; is alcohol, which is a byproduct of the fermentation of starch by yeast. Starch is a carbohydrate, and it has it's own nutriting quality, including energy. Its energy is transferred to alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the energy it carries is not used by basal metabolism or physical activity, it'll be stored. It is why non pathological drinker get fat. But drinking regularly may drive you to pathological drinking, even when you never get drunk nor make any excess.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second&lt;/strong&gt; is cereal malt (beer component) and non fermented starch itself : first is an aliment (cattle) and second is a carbohydrate : they are particularly fit for storing when unused.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third&lt;/strong&gt; is oestrogen. Hop, the flavouring and conservative plant used in beer production carries a phyto-oestrogen, which has the same effect on the human body as the feminine hormone. One of the effect of oestrogen is modifying the fat storage (many a women complain on her weight change under contraceptive pills), both for developing sexual character (women's are the sole primate with permanent breasts) and storing fat in case of starvation during pregnancy.
					You already guessed why messing with hormonal rates in your body is no option.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I strongly recommend you to seek help in gaining weight from a trained medical staff, or at least from a specialized Stack Exchange site. A change in your feeding habits may be way more efficient and less hazardous.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Basically, you must eat and brink more than your body burns, while making the right amount of physical exercise to gain muscles as well as body fat. Beer nutriment don't really matches the kind of food you shall seek with this objective.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sources: Wikipedia, French medical awareness websites, and my personal experience as a beer cellarman.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There were two types of drinks back in that time. Beer and Wine. Both hardly resembled what they are today. Beer was very weak, under 4% alcohol, while wine was probably in the normal range of 12-14%. Distilling had not been invented by the Muslims until 700 A.D. (anno Domini). If I apply Occam's Razor here, I would say that it's wine and probably a higher end wine because the more expensive wines were more alcoholic. As I mentioned in my other answer, you want to get your hands on some Retsina or that other Israeli wine being made in an ancient manner.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm adding the Wikipedia page on there about this exact passage.. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_in_the_Bible" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Alcohol in the Bible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"strong drink"; "denotes any inebriating drink with about 7–10 percent alcoholic content, not hard liquor, because there is no evidence of distilled liquor in ancient times.... It was made from either fruit and/or barley beer"; the term can include wine, but generally it is used in combination with it ("wine and strong drink") to encompass all varieties of intoxicants&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Surely mead, honey wine, should be considered. Okay, I had to google this one: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Wiki says&lt;/a&gt; that residual evidence has been found in northern Chinese pottery vessels dating from 6500–7000 BC, and in Europe in the ceramics of the Bell Beaker Culture (c. 2800–1800 BC). Wiki goes on to tell us that, contemporaneous to John the Baptist, Greeks and Romans were imbibing it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;The Quotation&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I shall examine the passage in the original Greek:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;ἔσται γὰρ μέγας ἐνώπιον τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ οἶνον καὶ σίκερα οὐ μὴ πίῃ, καὶ Πνεύματος Ἁγίου πλησθήσεται ἔτι ἐκ κοιλίας μητρὸς αὐτοῦ.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The two words we are intereted in here are 'οἶνον' ('wine'), and 'σίκερα' ('strong drink'). The second ('σίκερα') is interested in that it is a loan word directly from the Hebrew word 'שכר' (transliterated 'shekar'). This word is rather popular in the Old Testamant (appearing 7941 times), so it is little surprise that 'σίκερα' appears 4608 times in the New Testament. The two (in both languages) are usually used in conjunction with each other, to form the phrase 'wine and strong drink' to encompass the whole variety of intoxicants. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_in_the_Bible#Hebrew" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;The Wine&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wine was the ubiquitous alcoholic beverage of the ancient world. The process by which the ancient peoples made wine was simple. First, they pressed grapes into grape juice, then left the juice in large earthenware jars to ferment. Fermentation took two weeks to a month. Distillation had not yet been discovered, so Roman wine was of about the same strength as modern wine (around 13%), or possibly a bit stronger. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While 'true' Romans diluted their wine with water (roughly one part wine to two parts water), making it a beverage that could be drunk all day long, without danger of drunkenness, people living in provinces, such as Judea, are not supposed to have done so. That said, it is likely that the Roman officials did dilute their wine, in keeping with the custom back in Rome. Because of this, it is also likely that citizens wishing to curry their favour might also have adopted this custom. The Greeks also diluted their wine (roughly one part wine to four parts water). &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_alcoholic_drinks#Rome" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Other Alcohols&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Other alcohols included beer, which became significantly less popular than wine. In particular, wealthy Romans looked down on the drinking of beer. Tacitus (writing much later, in the 1st Century AD) wrote disparagingly of German beer. Barley wine (a type of strong ale, roughly 6-11%) existed, as well as alcohols made from whatever fruits might be growing in the vicinity. For example, when Caesar arrived in Britain in 55BC, he found the locals drinking an apple cider, a custom he and his men adopted with enthusiasm. &lt;a href="http://drinkfocus.com/beer/history-of-apple-cider/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have not be able to find any evidence for the consumption of distilled spirits or liqueurs.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Abstention&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Abstaining from alcohol was not as easy then as it might be now. Since a large proportion of running water was (and still is) undrinkable, ancient peoples turned to alcohol (in particular wine) as a daily staple, giving them the fluid they needed. The water mixed with wine would be (somewhat) sterilised, allowing it to be drunk, and making the wine go further. One assumes that John must have drunk water only, or at least non-alcoholic juices (grape, etc.). There is reference in the bible to non-alcoholic wines, although this is rare.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think you need something that is kind of big, but has the acid to cut through the goose fat and clear you palate when you take a sip. To that end I would suggest a Riesling, but not some whimpy sweet Riesling from Germany. I would suggest a really nice &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alsace_Grand_Cru_AOC" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Grand Cru Riesling from the Alsace&lt;/a&gt;. They have power to cut through the flavor, yet don't weigh you down like a big red wine. If you can find it, I suggest a Paul Blanck from Kayersburg. I visited them a few years back, wonderful wines!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a nod to my Canadian ancestry, both the French and Scot, I'd consider: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Wine: a red, such as Bordeaux, and it still makes the long Atlantic crossing in perfect condition&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Mulled wine: cinnamon, cloves, oranges, or Caribou with the extras tossed in&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Rum:  soldiers and their rations; a toddy or hot rum punch would go nicely&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Cider: Quebec, need I say more?&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Beer: spruce or ice beer, or selecting one from Molson, Sleeman or Labatt's (since the Jesuit's wouldn't share)&lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;OK, I am giving two answers to this after I thought about it. If you &lt;em&gt;REALLY&lt;/em&gt; want to stay super traditional to the spirit of the day and dig deep into your English roots, you would have some a nice &lt;a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pwp/tofi/medieval_english_ale.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;medieval beer&lt;/a&gt;, or nice &lt;a href="http://www.greydragon.org/library/13thCenturyMead.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Mead&lt;/a&gt; and/or some type of &lt;a href="http://www.archiveofciderpomology.co.uk/origins_of_cider.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;cider&lt;/a&gt;. Unless you were royalty, you wouldn't have access to wine from France.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;All of the above would be a great match for Goose.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Thought I would add my own answer to this fine list of excellent answers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Goose is, of course, stronger-flavoured than turkey - more like game but - crucially - quite a bit fattier which makes it essential in my book to look for a wine that has a fair level of acidity. It also tends to be accompanied by powerfully flavoured accompaniments such as chestnuts and red cabbage. Other traditional (and very good) accompaniments are potato or potato and apple stuffing, apples and prunes which can also affect your pairing:&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top quality German or Alsace Grand Cru Riesling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Probably the best match of all if you’re planning an apple or apple and prune stuffing. A dry spätlese Riesling would be ideal, cutting through the fat and providing a subtle touch of sweetness. The drawback is that your guests may well expect a red - but there’s no reason why you can’t serve both.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gewürztraminer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;A bolder choice still for Christmas. Obviously it’s not to everyone’s taste but if you serve a slightly spicy stuffing, especially one that contains dried fruits and/or ginger it would make a great match. Again look for a top quality wine with some intensity from Alsace or New Zealand which is making some great examples.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Probably the most likely wine to please your guests and certainly the one to choose if you’re going for red cabbage, sweet potatoes or other richly flavoured veg. I’d choose an example with some sweet, silky fruit rather than big tannins otherwise you may suffer from palate overload .&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And some beers to go with goose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Belgian Trappist beers such as Chimay or beers made in that style&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;These are just as good a match for goose as wine is if truth be told but there are, admittedly, likely to be fewer takers. No harm in having one or two available though. - &lt;a href="https://www.matchingfoodandwine.com/news/pairings/what-to-drink-with-goose/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;What to drink with goose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is what another site has to say about pairing drinks with goose:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The richness of goose demands a good wine, such as a top red Burgundy. However, it is often served with sweet side dishes, in which case a sweetish German Riesling might be a good option. In the mid-range, you could try a California Pinot Noir, a good red Rhône or an Australian Shiraz. - &lt;a href="http://www.williams-sonoma.com/recipe/tip/pairing-wine-with-meat-game-and-poultry.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Pairing Wine with Meat, Game and Poultry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If it is beer your into than here you go:  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dubbel&lt;/strong&gt; is also great with duck or goose. The rich and earthy flavor of these birds requires a beer with some heft to it and the dense, dried fruit flavor of dubbel recalls the dark berry sauces that are so commonly served with these birds.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doppelbock&lt;/strong&gt; offers another riff on this idea, offering strength and dark berry flavors amidst those of caramel, plums, and figs.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Beers to try: For Dubbel, look to the Chimay above, or grab a Rochefort 6 or Ommegang Abbey Ale. For Doppelbock, Ayinger's Celebrator and Weihenstephan's Korbinian are awesome, widely-available choices. - &lt;a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/12/beer-for-holiday-meal-pairing-prime-rib-ham-lamb-duck-christmas-dinner-beer.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Serious Eats Guide to Holiday Beer Pairing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for Vodka, how about trying some &lt;a href="https://www.greygoose.com/us/en/our-vodkas/our-vodkas.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Grey Goose Vodka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would go with what I call a &lt;strong&gt;"Bloody Juanita":&lt;/strong&gt; Tequila with Sangrita (tomato based).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For Mexican food, Tequila (or Mescal) is the obvious choice. You could go the US way and make some margaritas, but to me that sounds boring (and ideally needs a margarita machine, or at least decent amounts of ice, which is not always available, if you are on a boat or something).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sangrita is said to be a common partner to Tequila. According to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangrita" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;,:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Sangrita (meaning "little blood"), whose origin dates back to the 1920s, is a customary partner to a shot of straight tequila blanco; a non-alcoholic accompaniment that highlights tequila's crisp acidity and cleanses the palate between each peppery sip. The basic conception of sangrita is to complement the flavor of 100% agave tequila, which is also peppery and citrusy in taste.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Although originally it's a fruity juice, I would recommend the tomato-based variant as food companion.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;While most outsiders would reference its red make up as tomato juice and spices, locals and traditionalists agree that the one ingredient that most likely doesn't belong is tomato.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another thing to consider is the Tequila variant to use. Originally clear/silver is the way to go, but I prefer a brown/golden Tequila (can be a fake one, does not have a pricey barrel-aged one).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Mix Sangrita (store-bought or homemade, see linked Wikipedia article for recipes) and Tequila to taste and garnish with a big stem of cilantro, and there you go. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I don't know for certain but movies set in that time period and region seem to indicate mead was fairly popular and its ABV could be more than 20% according to wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Stronger beverages like Absinthe, Gin and Vodka do not seem to have been invented by then.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="http://www.alexreisner.com/misc/distilled-spirits" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;History and Taxonomy of Distilled Spirits&lt;/a&gt; There is ample evidence that distilled spirits were available during the time period you mentioned in a variety of places. We know that that Greek Alchemists developed the distillation processes about 1 AD and that a true distillation process was developed in Italy in the 1200s at the School of Salerno and Fractional Distillation was developed in the 1300s in Italy again. (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distilled_beverage" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Distilled Beverages Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;) In 1313 there is evidence that &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/origin-of-brandy/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Brandy&lt;/a&gt; had been made, although not widespread. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Then it seems in the 1400s, the doors open wide across Europe for distilled spirits.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Claims upon the origin of specific beverages are controversial, often
					  invoking national pride, but they are plausible after the 12th century
					  AD, when Irish whiskey and German brandy became available. These
					  spirits would have had a much lower alcohol content (about 40% ABV)
					  than the alchemists' pure distillations, and they were likely first
					  thought of as medicinal elixirs. Consumption of distilled beverages
					  rose dramatically in Europe in and after the mid-14th century, when
					  distilled liquors were commonly used as remedies for the Black Death.
					  Around 1400, methods to distill spirits from wheat, barley, and rye
					  beers, a cheaper option than grapes, were discovered. Thus began the
					  "national" drinks of Europe: jenever (Belgium and the Netherlands),
					  gin (England), Schnaps (Germany), grappa (Italy), borovička
					  (Slovakia), horilka (Ukraine), akvavit/snaps (Scandinavia), vodka
					  (Poland and Russia), ouzo (Greece), rakia (the Balkans), and poitín
					  (Ireland). The actual names emerged only in the 16th century, but the
					  drinks were well known prior to then. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, from about 500AD to 1300 AD, it was possible you could find distilled spirits, they were not widely available. Then in the 1300s distilled spirits spread across Europe and became widely available by the 1500s. Which one was actually the strongest? We'll never know but 90+% ABV was probably achievable with 1500s technology. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Why not try some orange wine. Pumpkins and pumpkin colored foods and drinks are often associated with Halloween.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.cookingchanneltv.com/2010/10/19/orange-wine-in-time-for-halloween/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Crushing: Orange Wines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;“That’s right: red, pink and white have company,” exclaimed a recent newsletter from the Chelsea Wine Vault. Laden with cartoony images of a wine glass filled with bright orange liquid and a grape vine dangling bright orange grapes, the newsletter featured an infamous, under-the-radar vino known as orange wine.  Save all judgment! Unlike gimmicky green beer sold on St. Pat’s Day, orange wine has a legitimate backstory…&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The practice of making orange wines, despite its relative anonymity, spans centuries, dating all the way back to Eurasian wine production in Georgia (and we’re not talking the Peachtree State here). Much of the orange wine that is commercially distributed today comes from Italy (specifically its northeastern Friuli region), but other producers include France, Germany and California.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From 'Indians of North America' by Harold Driver.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The distribution of alcoholic beverages falls almost wholly within the bounds of horticulture. However, there was a sizeable area in Northeast Mexico which was without agriculture and where wine was made from wild plants. For the world as a whole, there is a definite correlation between alcoholic beverages and agriculture, although negative instances can also be found in the Old World. The explanation is a simple one--the liquors were made principally from domesticated plants. It is commonly assumed either that knowledge of the fermenting of these plants spread with the plants or that the making of the liquor from the plant could spread only as far as the plant was known.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;e.g. Agave and Dasylirion -- Two distinct plants were widely used in the Southwest, Meso-America, and Northeast Mexico for the production of alcoholic beverages. They were even more widely used as food. It has been conjectured that before the time when agriculture was common, say, in the second or third millennium BC these plants were a staple food or even the staple food of a large part of the region. In the Southwest, the wine was usually made from the cooked juice of the agave, not from the fresh juice as in Meso-America.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So from this I'm going to infer that technologically most native tribes who knew of fermentation would have been restricted to that form of alcohol production, and so wine would be the only form of alcohol available pre-European contact. It's also safe to say that wine production only occurred within cultures that had ferment-able produce available to them.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Prior to 1492 Native Americans actually brewed various alcoholic drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Prior to contact with colonists, alcohol use and production was mainly concentrated in the southwestern United States. Some tribes produced weak beers, wine and other fermented beverages, but they had low alcohol concentrations (8%-14%) and were to be used only for ceremonial purposes. The distillation technique required to make stronger, potent forms of alcohol were unknown. It was well documented that Mexican Native Americans prepared over forty different alcoholic beverages from a variety of plant substances, such as honey, palm sap, wild plum, and pineapple. In the Southwestern U.S., the Papago, Piman, Apache and Maricopa all used the saguaro cactus to produce a wine, sometimes called haren a pitahaya. The Coahuiltecan in Texas combined mountain laurel with the Agave plant to create an alcoholic drink, and the Pueblos and Zunis were believed to have made fermented beverages from aloe, maguey, corn, prickly pear, pitahaya and even grapes. To the east, the Creek of Georgia and Cherokee of the Carolinas used berries and other fruits to make alcoholic beverages, and in the Northeast, there is some evidence that the Huron made a mild beer made from corn. In addition, despite the fact that they had little to no agriculture, both the Aleuts and Yuit of Alaska were believed to have made alcoholic drinks from fermented berries. - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_and_Native_Americans" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Alcohol and Native Americans (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Various Indian culture brewed different drinks according to what was available in the local areas.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;In Mexico, some believe Native Americans used a corn precursor to make a brewed drink; they note: “the ancestral grass of modern maize, teosinte, was well suited for making beer – but was much less so for making corn flour.” In addition, it is well established that Mexican Native Americans prepared “over forty different alcoholic beverages [from] . . . a variety of plant substances, such as honey, palm sap, wild plum, and pineapple.”&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;In the Southwestern U.S., the Papago, Piman, Apache and Maricopa all used the saguaro cactus to produce a wine, sometimes called haren a &lt;strong&gt;pitahaya&lt;/strong&gt;. Similarly, the Apache fermented corn to make &lt;strong&gt;tiswin&lt;/strong&gt; (also called tulpi and tulapai) and the yucca plant to make a different alcoholic beverage.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The Coahuiltecan in Texas combined mountain laurel with the Agave plant to create an alcoholic drink, and the Pueblos and Zunis were believed to have made fermented beverages from aloe, maguey, corn, prickly pear, pitahaya and even grapes.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;To the east, the Creek of Georgia and Cherokee of the Carolinas used berries and other fruits to make alcoholic beverages, and in the Northeast, “there is some evidence that the Huron made a mild beer made from corn.” In addition, despite the fact that they had little to no agriculture, both the Aleuts and Yuit of Alaska were believed to have made alcoholic drinks from fermented berries.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;It should be noted, however, that most of these beverages were relatively weak, presumably no stronger than wine (which typically runs from 8-14% ABV). Whiskey, on the other hand, is usually 60% ABV, and grain alcohol (e.g., moonshine) is often 95% ABV. As a result, when Europeans introduced these stronger drinks, Native Americans were in for a shock. - &lt;a href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/11/native-americans-introduced-alcohol-europeans/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Native Americans Were Not Introduced to Alcohol By Europeans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Pueblo Indians actually brewed their own brand of &lt;strong&gt;corn beer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Ancient Pueblo Indians brewed their own brand of corn beer, a new study suggests, contradicting claims that the group remained dry until their first meeting with the Europeans. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Archaeologists recently found that 800-year-old potsherds belonging to the Pueblos of the American Southwest contained bits of fermented residue typical in beer production. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Before the discovery, historians thought a pocket of Pueblos in New Mexico did not have alcohol at all, despite being surrounded by other beer-making tribes, until the Spanish arrived with grapes and wine in the 16th century.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;A thousand years ago, traditional Native American farming villages were already scattered across parts of New Mexico, Arizona and northern Mexico, divided among several tribes including the Apache, Pueblo, Navajo and the Tarahumara. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Many of the tribes living in Mexico and some in Arizona are known to have produced a weak beer called tiswin, made by fermenting kernels of corn, but no evidence has ever been found that the same thing happened in New Mexico. - &lt;a href="http://www.livescience.com/4770-beer-brewed-long-native-americans.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Beer Brewed Long Ago by Native Americans&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you include Central and South America, there is a beverage that is still made today called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicha" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Chicha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;In South and Central America, chicha is a fermented or non-fermented beverage usually derived from maize.&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicha" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;[need quotation to verify] Chicha includes corn beer known as chicha de jora and non-alcoholic beverages such as chicha morada. Archaeobotanists have found evidence for chicha made from maize, the fruit of Schinus molle and Prosopis pods.&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauim" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; Chichas can also be made from quinoa, kañiwa, peanut, manioc root (also called yuca or cassava), palm fruit, potato, Oxalis tuberosa, chañar or various other fruits.&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauim" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;
					  While chicha is most commonly associated with maize, the word is used in the Andes for almost any homemade fermented drink, and many unfermented drinks.[3] Many different maize landraces, grains or fruits have been and can be used to make chicha in different regions.&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauim" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; The way in which chicha is made and defined is likely to change depending on the region[4]&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is a native Brazilian drink called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauim" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Cauim&lt;/a&gt; made from Manioc root:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Cauim preparation (like other cooking tasks) is strictly a women's job, with no involvement from the men. Manioc roots are sliced thin, boiled until tender, and allowed to cool down. Then women and girls gather around the pot; each repeatedly takes a mouthful of manioc, chews it, and puts it into a second pot (depending on the culture). Enzymes in the saliva then convert the starch into fermentable sugars. (Men firmly believe that if they were to chew the paste, the resulting beverage would not taste as good; and anyway they consider that work as inappropriate for them as spinning yarn would be for European men.) The chewed root paste is put back on the fire and stirred with a wooden spoon until completely cooked. The paste is then allowed to ferment in large earthenware pots ("half as big as a Burgundy wine barrel").&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are more, but these are probably the most well known from South America.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Why not try this  chillischnaps liquor: Kehlenschneider. It has an 80% ABV and is a real evil drink if taken in untamed quantities! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Kehlenschneider is of German origin and means &lt;strong&gt;throat slicer&lt;/strong&gt; and some say it is the hottest liquor/liqueur in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A very interesting one is &lt;a href="https://www.ciroc.com/vodkas/peach" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Ciroc Peach&lt;/a&gt; with 7-Up/Sprite. Tastes like fuzzy peach juice. You can mix 7-Up/Sprite with any of the other flavors of Cioc(or any flavored vodka if we generalize) but I find Peach the best for my personal tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you want something sweet you can try &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;amaretto and coke (&lt;a href="http://cocktails.lovetoknow.com/amaretto-coke" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;some more detailed information)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					for an even sweeter experience you can even go for a mix with Dr pepper &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It has a slimier taste to a bakewell tart so it is recommended if you like sweet things &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My favorite Hi Ball of all Time is Vernor's(an obscure, potent ginger all type soda) and whiskey.  Two powerful flavors that manage to keep their potency while still blending very well. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a general rule for all of these Using a 12oz glass, I would pour 1.5 oz of liquor with 4.5oz soda directly over ice- stir gently.  Drink with a full sized straw.  Garnish with lime, orange, cherry, or lemon as appropriate.&lt;/em&gt; (The straw may seem unimportant, but in fact it creates a different experience than a sip straw or no straw)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're into sweet things I recommend Tuaca and Cream Soda (Jones' is my favorite for this).  Tuaca is 80 proof and is sort of a Vanilla and Orange Liquor with butterscotch after notes.  It's sweetness blends well into soda(also Vernor's as above, coke, orange soda, etc..) and very efficiently hides the alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some traditional Hi-Balls:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Vodka with Soda Water and Lime: Descriptive words: Strong, simple, skinny, diet, crisp&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Spiced Rum and Coke- Quite different from a cuba libre.  Descriptive words: Sweet, easy, deceptive, spiced, flavorful&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Vodka and Tonic and Lime: Descriptive words: Strong, simple, skinny, diet, potent, blunt, Quinine&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Jack Daniels and Ginger: Descriptive words: Sweet, Bright, Easy, Traditional&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Scotch and Soda (The original Hi-Ball): Descriptive words: Traditional, potent, slow-sipping&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some non-traditional quick combos:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Cake Vodka and Coke: Descriptive words: Soda Shop, Sweet, Vanilla Coke, Rich&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Whipped Cream Vodka and Orange Soda: Descriptive words: dessert, old-fashioned, soda shop, masked alcohol, deceptively strong&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Pear or Apple Vodka and Sparkling Apple Juice:  Descriptive words: Apple Pie, Crisp, Sweet, Refreshing&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skinny Bitch&lt;/strong&gt; - Vodka and Diet Coke: Descriptive words: Diet, skinny, easy&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dirty Shirley&lt;/strong&gt; - Vodka (or cherry vodka) Ginger Ale (or Sprite) and grenadine(3/4 oz):  Descriptive words: Sweet, fun, masked alcohol, deceptively strong, bubbly&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double O-7&lt;/strong&gt; - Orange Vodka/ lemon vodka orange slice or splash of OJ mixed with 7/up sprite :  Descriptive words: Crisp, lively, effervescent, citrus, refreshing, bubbly&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swamp Juice&lt;/strong&gt; (Named for color of beverage) - Mountain Dew and Captain Spiced Rum: Descriptive words: Energizing, sharp, citrus&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Try &lt;strong&gt;Red Wine and Coke&lt;/strong&gt;. And do not forget the ice... It is great one hot days.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Turns out this is quite a hit in most of Europe already. Who would have thought that red wine and coke would go this well together? It is coke with a grape twist and its taste killer. - &lt;a href="http://ca.askmen.com/recess/recommended/best-soda-and-alcohol-combinations-4.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Red Wine and Coke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Of course there are! 'associated with' allows for a great deal of latitude. In fact, just in beer itself, there are several beers that are associated with, but not directly a result of, religious customs.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Lenten beers are an entire category in and of themselves, but since you don't really want to  hear about the giant selection of Bocks and their variety of flavors and the rich history therein, we'll skip those for now.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://oldliquorsmagazine.com/whisky-water-of-life/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Whisky&lt;/a&gt; as indicated here has been associated with religious rites.
					&lt;a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bos/bos589.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Mead&lt;/a&gt; has been associated with various rituals, mostly from the Scandinavian regions. Some of these rites and rituals are so ubiquitous that it's fairly common to hear people ascribe the origin of the phrase 'honeymoon' to drinking mead.
					&lt;a href="https://www.chartreuse.fr/en/histoire/the-chartreuse-distilleries/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Chartreuse&lt;/a&gt;, 'the only liquor so good they named a color after it', is brewed by Carthusian monks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These are just a few examples; some others, besides beer, wine, whisky, mead and chartreuse, include;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;ayahuasca, which isn't specifically brewed to be alcoholic, but tends to be stored and fermented&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;kefir, which is technically haram, forbidden in islam, but definitely does get fermented&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.etonline.com/news/149897_andrew_keegan_starts_his_own_religion/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;kombucha,&lt;/a&gt; if you want something fun, which typically isn't part of a traditional religion (that I know of), but read the article. It's pretty funny.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of interrelation between alcohol and religion, because yeast has been around for a long time, and so have various religions. Dig deep enough, you'll hit a religion that uses the drink.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Whisky and wakes were written about in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;James Joyce&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnegans_Wake" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Finnegans Wake&lt;/a&gt; as well as being sung about by the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubliners" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Dubliners&lt;/a&gt;.

					&lt;p&gt;The world of Harry Potter has spawned an entire universe of beverages, both with and without alcohol, including those served at Universal Studios theme parks, and many independently-inspired creations.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Eater Miami describes &lt;a href="https://miami.eater.com/2016/5/27/11697900/harry-potter-wizarding-world-orlando-florida-butterbeer" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Everything You Need to Eat and Drink at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter&lt;/a&gt; by Olee Fowler (May 27, 2016) (emphasis added).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Alcoholic&lt;/strong&gt;: Just as the food remains true to the books and the setting, so do the drinks. The real star of the area is the famous Butterbeer and can be found roughly every 20 feet inside both parks. &lt;strong&gt;Butterbeer&lt;/strong&gt; is a butterscotch meets caramel meets cream soda flavored drink. It’s offered in regular form, frozen and even hot for the few days out of the year it drops below 70 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Almost as popular as the butterbeer is the &lt;strong&gt;Pumpkin Juice&lt;/strong&gt;, which is combination of pineapple and apple juices mixed with pumpkin spice flavoring, and tastes like fall in a cup. Diagon Alley also features the almost neon-bright &lt;strong&gt;Fishy Green Ale&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a mash up of mint and cinnamon with blueberry flavored pearls akin to boba at the bottom. Then there is the twist on lemonade called &lt;strong&gt;Tongue Tying Lemon Squash&lt;/strong&gt;, a fizzy orange concoction known as the &lt;strong&gt;Otter’s Fizzy Juice&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Peachtree Fizzing Tea&lt;/strong&gt;, an unsweetened ice tea.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcoholic&lt;/strong&gt;: But we know what you’re really thinking — what about the booze? Unlike its theme park counterpart Disney World down the street, all Universal parks allow alcohol on-site. Both Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley serve two &lt;strong&gt;proprietary beers&lt;/strong&gt;: the dark, malt-heavy porter known as &lt;strong&gt;Wizard’s Brew&lt;/strong&gt; and the lighter lager-style &lt;strong&gt;Dragon Scale beer&lt;/strong&gt;, both created by the Florida Beer Brewing Company.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Adjacent to Three Broomsticks is Hog’s Head Pub is the only bar in the two worlds, which is a bit grim and dark in keeping with the theme of the books. The highlight of the menu is the pub’s own &lt;strong&gt;Fire Whiskey&lt;/strong&gt;, which is its take on cinnamon-flavored Fireball. It also happens to pair well with the Butterbeer. No sodas can be found in Hog’s Head, but there are a few specialty drinks like &lt;strong&gt;Hog’s Tea&lt;/strong&gt;, a Long Island iced tea riff and the strongest drink on the menu, and the &lt;strong&gt;Pear Dazzle&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a mix of vodka and pear cider.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And a recipe sampling from the BuzzFeed article on &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/rachelysanders/harry-potter-and-the-night-he-wont-remember?utm_term=.ryzk5eb9Nm#.dr2Ep12qVw" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;8 Magical And Delicious Harry Potter Cocktails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unicorn Blood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					  1.5 oz silver tequila&lt;br&gt;
					  1.5 oz St. Germain (elderflower liqueur)&lt;br&gt;
					  1 oz lemon juice&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Add everything to a cocktail shaker with ice and shake (hard!) for a full 20 seconds. Strain into a coupe glass. Serves 1.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hair Of The Three-Headed Dog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					  1.5 oz tequila&lt;br&gt;
					  1/2 cup tomato juice&lt;br&gt;
					  1 tablespoon lime juice&lt;br&gt;
					  1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce&lt;br&gt;
					  1 teaspoon Tabasco&lt;br&gt;
					  1 12-oz bottle Mexican beer (like Corona or Modelo)&lt;br&gt;
					  2 tablespoons kosher salt &lt;br&gt;
					  1/2 teaspoon chili powder&lt;br&gt;
					  1 celery stalk, washed, root end trimmed (optional)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Mix tequila, tomato juice, lime juice, Worcestershire and Tabasco sauces. Mix salt and chili powder together in a small bowl or saucer. Rub the rim of a pint glass with a slice of lime and roll the outside of the glass rim in the chili salt to coat it. Fill glass halfway with ice, add tomato mixture, stir well, and top with beer. Garnish with celery if you like. Serves 1.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wolfsbane Potion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					  1.5 oz Scotch whiskey&lt;br&gt;
					  1.5 oz Fernet-Branca
					  Coca-Cola&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Combine Scott and Fernet in a shaker with ice and stir vigorously for 20 seconds, until fully chilled. Strain into a rocks glass with a large ice cube. Top with cola, to taste. Serves 1.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Phoenix Feather&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					  2 oz Lillet Blanc&lt;br&gt;
					  1.5 oz Campari&lt;br&gt;
					  1 oz fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice&lt;br&gt;
					  seltzer or club soda&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Combine Lillet, Campari, and grapefruit juice in a cocktail shaker with ice and shake, vigorously, for about 20 seconds. Strain into a Collins glass filled with ice cubes and top with seltzer. Serves 1.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Butterbeer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					  6-8 tablespoons butterscotch sauce (depending how sweet you like it)&lt;br&gt;
					  3 cups apple cider&lt;br&gt;
					  1 cup bourbon whiskey (optional)&lt;br&gt;
					  2 cups ginger beer&lt;br&gt;
					  Whipped cream, for garnish&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Heat cider, bourbon and butterscotch syrup in a medium saucepan until the butterscotch dissolves and the mixture is steaming hot. Remove from heat and stir in the ginger beer. Ladle into mugs and serve with loads of whipped cream on top. Serves 6-8.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polyjuice Potion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					  1.5 oz gin&lt;br&gt;
					  1.5 oz fresh-pressed or bottled green juice&lt;br&gt;
					  1 oz green Chartreuse&lt;br&gt;
					  ½ oz lime juice&lt;br&gt;
					  7-Up or Sprite (optional)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Shake gin, juices, and Chartreuse in a shaker with ice. Strain into a glass (you can serve up or over ice) and top with a splash of soda if you'd like it a little lighter. Serves 1.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Felix Felicis ("Liquid Luck")&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					  1/4 oz simple syrup&lt;br&gt;
					  1/4 oz lemon juice&lt;br&gt;
					  1.5 oz ginger beer&lt;br&gt;
					  Champagne or other sparkling wine&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Mix simple syrup and lemon juice in the bottom of a champagne flute. Add ginger beer and fill with Champagne. Serves 1.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amortentia Love Potion Punch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					  For ice ring:&lt;br&gt;
					  1 pint fresh red raspberries&lt;br&gt;
					  1 cup fresh pomegranate seeds&lt;br&gt;
					  4 cups water, boiled and cooled&lt;br&gt;
					  ice cubes&lt;br&gt;
					  For punch:&lt;br&gt;
					  1 750-ml bottle Aperol&lt;br&gt;
					  4 cups pomegranate juice&lt;br&gt;
					  2 cups gin&lt;br&gt;
					  2 750-ml bottles chilled rosé sparkling wine&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Spread raspberries and pomegranate seeds in the bottom of a bundt or ring cake pan. Cover fruit with a layer of ice cubes to keep it in place and pour enough boiled water over to just cover the ice (you don't need to use all the water). Freeze overnight. Mix Aperol, pomegranate juice, and gin together in a large punch bowl. When you're ready to serve the punch, add sparkling wine and stir gently. Float the ice ring on top. Serves about 20.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In general beer is not considered healthy.  In excess it is definitely not healthy.  Alcohol is hard on the liver.  Alcohol withdrawal has the highest death rate. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Up to 2 beers a day is generally considered a maximum intake.  You would pick up like 300 calories.  There are better ways to pick up 300 calories. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One pound can be gained through the consumption of about 3500 calories more than you burn.  If you drink a brand of beer with 200 calories per serving, it'd take 18 servings to gain a pound (assuming your diet otherwise negates your metabolism).  That pound, likely, would be fat.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I don't think you really want to do this, as enjoyable as you may find beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I’m not familiar with pisco but whatever ingredient is cooking the egg(citrus juice I’d think) needs to be separate when shaking and added afterwords.  It may be already in the glass that you pour the cocktail but finding a bartender that makes them often enough will usually be willing to show you the steps.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Several suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;On a fresh egg, remove the chalazae, the ropey bit in the white (it anchors the yolk);&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Use either pasteurized egg whites or powdered egg whites;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Add ice only after the mixture has become foamy and voluminous;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Use a finer mesh strainer (if bits are getting through your shaker strainer).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Chicago bartender here. Try adding your egg whites to one half of the shaker and your pisco and citrus to the other. Dry shake first. Then add ice and shake for 20 seconds. Double strain through a mesh strainer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The use of brown sugar in Europe must give the cachaça a taste of sugarcane. Industrially produced cachaça often doesn't have it. The problem is that brown sugar can be made of beta and it doesn't have taste of sigarcane either. And it dissolves slower than white sugar so the drink becomes sweet when it's almost finished.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's a good question, maybe an answer is on the fact the white sugar in Europe is not producted with cane but beet or other source. In Brazil white sugar used in caipirinha is made with cane.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Infact there is a big difference when used brown sugar. 
					Crushed ice is not a good option because it dissolve too fast and the caipirinha became a lemon juice.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;sadly don't have a link for this, but had a tasting locally put on by a rep from Pierde Almas.   the way we were directed for a "traditional" drinking was in a snifter and served at room temp.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;He said that you should always start a drink with a deep smell.  to keep your mouth closed and you breathe in the scent, and then open it while taking this breathe so that you go from smelling to tasting the aromas. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You then take sips and let it sit in your mouth for about 10 seconds while you exhale slowly through your nose.   and that as you keep doing this, you will start to smell and taste all the Mezcal has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;again, I don't have any links for this.  just what I was told in person by the Rep.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;1 ounce equal to 29.57 ml which is close to 30 ml. Ounce being used to measure the liquid in USA. May be this practice has evolved to specify 1 peg for 1 oz.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First of all mezcal does not contain a worm, it's a hollywood misconception and if you ever find one do not drink it&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The average way to drink mezcal is just raw but there are other ways to drink it&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Salt or chilli powder around the edge of the caballito (the tiny glass)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Drops of lemon&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Mixed with grapefuit soda&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Mixed with mineral water&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Blue gatorade mixed with coconut cream (we call it pitufo or smurf)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Pomegranate glucose syrup and ginger beer with ice&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;and a couple of others I don't remember but these are the average ways to drink mezcal&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As you said, many of the traditions like salt &amp;amp; lime are primarily used to disguise low-quality tequila and mezcal. If you're buying a reposado, añejo, or aged mezcal, you'll want to get the full aroma and flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The colder the drink, the less aroma you get. Room temperature is recommended by most distilleries. Using a snifter glass, as Jedicurt suggested, lets you warm the liquor a bit more with your body temperature, which releases even more of the aromatics.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While I certainly know a lot of tequila and mezcal drinkers that add ice to their drinks -- I've been known to do it myself -- we'll generally add a single ice cube &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; taking that first big whiff to experience the aroma.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While there are mezcals that have the "worm" (it's actually a caterpillar or larva) in the bottle, they're generally the ones you want to avoid if you're drinking for flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
