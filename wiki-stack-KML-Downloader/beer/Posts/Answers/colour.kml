					&lt;p&gt;In a Half and Half (also known as a "Black and Tan" in certain locations), the primary factor will be the density of the two beers -- one beer &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_and_Tan#Preparation"&gt;must be of a lesser density&lt;/a&gt; than the other to stay afloat.  Contrasting colors are used for visual effect; otherwise, how might you know one was floating?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Common recipes involve floating the less dense Guinness over a Bass, or a Guinness over a Harp Lager.  Its Guinness' particular light density that makes it a good candidate for so many half-and-half style recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally when creating a "Half and Half", Guiness is the only constant.  The other beer is usually something only lighter in color.  Wheat beers have an interesting flavor.  IPA's have their bitterness cut when made into a Half and Half.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, I will sometimes select the beer so that the drink gets an awesome name:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Black and Blue - Guiness w/ Labatt Blue&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Black Sunset - Guiness w/ Leinie's Sunset Wheat&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Black Cow - Guiness w/ New Glarus Spotted Cow&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think it all depends on your personal preference. There are many different combinations out there such as the Black and Tan, but some companies have also started coming out with six packs that they intend for you to mix. Shock Top, for example, released a six pack that featured their Chocolate Wheat and their Belgium White. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What I would do is think of a dark beer you enjoy and then a lighter (but still flavorful beer) that you like and just experiment with mixing them. In my case I would choose to mix Left Hand Milk Stout and a Kentucky Kolsch. Let me know what you try! I am curious! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A half and half is a Guinness with Harp. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This style of beer combination is accomplished by using a dense beer on the bottom followed by a beer of lesser density on the top (usually poured over a spoon to ensure that it doesn't sink through).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Essentially it is usually an ale or lager underneath a stout. Some popular versions and combinations include&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The Trinity&lt;br&gt;
					Guinness, Smithwicks, Harp&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Blacksmith&lt;br&gt;
					Guinness &amp;amp; Smithwick’s Irish Ale&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Black &amp;amp; Black&lt;br&gt;
					Guinness &amp;amp; Guinness Stout&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Black Pyramid&lt;br&gt;
					Guinness &amp;amp; Pyramid&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Black &amp;amp; Gold&lt;br&gt;
					Guinness &amp;amp; Magner’s Cider&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Black &amp;amp; Red&lt;br&gt;
					Guinness &amp;amp; Killian’s Irish Red&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Black &amp;amp; Sam&lt;br&gt;
					Guinness &amp;amp; Sam Adams&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Black &amp;amp; Fire&lt;br&gt;
					Guinness &amp;amp; Firestone&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Black Coffee&lt;br&gt;
					Guinness &amp;amp; Black Butte Porter&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Eclipse&lt;br&gt;
					Guinness &amp;amp; Blue Moon&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Black Castle&lt;br&gt;
					Guinness &amp;amp; Newcastle&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Black on Blonde&lt;br&gt;
					Guinness &amp;amp; Stella Artois&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Black Tire&lt;br&gt;
					Guinness &amp;amp; Fat Tire&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Black Torpedo&lt;br&gt;
					Guinness &amp;amp; Sierra Nevada&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Dark &amp;amp; Steamy&lt;br&gt;
					Guinness &amp;amp; Anchor Steam&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Irish American&lt;br&gt;
					Guinness &amp;amp; Budweiser&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The Noogie&lt;br&gt;
					Guinness &amp;amp; Pabst Blue Ribbon&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Half &amp;amp; Half&lt;br&gt;
					Guinness &amp;amp; Harp&lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you follow the information trail through Wikipedia's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stout"&gt;page about Stout beer&lt;/a&gt;, you find that what was known as Stout became a strong, dark beer in the 1800s:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;In the 19th century, the beer gained its customary black colour through the use of black patent malt, and became stronger in flavour.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can see from the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mash_ingredients#Black_malt"&gt;article about mash ingredients&lt;/a&gt; that black patent malt is "barley malt that has been kilned to the point of carbonizing, around 200 °C." It is apparently called "patent" malt because the inventor was awarded a patent for it. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, this malt is used to darken the colour of other beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You're right - is the high kilning temperatures used in the malt that give it a dark color. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Note that not all Stouts use black patent malt - some use roasted unmalted barley, most famously, Guinness, which uses 18% roasted barley in the recipe (IIRC from my trip to the brewery.) If you look through a pint of Guinness, you'll see that it's not simply jet black, but in fact fairly clear, and the light will give ruby highlights to the beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Guinness isn't the only dark beer to layer with. Porters can be used to as a bottom layer to give you a dark-on-bottom drink.  Check it all out at &lt;a href="http://www.theperfectblackandtan.com/blog" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Perfect Black and Tan.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is more than color.  You need the other beer to have a different density from Guinness, at least if you want it to stay separated for any length of time. And be careful which Guinness you use because there are a number of them out there with different "strengths".  If the densities are too close, they'll mix together.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A good starting point in selecting interesting combinations is to look at the &lt;a href="http://www.brewersfriend.com/2009/02/04/beer-styles-original-gravity-and-final-gravity-chart/" rel="nofollow"&gt;densities across different styles&lt;/a&gt;.  Pick two that are widely different and find bottles of each.  For instance, if you take a bottle of a kriek (red-looking fruit lambic), it would probably float nicely on most other beers, but you'd want to pick a nice, dark beer to show off the contrast (plus, if you used a kriek (cherry) or frambois (raspberry), pairing it with a porter or stout that has nice chocolate tones would taste very nice).  Likewise, just about anything would float on a bock or a strong scotch ale like a "wee heavy".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In Dutch the names mean double and triple, they originated at the Belgian Westmalle abbey brewery where the double was a strong brown ale. Their tripel was the name they gave to their strongest beer, a blonde pale ale.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These beers quickly became popular and were imitated worldwide as were their names. The convention now is as following, a dubbel is a strong (6%-8% abv) dark ale, a tripel is a strong pale ale in the style of Westmalle tripel (9.5%). A quadrupel is an ale stronger than a tripel (+10%) but beyond that there is no real agreement on what it should be. Westvleteren 12 is an example of a quadrupel.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Color tends to come primarily from the malt bill used (darker roasted malts lending darker color to a beer).  In the case of Belgian beers, a "candi" sugar (derived from beets) may used as an additive, and different styles use different types of candi sugars.  For dubbels in particular, the candi is a darker variety, made with a (more) substantial dose of molasses, which would darken the beer further.  A tripel uses a candi with less molasses.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"Green" refers to the flavor of the beer. Under-matured beer can have a green apple aroma called Acetaldehyde. IT is reduced by yeast in the maturation phase. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'll take a stab at this... Absinthe is an unregulated name unlike something like Champagne which is highly regulated name/place. With Champagne you can only use Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay in making it and it has to be grown in the Champagne region. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Absinthe can be made by any distiller anywhere in the world. What that means is that you could put whatever you want into a bottle and call it Absinthe (within liquor regulations). True that traditional Absinthe is a green color, from wormwood, but using other herbs or plants could change it a different color. But a quick look around the web yielded several wildly colored examples called Absinthe. So, if it bugs you, only drink green Absinthe and ignore the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Clear Absinthe&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Absinthe is made much in the same way that many gins are.  You take neutral spirits, add botanicals (wormwood and anise), and re-distill.  Anything that comes out of the still will be clear.  Some absinthes at this point are finished, these will be called blanche (white) or sometime la bleue.  The first absinthe available in Val-de-Travers (the birthplace of absinthe) after the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/04/world/europe/rebirth-of-the-potion-that-made-valdetravers-famous.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;ban in Switzerland was lifted&lt;/a&gt; was a blanche.  That same bottling was the driving force behind making it legal in the United States &lt;a href="http://www.bevlaw.com/absintheinamerica/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;(interview of lawyer who fought the ban)&lt;/a&gt;.  It can be really good stuff.  Any of these can be really easily colored.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Green Absinthe&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Usually absinthe gets a second chance to mingle (macerate) with some herbs after it's sprung from the still, this style is known at verte.  This is when it gets it's color, as well as some extra flavor and aroma. It's a more complex flavor.  The color that the chlorophyll imparts is dull.  If it's neon green there was &lt;a href="http://realabsinthe.blogspot.com/2011/06/what-makes-green-fairy-green.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;food coloring added&lt;/a&gt; and some of these "greener" varieties are actually blanche at heart.  Also of note is that sometimes these food colored types add sugar, to make it friendlier to less experienced drinkers (or to hide poor distillation technique as happens with vodka).  There is at least &lt;a href="https://www.absinthes.com/absinthe-adnams-rouge-p935" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;one non-green bottling&lt;/a&gt; that I know of that is still macerated post distillation, but uses hibiscus which turns it red.  These methods of coloration don't make them any less of a true absinthe, they do use wormwood (and equally important, anise).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Czech Absinth (without the e)&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The most common non-green "absinthe" is so called Czech-style, also known as Bohemian style.  These are &lt;a href="http://wormwoodsociety.org/index.php/general-information-education-214/39-whats-wrong-with-bohemian-qstyleq-absinth" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;not rightly called absinthe&lt;/a&gt; and are historically known for very low quality.  Instead of distilling the botanicals in the alcohol, they are cold compounded.  It's made either by mixing spirits, flavoring oils, and food coloring or by macerating the botanicals without distillation.  Be wary of absinthes &lt;a href="https://www.diffordsguide.com/encyclopedia/275/bws/absinthe-how-is-absinthe-made" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;much over 140 proof&lt;/a&gt;, as they are frequently Czech-style.  Do be aware that they're called Czech-style because that's where the style originated and where most of this variety still comes from, however the Czech Republic does have &lt;a href="http://www.praguepost.com/articles/2006/04/26/worthy-of-their-name.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;good examples of absinthe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am going to put my two bits into this question also.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are several existing colored absinthe on the market at the moment and a couple of ways to get various colored varieties. Artificial coloring is the most common.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Absinthe may be found in the following colors: &lt;strong&gt;Green, Red (or Rose), Yellow, Brown, Clear and Blue.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One way to get the desired colored is to make your own absinthe as can be seen in the following recipe. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Put the dry herbs in a large jar. Dampen slightly. Add 800 milliliters of 85-95 percent alcohol. Wine spirits make a better product than pure grain alcohol. Let steep for several days - a week is better - shaking occasion absinthe. Then add 600 milliliters of water and let the whole macerate for another day. Decant off the liquid squeezing as much from the mass of herb as possible. Wet the herbs with some vodka and squeeze again. Recipe should give a little over a liter and a half of green liquor. It must then be distilled... - &lt;a href="http://absinthe.msjekyll.com/recipe.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Traditional absinthe recipe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There or other non-traditional herbs and artificial coloring agents that are used to make a particular color also.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Absinthe can be classified differently&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;By color:&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Green absinthe – classically natural color of absinthe. Color can vary from deep emerald to light green or olive shade. Practically every manufacturer produces green absinthe. &lt;strong&gt;But because the natural dye (chlorophyll from the leaves) is not durable therefore manufacturers in most cases use artificial coloring.&lt;/strong&gt; To preserve natural green color of absinthe it is bottle in green or brown bottles. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Yellow absinthe – is usually natural colored because natural dye from chlorophyll has a tendency to lose its color and become more yellowish in couple of months after production (aging of absinthe). &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Red absinthe – is colored by extract of pomegranate or macerated with blossoms of hibiscus what gives absinthe light-ruby shade and original after-taste. But nowadays majority of red absinthes are artificially colored. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Brown absinthe – unlike all the other absinthes this kind is macerated with the roots of wormwood not the leaves of blossoms. Also dark color can be achieved by adding black cutch extract which brings slight flavour of berries. - &lt;a href="http://absinthe-time.eu/EN/menu/kinds-of-absinthe" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Kinds of Absinthe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia has this to say about absinthe:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Absinthe may also be naturally coloured pink or red using rose or hibiscus flowers. This was referred to as a &lt;strong&gt;rose&lt;/strong&gt; (pink) or &lt;strong&gt;rouge&lt;/strong&gt; (red) absinthe. Only one historical brand of rose absinthe has been documented.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Many contemporary absinthe critics simply classify absinthe as distilled or mixed, according to its production method. And while the former is generally considered far superior in quality to the latter, an absinthe's simple claim of being 'distilled' makes no guarantee as to the quality of its base ingredients or the skill of its maker.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blanche&lt;/strong&gt;, or la Bleue: Blanche absinthe (also referred to as la Bleue in Switzerland) is bottled directly following distillation and reduction, and is uncoloured (clear). The name la Bleue was originally a term used for bootleg Swiss absinthe, but has become a popular term for post-ban-style Swiss absinthe in general.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As noted in &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/a/6410/5064"&gt;Montijello's excellent answer&lt;/a&gt;, clear absinthe may be easily artificially colored.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of Clear Absinthes on the market as can be seen on the following website:&lt;/p&gt;

					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.absinthes.com/en/clear-absinthe-s328" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Clear Absinthe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;This is usually the favourite of people trying absinthe for the first time, and of the most experience absintheurs: where absinthe drinkers settle again in the end, having explored the world of green absinthe. Quite simply because it is balanced and delicious. Much of the finest absinthe is clear. Also known as Blanche, La Bleue, and white absinthe...&lt;/p&gt;
