					&lt;p&gt;Widgetized beers are packaged with liquid nitrogen, and the widget, which contains a small hole. The liquid nitrogen warms, turns to a gas inside the sealed can, which forces gas and beer into the widget through the hole. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When the can is opened, the pressure inside drops suddenly, causing the contents of the widget to be shot into the beer, agitating the beer, producing the foam. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If this were tried with a regularly carbonated beer, you'd end up with foam erupting out of the can. Hence, beers packaged with a widget have only about 1/3 the carbon dioxide dissolved than regular beers, plus the nitrogen, which creates a smooth mouthfeel and dense foam. Due to the requirements of reduced carbon-dioxide, the widget is used almost exclusively with Stouts, Bitters and Irish Red ales - styles that can be served with lower volumes of carbon-dioxide. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;see&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Cans should be okay in the freezer for a long time, however they will probably dent outward as the water freezes.  Bottles will pop the cap since that is the weakest part of the container.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;All that being said, the quality of the beer may deteriorate from being frozen as the water will separate from the alcohol during freezing and they may not mix evenly when thawing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Well, I never tried such an heresy, but theoretically you will end up with some kind of syrup (or broth, I really don't know the most appropriate word in english for it), thick, and more or less sweet depending on the beer you use. Some beers have more residual sugars than other ones.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Alcohol will be the first to evaporate, then water, which is basically the majority of beers composition, in volume, leaving behind sugars and proteins, basically. Those last compounds can be modified or merged, as well, I can't say. Then, depending on the beer's malt bill (pale, crystal, caramelized, roasted, smoked, etc), you might get different flavors related to it. I don't know what would happen to hop compounds when boiled for a long time, but you'll probably still get some bitterness from them.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You know what, you question got me curious about how it would taste at the end. =P&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer reductions can make very good sauces.  For more flavor you go with &lt;a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/blog/stout-beer-glaze-three-ways" rel="nofollow"&gt;darker beers&lt;/a&gt;, but you apparently want to shy away from using hoppy beers because the bitterness can become rather harsh.  Just punch in something like "beer reduction" into your favorite search engine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer will evaporate down when boiled. During this it will become thicker. The alcohol will evaporate the quickest, then the water. Caramelization (Maillard reaction) will occur. The bitterness will NOT evaporate, making the bitterness more concentrated.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However; boiling wort is "required" to make beer and excessive boiling is used in some styles to give it extra flavours and colours or to make the resulting beer stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Chances are that your cans will also explode. Just leave them in the fridge.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Do a test: take one can and leave it in the fridge. Take another and place it in a plastic container. Close the container and put it in the fridge. The container serves no purpose apart form minimizing the amount of clean-up. After a few days, remove the can from the fridge. If it is still whole, put it in the fridge and mark it with pen so that you know which is which. Leave for two day. Both beers should now be at the same temp. Open them both and compare the beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are many techniques for cooling cans quickly. I would rather do that than leave beers in the freezer.&lt;/p&gt;
