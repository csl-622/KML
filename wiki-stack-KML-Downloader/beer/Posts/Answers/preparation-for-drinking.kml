					&lt;p&gt;Foam comes from over pumping. For most of my keg beers I (with a CO2 tank) use about 11-15psi). For a hand pump this is more difficult. You will have to resist the urge to over pump. If you are a little more engineer-minded you can look at &lt;a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Stop-Guests-from-Overpumping-the-Keg" rel="nofollow"&gt;THIS&lt;/a&gt; article to gauge more consistently your tap pressures. Make sure you let the keg settle after moving as well. Just like shaking a soda can, a lot of jarring will make the CO2 come out of solution. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A trick I use on my homebrew system (I use 5 gallon kegs) is gently placing the keg on its side and slowly rolling it about 3 feet forward and then 3 feet back. Then, I place it back in the fridge and repeat 3 times throughout the day. This helps the CO2 re-dissolve into the beer. However, if you are pulling the keg out of a trunk, throwing it in a trash can and packing it with ice...this solution isn't viable. In which case you want to let it settle and resist the urge to over pump.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almost but not boiling&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've been over a few recipes and "simmering" seems to be the consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Eating will absorb some of the alcohol. Drinking on an empty stomach means the alcohol can go directly to the blood stream and the effects of the alcohol will happen faster. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So if you have food in you, especially breads, it will rather slow the process of getting drunk.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Of course you could eat four loaves of bread a slam a bottle of liquor in less then a minute and it won't help you there. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Collating Darwin and jalynn's answers and some experience running a real ale bar:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the UK, real ales will always be served from a hand pump, as per the &lt;a href="http://www.camra.org.uk/faq" rel="nofollow"&gt;definition from CAMRA:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Real ale is a beer brewed from traditional ingredients (malted barley, hops water and yeast), matured by secondary fermentation in the container from which it is dispensed, and served without the use of extraneous carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But you will always see Carlsberg, Budweiser, Heineken, Guinness, Stella etc pumped using CO2. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you haven't seen them, it must be down to the pubs you frequent :-)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://vinepair.com/buy-this-booze/the-9-best-gins-to-use-in-a-martini/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Vinpair&lt;/a&gt; here are &lt;strong&gt;The 9 Best Gins To Use In A Martini!&lt;/strong&gt;  This list is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; in order of best to worst. However, it does offer gin recommendations for various types of gin. Their number one all around recommendation is in fact &lt;strong&gt;Greylock.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Plymouth&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Plymouth is technically both a style and a brand – how’s that for pizzazz? Plymouth is remarkably gentle. It has a sweet, delicate nose and a woodsy, lemony body. You might even get a bit of cinnamon bark on the palate. The finish is quite smooth, making Plymouth ideal for the bare bones martini. If the idea of drinking a cocktail that’s basically straight liquor freaks you out, Plymouth is a great gin to start with. It’s so welcoming, the first few sips of your martini might evolve into gulps. Drink cautiously.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Bombay Sapphire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;This is about as old timey as it gets. Savory, agreeable, and wonderfully cohesive, Bombay Sapphire is a gin that was born to hang out in a martini. While this low-key gin runs the risk of getting lost in fruitier cocktails, it rests perfectly alongside vermouth to create a balanced martini. Sapphire’s traditional botanicals (like coriander and grains of paradise) latch onto one another to make something great. Think of Sapphire as the perfect chocolate chip cookie: it seems simple, but one taste of a failed contender tells you it ain’t.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Citadelle BEST ON A BUDGET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;If you’re at a great bar and ask for a basic gin cocktail off-menu, there’s a good shot you’ll be tasting Citadelle. This French gin is a great quality purchase. Plenty of orange and overall citrus give Citadelle a nice burst of fruitiness without being fruit forward per se. While there are some floral notes to work with here, Citadelle really straddles the line between unique and eccentric, making it a great choice for a more aromatic, flavor-packed martini. Plus, at around $25, you don’t have a lot to lose. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Euphrosine #9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;All right, so Euphrosine #9 isn’t exactly traditional. In fact, it’s like you took the floral notes in Citadelle and pumped them up a notch (or three). Still, there’s enough palatable sweetness to make Euphrosine #9 a happy martini gin. If you’re looking for a martini that’s on the sweeter side, reach for this NOLA-born pick from producer Atelier Vie. You’ll pick up on hibiscus, berries, and sweet iced tea. Dare we say it, there’s something rather flirtatious about Euphrosine.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. The Botanist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Hey, here’s something from Islay that isn’t Scotch! Bruichladdich crafts this interesting gin, which is made from thirty-one botanicals, twenty-two of which are native to Islay. While that may seem like an overwhelming amount of botanicals when compared to the standard seven or eight, The Botanist holds itself together surprisingly well. This is a complex gin, with a floral nose and an herbal palate. We get chamomile, mint, and citrus zest. Because this gin is so layered, you might want to add even less vermouth than usual. When it comes to your standard martini, The Botanist will really do all the talking, and in this case, that’s okay.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Gin Mare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Do you prefer your martinis dirty? Then use Gin Mare. Seriously, this Spanish gin seems to be genetically engineered for a dirty martini. In a rare instance where branding fits product, Gin Mare is a Mediterranean gin made with olives, thyme, and rosemary amongst other herbs. The viscosity of the gin, combined with its garden-fresh taste, makes it the ideal spirit for a martini with just a hint of olive tartness. With this spicy yet still contained gin, you’ll feel like you’re going beyond a basic martini. Gin Mare is a great example of how a spirit can be both contemporary and classic at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Terroir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Made from the gorgeous distillery at St. George’s Spirits, Terroir gin uses local Douglas fir. Unsurprisingly, Terroir gin was created as an homage to California’s natural resources. While drinking “fir” might put you off at first, it seems that the plant works to intensify the juniper, giving us a gin that has classic pine notes. This gin has a generous layer of crisp juniper bite, yet there’s a certain earthiness to it that prevents it from being too harsh or simplistic. Expect grassy notes, moss, tree sap, and of course, a heavy coat of juniper to round this all up. Like Bombay Sapphire, this gin is as solid as a California redwood.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Greylock BEST OVERALL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;This mighty gin from Berkshire Mountain Distillers has received tons of praise – and rightfully so. Straightforward, London Dry, and clean as a whistle, Greylock is a fantastic martini gin. Spicy licorice combined with lemon peel, black pepper, and a touch of cooking spice make Greylock both approachable and complex. Greylock will add lip-smacking flavor to your martini while still boasting enough unique spiciness to make your cocktail truly special. A hint of sugar-coated juniper berry will give way to just enough sweetness to make your martini quaffable as can be. This is an A+ gin for making martinis – we guarantee your guests will be happy with this crowd-pleaser.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Dorothy Parker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Named after satirical poet and general snark icon Dorothy Parker, this gin from New York Distilling Company would make Ms. Parker proud. Similar to Euphrosine #9, the floral nose is rich with hibiscus, elderflower, pear, and cranberries. The juniper peaks its head around on the blooming palate and the finish, which is zesty. While this is half a world away from Greylock, it’s perfect if you’re looking to whip up a martini that’s a little lighter, bubblier, and of course, a bit more tart – like Ms. Parker herself.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Recommendation are always a hard subject to put across to others because what one person may enjoy, another may find less than favorable!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/drinks/how-to/a1560/martini-gins/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Town and Country Magazine&lt;/a&gt; offers their &lt;strong&gt;5 of the Best Gins for a Classic Martini.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boodles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanqueray&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. George&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aviation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire Mountain Distillers Greylock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally I am a fan of &lt;strong&gt;Beefeater&lt;/strong&gt; as is seen &lt;a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/04/best-gin-for-a-martini-cocktail-taste-test-fords-beefeater-bombay-plymouth.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;The Best Gin for a Martini!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford's Gin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beefeater&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bombay Dry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plymouth Gin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bombay Sapphire&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your liver processes alcohol at a fixed rate (what that rate is depends on your tolerance, current liver function, what medications you are taking, and some genetics). So eating some food, particularly foods that absorb fluids like bread, will slow down the rate of alcohol absorption into your bloodstream, allowing your liver more time to metabolize the alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So for a fixed amount of alcohol, drinking on a full stomach will make you FEEL less drunk because you spread out the alcohol absorption over time so your liver has more time to metabolize it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, you can still saturate your livers ability to metabolize alcohol by ingesting high volumes of alcohol and the absorptive ability of the food in your stomach is limited (unless you vomit it out) so it is FAR from reliable technique to drink but avoid becoming intoxicated or hungover since you are still absorbing all the ingested alcohol, just over a slightly longer period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You seem to be asking two questions, I'll try to answer both although a lot of this is conjecture:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Why are spirits in India poured in multiples of 30ml?&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is likely due to 30ml being easy to both measure out and to drink. 30 ml is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_glass#Sizes" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;pretty standard world-wide&lt;/a&gt; as a small or single measure, and multiplying a small measure (rather than have, say, 30ml followed by 50ml) makes things easy. 20ish g of pure alcohol (large peg) or 10g (small peg) is right in line with many countries' "standard drink"s (e.g. the UK "unit" is 8g, but a typical drink has between &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_alcohol" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;1 and 3 units&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Conceivably, the "peg" might be a semi-standardization of an old northern Indian unit of mass called the &lt;em&gt;chhatank&lt;/em&gt;, which appears to correspond roughly to 60g, but I think that's more likely a coincidence. 4 of them made up a &lt;em&gt;pao&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;pau&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;pav&lt;/em&gt; - but that's almost certainly a red herring and unconnected.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Where and when did this sense of the word &lt;em&gt;peg&lt;/em&gt; come from?&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Likely after and as a consequence of the British Raj. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;OED&lt;/a&gt;'s sense 12 of &lt;em&gt;peg&lt;/em&gt; is&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;colloq. (&lt;em&gt;orig.&lt;/em&gt; Anglo-Indian). &lt;em&gt;Originally: a drink of brandy and soda water. Later more generally: a (usually alcoholic) drink, esp. of spirits; a measure of spirits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The first usage they have is from John Camden Hotten's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dictionary_of_Modern_Slang,_Cant,_and_Vulgar_Words" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Dictionary of Modern Slang, Cant, and Vulgar Words&lt;/a&gt;. All the 19th Century quotations they have seem to refer the mixture of a spirit and something sparkling, mostly soda water. The only clearly Indian quotation they have is from 2003 and refers to the 30ml measure, but they're entirely lacking in quotations between 1939 and 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It seems possible that in turn this usage came from OED's sense 2b, which has quotations going back to 1617:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any of a set of pins fixed at intervals in a drinking vessel to indicate the quantity each drinker is to drink. Now&lt;/em&gt; hist.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But that connection is not made explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;1 ounce equal to 29.57 ml which is close to 30 ml. Ounce being used to measure the liquid in USA. May be this practice has evolved to specify 1 peg for 1 oz.&lt;/p&gt;
