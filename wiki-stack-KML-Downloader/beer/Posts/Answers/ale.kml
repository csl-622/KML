					&lt;p&gt;Ales and lagers are brewed with different types of yeast.  Ale yeast ferments at the top of the brewing vat at a comfortable room temperature while lager yeast ferments at the bottom of the vat at a lower temperature.  The "low and slow" lager fermentation brings out more complex flavors.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ale yeast strains are best used at temperatures ranging from 10 to 25°C, though some strains will not actively ferment below 12°C (33). Ale yeasts are generally regarded as top-fermenting yeasts since they rise to the surface during fermentation, creating a very thick, rich yeast head. That is why the term "top-fermenting" is associated with ale yeasts. Fermentation by ale yeasts at these relatively warmer temperatures produces a beer high in esters, which many regard as a distinctive character of ale beers. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Top-fermenting yeasts are used for brewing ales, porters, stouts, Altbier, Kölsch, and wheat beers. *&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Lager yeast strains are best used at temperatures ranging from 7 to 15°C. At these temperatures, lager yeasts grow less rapidly than ale yeasts, and with less surface foam they tend to settle out to the bottom of the fermenter as fermentation nears completion. This is why they are often referred to as "bottom" yeasts. The final flavour of the beer will depend a great deal on the strain of lager yeast and the temperatures at which it was fermented. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some of the lager styles made from bottom-fermenting yeasts are Pilsners, Dortmunders, Märzen, Bocks, and American malt liquors.* &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The primary difference is the yeast used to ferment the beer -- ales use yeasts strains which work at a warmer temperature (10-25 deg C) than lager yeasts strains (7-15 deg C).  You may hear the terms "top-fermenting" for ale yeasts and "bottom-fermenting" for lagers, but I think that's more-or-less happen-stance -- the yeasts themselves are not inclined toward a particular altitude.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Bitters &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; ales; the English term &lt;em&gt;bitter&lt;/em&gt; is generally equivalent to &lt;em&gt;pale ale&lt;/em&gt;.  Pale ales are made from pale malt and many types are heavily hopped.  The term &lt;em&gt;bitter&lt;/em&gt; refers to the bitterness inherent in their hoppy character when compared to other beers like stouts and porters.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Note that like many beer terms, taxonomy is not hard and fast, e.g. a blonde could be considered a pale ale but few would refer to it as a bitter!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The first part of the picture depicts the description in my answer about where the yeast "works," the temperatures at which they work, and then some common types of ales/lagers. The second picture shows S. cerevisiae (common ale yeast) and a wild yeast S. eubayanus making some new cold tolerant yeast strain babies that are the common lager yeast (S. pastorianus).

					&lt;p&gt;A pale ale is traditionally an ale that is is brewed predominantly with pale malt and is hop forward.  Brewers often add additional malts in order to achieve whatever it is that they're specifically trying to achieve for a given beer, and a pale ale with some caramel or crystal malt will indeed have a darker coloration though on the whole the properties of the beer may still mean that it resides within the definition of the pale ale style.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;It's historical.&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The "Pale" in Pale Ale is mostly historical. In the 18th century, most beers were dark due to being produced with barley malt that was kilned or roasted over wood fires. But from England emerged a new technique using &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mash_ingredients#Pale_malt" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;pale malts&lt;/a&gt;, cured in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coke_(fuel)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;coke-fuelled kilns&lt;/a&gt;. This applied to both ales and lagers, resulting in beers that were bronze, copper or gold—and while you wouldn't look at such colors today and consider them notably "pale," they certainly were pale in contrast to beers back then. In the turn of the 19th century and beyond, the style spread from England to the rest of Europe—&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;When a new brewery was built in Pilsen in Bohemia in 1842, a coke-fired kiln was imported from England. The result was the first golden lager, Pilsner Urquell, which was made possible by British ingenuity and technical advance.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.beer-pages.com/protz/features/ipa.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://www.beer-pages.com/protz/features/ipa.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Note that American Pales are distinct from India Pales as well as from American India Pales. See my answer about &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/28/what-are-the-differences-between-an-ipa-and-its-variants"&gt;the differences between styles of IPAs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The American Pale Ale (also known as APA) is normally a light-colored ale that is traditionally hoppy with light malt flavor. But its formal description is a little bit more flexible. It's defined as a very balanced style. It originates from the English Pale Ales.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The BJCP describes it as the following (short version):&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aroma&lt;/strong&gt;: Moderate to strong hop. Citrusy hop is very common. Also, low to moderate maltiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appearance&lt;/strong&gt;: Pale golden to deep amber. Moderately large white to off-white head with good retention. Generally quite clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taste&lt;/strong&gt;: Pretty much the same as aroma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mouthfeel&lt;/strong&gt;: Medium-light to medium-full body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Like many beer terms, "session beer" is not rigorously defined.  Several groups have tried, though:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.brewersassociation.org/attachments/0000/5183/BA_2011_Beer_Style_Guidlines.pdf"&gt;Brewers Association (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; called it 4.0-5.1% ABV&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://beeradvocate.com/articles/653/"&gt;Beer Advocate&lt;/a&gt; calls it less than 5%&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://sessionbeerproject.blogspot.com/"&gt;The Session Beer Project&lt;/a&gt; calls it 4.5%.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Really, though, if you call something a session beer, most people will understand that to mean something you could easily drink several of in a session (ie, lighter and more mild than a "big" beer).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Technically, yes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The actual answer has more to do with yeast content than carbonation.  Unfiltered beers like real ale have much more yeast in suspension, and yeast has a tendency to make you gassy when digested.  Lager in general has very little yeast due to the long, cold, aging process.  I believe commercial examples are filtered as well.  In general most commercial beers are filtered, or at least have had the yeast killed off somehow, which mitigates the effect.  Real ale's major selling points are that it's unpasteurized and unfiltered, and is refermented in the cask...so it's basically got way more yeast and way more active yeast than other kinds of beer.  And then cask ales are served from a tap at the front near the bottom...near the yeast.  Basically the perfect storm of fart-induction.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The main difference between the two is the different types of yeast that they both use. Lager yeasts are more tolerant to cold temperatures and so are fermented at a lower temperature. This is what gives the lager a crisp flavour. The ale yeasts ferment at higher temperatures and take less time to complete as the yeast is more active the higher the temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Both types also use very different hops and malts...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes, they contain adjuncts which aren't malted barley to make them cheaper to produce. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These adjuncts aren't the same type of sugar so are fermented differently than maltose. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That is possible to a level, but not proven, and probably does not make a huge difference, as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangover#Causes" rel="nofollow"&gt;there are &lt;strong&gt;many factors causing hangover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, some stronger than others. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Moreover, that would be saying that all commercial beers have the same effects and all local brewed ales have the same other (better) effect, which sounds to me very simple and convenient to conclude.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That being said, adjuncts in mass-produced beers may still play a role, but I would tend to seek the explanation for the hangover difference in context first.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But anyway, hangover mechanisms are not well understood, so I could be wrong !&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This does indeed happen to me, too. So I stopped drinking beer where the ingredients aren't listed or if I think the beer is likely to contain GMO. Call me a tree hugger I don't care;-)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I remember reading the head aches may come from fusel oils, which are byproducts of fermentation. Depending on the ingredients there may be more or less of them. I remember reading a while back that mold and spoilage can cause a higher concentration of those fusel oils in the wine; hence, wine made from handpicked grapes is of higher quality. I wouldn't be surprised if it's similar in beer production&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A while back Jim Koch, the owner of Boston Beer Company, said in an interview that his secret to hangover avoidance was straight up eating live brewer's yeast.  This is probably dubious at best, but if you had to stretch to make something sound plausible...yeast has a good amount of Vitamin B and Magnesium, which are essential nutrients.  Anything marketed as Real Ale is likely unfiltered and will therefor have more live yeast in it than filtered ale or lager.  So it could, in theory, maybe, sortof, a bit, if you squint at it, sideways, have something to do with buffering the hangover better vs filtered ale or lager.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It may also be an adjunct fermentation or ABV related thing like others have mentioned.  Or it may not?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, a disclaimer:  I'm American and most of my knowledge of craft beer comes from the American beer scene.  I am somewhat aware of the evolution of the UK brewing industry, but nowhere near as knowledgeable as I am about America's.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Now, definitions.  Craft Beer commonly derives the Brewer's Association definition of a Craft Brewer.  Which is Small, Independent, Traditional.  Sparing the specifics it's a definition meant to exclude the world's largest brewing companies, and their "crafty" portfolios.  "Crafty" is a pejorative used to describe brands or brewers which may or may not produce good tasting beer, but are owned by the larger brands in attempts to diversify their portfolios.  While the BA is primarily focused on the American market, it seems most European writers defer to their terms.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Real Ale, is a distinctly British term.  Coined by CAMRA in the 70's it's more to do with the packaging and serving of the beer in the pub than the business scale of the brewer.  All Real Ale has to do is be cask conditioned and served via a gravity tap or hand-pulled with a beer engine.  This excludes a majority of what we in the US would consider craft beer, because it excludes anything kegged, filtered, force carbonated, or pushed with pressurized gas.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This leads to an interesting overlap where an unfiltered beer, carbonated by natural fermentation, could NOT be a real ale because it was kegged and served on gas.  Also, nothing prevents a large brand like Murphy's or Beamish (both owned by Heineken) from marketing a "Real Ale".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These definitions aside: It sounds like you may just be an IPA fan.  Your craft beer list is entirely IPAs.  It's not really accurate to conflate Craft and IPAs because plenty of craft beers are stouts, rye beers, Scotch ales, English bitters, or totally non-traditional things.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another issue you might have with "Real Ale" is a technical note.  Because it's exposed to oxygen as soon as the cask is tapped real ale tends to spoil if it's not drank quickly.  The characteristic tastes of oxidized beer are cardboard, and the characteristic tastes of beer left on dead yeast for way too long is soapy.  I can easily see that coming off as "waxy", especially if it's warmer than you're used to drinking and you've just downed some IPAs.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer today is probably the best its ever tasted because of refinements in production techniques and farming.  Consumers are becoming interested in what their beer is made of so the quality of ingredients and care on a whole is improving.  But real ale is a niche,  there are going to be great traditional brewers making phenomenal beer, but it's prone to spoilage if not treated well.  There may also be those using it as a marketing gimmick.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And finally a last point about industrialization:  It has vastly improved the quality of ingredient and process that all brewers use.  The huge brands we now have, all started off as craft at one point.  But if they are no longer craft they either couldn't weather the market and faced the choice of no longer being a company or selling to a business and risk becoming more about business than beer.  In the US we have large breweries proving you can still be pretty big and make good beer.  Sam Adams, Stone Brewing, Dogfish Head, Yuengling, are HUGE by craft standards and haven't compromised the quality of their ingredients because brewers are still in charge.  Industrialization will never prevent a brewery lead by a passionate brewer from making interesting beer, but leaving brewing decisions up to a business man will always making boring beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From what I have researched, the term "real ale" derives from the original distinction between beer, which was brewed with hops, and ale, which was not.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The term real ale also relates to whether or not the drink was artificially carbonated or cask conditions. Craft beer is generally brewed with hops, although some craft brewers are trying to use other bittering agents. Likewise, there are craft brewers who use cask conditioning and even more so, bottle conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would say that "craft" beer is a rather vague term. The best way that I could distinguish between "craft" brewers and other brewers is through the use of "craft" or trade. Those who produce beer as a trade would be craft brewers rather as opposed to industrial producers. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My research suggests that Capilano Pale Ale is &lt;strong&gt;no longer brewed&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.vancouverarchives.ca/2012/05/17/beer-in-vancouver/" rel="nofollow"&gt;This Vancouver Archives article&lt;/a&gt; on beer in Vancouver suggests that the Capilano brewery was taken over by Molson in 1958. Searching the address given (&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/#q=1550+burrard+street%2C+vancouver" rel="nofollow"&gt;1550 Burrard Street&lt;/a&gt;), I found that Molson still occupies the space. Very little else comes up when I search for Capilano Brewery or Capilano Pale Ale.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Doing the math out, assuming my liters to US Gallons conversion by Google is accurate, that would come out to around 1.6-1.7 volumes of CO2 in the beer which is on the lower end of carbonation but probably appropriate for many European ale styles.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Think of something like a Bitter or ESB, that's probably where you'll end up.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Caster sugar is just very fine white sugar, so it's probably some form of sucrose...pretty much all of which are interchangeable.  If this is under carbonated for the style you're going for, check out an online carbonation or priming sugar calculator next time and just pitch sugar according to that.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I always liked &lt;a href="http://www.northernbrewer.com/priming-sugar-calculator/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Northern Brewer's&lt;/a&gt;.  It takes beer in gallons since it's a US site but I like that they have a style drop down and list how much of many different types of sugar to use.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That is really too warm as you will get fusel oils as a bi-product.  If you absolutely must do it in that high of a temperature, I would go with an ESB or something.  If you really are going to get into this, you may want to invest in an old refrigerator and maintain around 17 - 20 degrees for an ale.  Well worth the investment if you have the space and money!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not a great answer since I have no specifics for you.  Going out to local bars and stores selling beer and shopping around can find you stuff, but it's expensive.  Though if you're lucky someone might be at one of these places to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another avenue might be to use something like beeradvocate.com, ratebeer.com or untappd.com to get recommendations based on how you rate beers you've had but these are only as good as other user's ratings... They may miss a lot of small or new brands and might not necessarily recommend beers you can actually find near you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're in the South West, then it's definitely worth checking out Otter Brewery (a really good range with a cracking bitter). Also Abbey Ales are the only ales actually brewed in Bath, not to say that Bath Ales aren't great, but this is real Bath ale! Depending how far SW you go, Exeter Brewery's Avocet Ale is a nice drop that you can have a really good session with. 
					Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;São Paulo has seen a big rise in the craft beer scene through the last years (as does the whole country), so you'll probably find what you're looking for. The city doesn't have an actual (physical) brewery of its own (besides brewpubs, which are only a few, the most relevant being Cervejaria Nacional), once most of them are in the countryside of São Paulo state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					Anyway, you won't be disappointed with beers available and bar options - Pinheiros region being the place where you'll find the best ones.
					Keep an eye open for Jupiter, Urbana, STP, which are gypsy breweries born in the city, and have a lot of modern styles (Black IPAs, American Wheat, Brown IPAs, APAs, etc). Urbana has a very good Belgian Strong Golden Ale called Gordelícia, by the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					Bamberg is a brewery dedicated to german styles, with some state-of-art german style reproductions with tons of international awards. Colorado is one of the oldest breweries in the country and, although it doesn't have a wide portfolio, its beers are easy to find at supermarkets, affordable and still very good. They have a very good english-american-hybrid IPA with 'rapadura' (a candy made of molasses). Invicta is one of my favorites from here, having from humble Weizenbiers to Imperial American IPAs, all very good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					Don't miss Empório Alto dos Pinheiros (EAP), the best craft-beer bar in the city, with 30+ taps and excellent food at a fair price. Ah, well, prices overall here aren't very good. Actually, even though the whole craft beer scene is growing faster and faster, taxes and other aspects of the market aren't doing it more affordable to people, but the opposite, unfortunately.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					Besides all that, you are certainly going to find beers from all over the country here, and I guarantee you won't be disappointed with many of them. If you like belgian styles, your best bet is Wals (not from São Paulo, but widely available over here), nowadays probably the best brewery brewing belgian traditional styles in the country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					PS: Off course we are not USA. You won't find six-packs here, nor even a 12oz Imperial IPA bottle for 3 bucks. But, willing to spend some money and knowing what to go for and what not, it's possible to drink good beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're really willing to push your own limits, try &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wild&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;'s sour/wild beers. I became aware of them last year completely by accident, in a trip to UK, and loved their &lt;em&gt;Modus Operandi&lt;/em&gt; beer. I also had another very light pale sour wich wasn't remarkable compared to the first one, but fairly ok. (I guess it probably should have had more time in the bottle to develop and reach its full potential).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sours beers are not for everyone, and the common first reaction to them is negative. But, if one get over that first shocking experience, go on and try it again, people usually fall in love with it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;They are called &lt;em&gt;Wild&lt;/em&gt; because they use in their fermentation process, in addition to possible other yeasts, &lt;em&gt;brettanomyces&lt;/em&gt; yeast, also known as wild yeast, a different species, found in some kinds of wine and belgians beers (lambics, flanders red), which gives very rustic but complex and delightful aromas to the beer. It doesn't actually makes a beer sour (it actually produces a very small amount of acid only), but "wild" beers usually have other types of what is called bugs (bacteria and other fungi) in it, which does leave a lot of acid to the final beer, making it sour.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;They also have regular beers (IPA, Saison, Pale Ale), and they're almost always creative and daring on their recipes. I guess, whether you like it or not, all their beers are worth a try, because those guys seem to take brewing very seriously and you can expect nothing less than quality stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I wish I was still there to taste all their beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And a bonus: they're from Evercreech, soutwest. ;) Look it up at &lt;a href="http://www.wildbeerco.com/beers/" rel="nofollow"&gt;their site&lt;/a&gt; and see what they've got.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I brew in South Florida with similar ambient temps during the spring-summer-autumn.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For beer styles, check out the saison, which enjoys a higher fermentation temperature.

I've had great success with this strain, even at the higher ends of the range.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://beerandwinejournal.com/high-temp-yeast/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Beer and Wine Journal&lt;/a&gt; has a nice list of yeasts that do well in higher temps.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;White Labs WLP550 (Belgian Ale) — 68–78°F (20–26 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;White Labs WLP566 (Belgian Saison II yeast) — 68–78°F (20–26 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;White Labs WLP568 (Belgian Style Saison Ale Yeast Blend) — 70–80 °F
					  (21–27 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;White Labs WLP065 (American Whiskey Yeast) — 75-82 °F (24–28 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;White Labs WLP655 (Belgian Sour Mix 1) — 80-85+ °F (27–29 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;White Labs WLP665 (Flemish Ale Blend) — 68-80°F (20 –27 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Wyeast 1214 (Belgian Abbey) — 68-78° F (20-24° C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Wyeast 1388 (Belgian Strong Ale) — 64-80° F (18-27° C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Wyeast 3724 (Belgian Saison) — 70-95 °F (21-35 ° C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Wyast 3725 (PC Biere de Garde) — 70-84 °F (21-29 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Wyeast 3763 (Roeselare Ale Blend) — 65-85 °F (18-30 °C)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Wyeast 3787 (Trappist High Gravity) — 64-78 °F (18-25 °C)&lt;/p&gt;

					  &lt;p&gt;Fermentis Safbrew WB-06 — 12-25°C (54-77 °F)&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're looking to bring the beer to a little bit below ambient (as fermentation is a bit of an exothermic process) try a small plastic tub full of cool water with the carboy in it wrapped in a towel. The towel will wick up cool water and evaporate, basically acting like a giant sweat gland!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I don't think anyone would deliberately or professionally serve &lt;em&gt;warm&lt;/em&gt; beer, if by warm you mean something close to body temperature. Generally speaking, cask ale (as opposed to pressurised keg beer) is served, in the UK at least, and according to CAMRA's website, at cellar temperature: 12-14 C (54-57 F), whereas lager and keg beer is usually served much colder.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So much for the purist. My preference is always for cask ale to be served cool, but not cold, so that the flavours can be properly appreciated. Good quality lager should be served colder, and I prefer Czech pilsners at around 6-8 C - about the same temperature as you'd want white wine to be. But on a burning hot day in the African sunshine (where I'm from), there is nothing as refreshing as an ice-cold (and I mean &lt;strong&gt;ice&lt;/strong&gt;-cold) ordinary mass-market lager, straight out of the bottle. You can't distinguish tastes as readily at those temperatures. Refreshment is the key there: you don't really care about taste in those circumstances (if you did you'd be drinking something else).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it that some beers are served Cold and why are some served Warm?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;At what temperature should a beer be served can be answered by the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Most beers have an ideal serving temperature. There’s a chart below outlining which styles are served at what temperature, but as a general rule the temperature at which to serve a beer is correlated to the strength of the beer. &lt;strong&gt;As beers go up in alcohol, they are generally drunk at a warmer temperature.&lt;/strong&gt; This is because stronger beers often are sipped slowly, and enjoyed for their complexity of flavor and aroma while weaker beers are often consumed for refreshment. For no style is this more apparent than American macro lagers, which are generally drunk so cold that you can’t taste them. There’s a reason those big brewers want people to drink their beers at tongue-numbing temperatures. As they warm up, they don’t taste very good. - &lt;a href="http://craftbeertemple.com/videoblog/serving-beer/" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Craft Beer Temple.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Following up on my own question. I was in Vancouver a few months ago, went to the same exact place where I had had the Capilano pale ale years ago (the restaurant on the top of the mountain where the tram goes), and can definitely say they don't carry it, had never even heard of it (younger wait staff). So, it would seem it doesn't exist anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beers (ales and lagers) are broken down into many, many different styles based on how they are brewed. Most beers have only 3 or 4 different types of ingredients. Malt, water, yeast, hops and sometimes fruit or herbs. While there doesn't seem like there can be a lot of variation, there are almost an infinite amount of ways to combine these ingredients. For the specific beers you mention, Brown Ale and Mild Ale are very similar styles. I'm not sure what you mean by "The Ale". &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.craftbeer.com/beer/beer-styles-guide#english-style-dark-mild" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Mild Ale&lt;/a&gt; vs. &lt;a href="https://www.craftbeer.com/beer/beer-styles-guide#english-style-brown-ale" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Brown Ale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;English-Style Brown Ale
					Style Family: Brown Ales&lt;/strong&gt;
					The English-style brown ale ranges from dryer (Northern English) to sweeter (Southern English) maltiness. Roast malt tones (chocolate, nutty) may sometimes contribute to the flavor and aroma profile. Hop bitterness is very low to low, with very little hop flavor and aroma. Known for rich and advanced malt aroma and flavor without centering too much on hops, the English-style mild is extremely sessionable and food-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;English-Style Mild Style Family: Brown Ales&lt;/strong&gt;
					Malt and caramel are part of the flavor and aroma profile of the English-style mild while licorice and roast malt tones may sometimes contribute as well. Hop bitterness is very low to low. U.S. brewers are known to make lighter-colored versions as well as the more common “dark mild.” These beers are very low in alcohol, yet often are still medium-bodied due to increased dextrin malts.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you want to dig deeper into this read the &lt;a href="https://www.craftbeer.com/beer/beer-styles-guide" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Beer Style Study Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hangovers are worse depending on sugar content regardless of type of alcoholic beverage. Mixed drinks that use sugar free mixes don’t hurt as much the next day so figure out the sugar content.&lt;/p&gt;
