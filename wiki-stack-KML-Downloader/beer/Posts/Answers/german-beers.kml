					&lt;p&gt;The German Beer Purity Law, also know as the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinheitsgebot"&gt;Reinheitsgebot&lt;/a&gt;, dictates what ingredients may be used to create beer in Germany: barley, hops, and water.  It dates back to 1487, which is why you may notice the omission of &lt;em&gt;yeast&lt;/em&gt;: it hadn't been recognized as an ingredient yet.  The law was removed from the books in 1993, and replaced by another similar law which allowed yeast, sugar, and some of the more common brewing ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the case of a US brewery making such a claim, it's a sort of advertisement toward the "purity" of their product, i.e., they don't use adjuncts (rice, etc) or other flavorings (fruit, spices) in their beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The purity law has been introduced to regulate the production of beer in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire" rel="nofollow"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The original text stipulated that the only ingredients that could be used in the production of beer were water, barley and hops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The "Reinheitsgebot" has actually survived the Holy Roman Empire. Many German brewers are proud of this heritage and claim to stick to it. It's relevance today is commercial. It's used as a label for marketing reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In addition to what's been said, the original purpose of the order was to protect consumers from brewers who used problematic (toxic/psychoactive) herbs to preserve their beer, instead forcing them to use hops.  Also only using barley allowed wheat and rye to be used exclusively by bakers to keep the cost of bread down.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One could argue the tradition has kept German brewers from innovating, and also keeps a lot of interesting styles out of reach.  Most Belgian-style beers, despite having a similar heritage to German styles, will include candi sugar and spices like anise and coriander.  Technically, sour beers are also out.  Also, a lot of the Trappist ales will use sugar adjuncts.  Today, it's mostly a statement of adherence to tradition, which can carry good marketing weight.  But this is beer, not marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I can't speak to the fame of Frankfurt, but Apple Cider is not a beer by most or all common definitions.  It's probably closer to a fruit wine.  The major characteristic that defines beer is that some conversion has taken place which converts starches from a grain of some sort into sugars, while wines are simply fermenting simple sugars already present in a fruit's juice.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ironically this makes Ginger Beer more like a wine and Sake, though commonly called Rice Wine, more like a beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Due to differing geographic and climatic conditions, different areas of Germany specialize on different kinds of agriculture. The area to the south and west of Frankfurt is one of the major fruit producing regions in Germany (red in the map below, &lt;a href="http://www.deutsches-obst-und-gemuese.de/immer-frisch/anbaugebiete/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zeI0C.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In this area apple trees start to bloom much earlier in the year than elsewhere (&lt;a href="http://www.fachdokumente.lubw.baden-wuerttemberg.de/servlet/is/50118/inf07_20008.html?COMMAND=DisplayBericht&amp;amp;FIS=200&amp;amp;OBJECT=50118&amp;amp;MODE=BER&amp;amp;RIGHTMENU=null" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;, visit link to see the progression of apple blooming over Germany):&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6i6Gx.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Since people like to turn everything they produce into alcoholic beverages, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_wine" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;fruit wines&lt;/a&gt; – of which (grape) &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;wine&lt;/a&gt; is a just a variety – are common and popular in fruit growing regions. Most popular with everyone I know is home-made strawberry wine, but plum wine is a favourite, too, and any berry or fruit is used, with every family that owns a garden making one or two bottles of these fruit wines each autumn.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Apples are different because we grow so much more of them than strawberries or plums, and they are regularly pressed into apple juice in large quantities by the fruit grower cooperatives that sell it to the beverage industry. If you don't pasteurize the juice (for long term stability), it turns alcoholic after a couple of days, and after the apple harvest everyone gets large cannisters of freshly pressed juice from the cooperative presses, bakes onion tarts ("Dinnele"), and eats and drinks this seasonal speciality, with more or less alcohol, depending on taste.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"Most" (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Must" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;must&lt;/a&gt;) or "Süßmost" (sweet must) is freshly pressed juice; once it has turned alcoholic (and sour) it has different names in different areas, such as "Sauermost" (sour must) and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apfelwein" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Apfelwein&lt;/a&gt; (apple wine).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Within southern Germany and Austria, Frankfurt is not specifically famous for apple wine, the drink, because it is drunk elsewhere, too. What the region around Frankfurt is somewhat well-known for are the festivities surrounding the end of the apple harvest and the pressing of apple juice, which have been the background theme for a musical tv show, &lt;a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zum_Blauen_Bock" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Zum Blauen Bock&lt;/a&gt; (The Blue Goat Buck), that ran from 1957 to 1987. The tv studio for that show was styled like a Hessian apple wine folk fair, and the moderator gave each of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkst%C3%BCmliche_Musik" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;folksy&lt;/a&gt; musicians and other guests one "&lt;a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bembel" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Bembel&lt;/a&gt;", the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoneware" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;stoneware&lt;/a&gt; jug traditionally used to serve the apple wine in that region, for them to take home.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;At that time there were only two national tv channels in Germany, and many kids grew up spending cosy weekend family tv evenings watching that show. I would guess that this is what makes Apple Wine "famous" (for us), but only in the special Hessian pronunciation "Ebbelwoi".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/86/]/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Beer Advocate&lt;/a&gt;, a longer than normal conditioning period is one possible reason for it being an "altbier". A second explanation is that it's tied to Latin and refers to the rising yeast.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Quite a few breweries outside Dusseldorf make altbiers (or have made, at least). That BeerAdvocate page lists &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Was the beer that you tried pale yellow, slightly sour in flavour and cloudy? If so it was probably Weissbier which is Bavarian wheat based beer. Any Weissbier or wheat beer should be similar to it and these are widely available (some British and American breweries have started to make wheat beers recently). If you like Weissbier you will probably like the Saison (style) beers from France and Belguim.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It the beer was dark coloured it was probably the &lt;strong&gt;highly seasonal&lt;/strong&gt; and delicious Bockbier which is extremely difficult to get outside Bavaria and out of season.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Essentially it is an ale that ends up being lagered after the primary fermentation is completed. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The malts used are primarily pilsen, which is normally used in lagers.
					Not a lot of hop flavor and aroma, some bitterness but a closer malt/hop balance.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Altbiers are light copper to light brown ales with white heads. The beer is very clear due to the lagering. The aroma is slightly malty, with almost no hop aroma. The flavor is bitter. Not an IPA bitter, but still a firm bitter flavor. Some of the altbiers have a light caramel flavor, which I like, and is followed by a dry finish. The beer could be compared to a hoppy Vienna style lager. The alcohol content of the beer is lower than average, usually between 4.5% to 5.2%. This makes altbiers a great session beer.

					&lt;p&gt;As was said before, a Weissbier is also called a Hefeweizen and is very common in Bavaria and the rest of Germany.  If you want something similiar look for a Paulaner Hefeweizen which is sold in America.  The yeast that is added gives it a strong Banana like flavor.  It is typically served in a tall narrow glass. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Other common beers in Bavaria are Oktoberfest, Pilsner, Doppelbock, and Dunkel. Out of those the Pilsner and Oktoberfest don't have a ton a flavor.  The other two have sweeter flavors and are darker with the Doppelbock being available in the winter as a high alcohol beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Very few labels will specify Bavaria, but all imported beers are required by law to specify their country of origin. Bavarian Beers(or Biers if you will) are the same as other German beers, so simply look for a German beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beck's is a pale German pilsner brewed by Beck's Brewery headquartered in Bremen.  The actual beer you drank was likely brewed in St. Louis, however, as Beck's is wholly owned by AB InBev.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Pale Lagers as a style are usually straw colored, up to a light gold with a white head.  The flavor is very light and dry with only slight malty sweetness.  A little crisp hop bitterness without too much hop aroma.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most "macrobrews" will be somewhat similar, though the stock "American" variant of Pale Lager like Budweiser or Miller will have a corn sugar flavor to them and likely be a bit lighter in body.  Beck's claimed to adhere to the German Beer Purity Law which would prohibit the use of an adjunct like corn.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;St. Pauli Girl is a very similar beer, and I think is even brewed in the same town as the original Beck's.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you want to stick with imports just about any pale German lager is going to do it for you since it's a very traditional style.  Anything by Spaten, Hacker-Pschorr, or Weihenstephan is solid and usually pretty easy to get ahold of.  Pilsner-Urquell is also a great beer, but it's in the Pilsner style so while it's still a pale lager Pilsners can have a sulfur-y or buttery tinge due to the green bottles and slight diacetyl.  Pilsners also have a strong hop character and bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to try local or American brewed versions just about anyone's Session Lager (Full Sail comes to mind, as does Notch if you're near MA at all) should be similar.  According to &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/place/city/6/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this list&lt;/a&gt; on BeerAdvocate you should be near Berghoff and Baderbrau which will both make traditional German styles.  Some breweries, Baderbrau included, will call their pale lager a "Lawnmower beer".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Branching out, Sam Adams Boston Lager is a style called Vienna Lager which may also appeal you.  Though it will be significantly maltier than Beck's.  Anything with Dortmunder in the name will also be similar, though hoppier but not like an American Pale Ale or IPA or anything.  You might also be interested in any brewery's Cream Ale, which is an Ale version of the Pale Lager style.  Kolsch style beers may also appeal to you since they share the same light body and slight maltiness.  Kolsch's are hybrid beers which are fermented warm like an Ale would be, but then cold conditioned like a Lager.  Officially Kolsch can only be brewed in Cologne, Germany, but many American breweries will make a Kolsch style since it drinks really well in the summer and provides more flavor variety than pale lager or Cream Ale.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Does that help?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Is "because local people want to buy it" too glib? Where there's demand there is (or should be) supply. If the Italian versions of German style beers are anything like their British counterparts there will be a flavour difference (just as there is between the different beers that are produced within Germany) but the brewers will tend to (in their own unique fashion) try to be as true to the original style as possible. As this depends on the availability and quality of raw materials there will always be a difference, but that is true even within Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In total:
					1) because people like it.
					2) not consistently but probably slightly more variation than in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Where did you read this? I am unfamiliar with Dunkle Hefe exactly, but this is true for wooden casks. 
					Typically a wooden cask is served with gravity or with a hand pump to lift from a cellar. There is an opening in the top that draws air in to equalise the pressure. This air will reduce the shelf life to 3 days.
					A "Donkey Pump" on the common sankey keg is similar. The beer will spoil quite fast.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To add to Leo's answer... Northern Italy is very much associated with Austro-Bavarian heritage. The province of South Tyrol is predominantly German speaking, and Trento is just south of that province. In addition, Weissbier is to Bavaria/Munich as Pretzels are to Philadelphia or Pizza is to New York.... Hmmm maybe that pretzels analogy was a bad idea  since they are a German thing. Oh well, I think you get the point. You've got German people in Northern Italy making German beer. I would trust any Hefeweizen from Trentino over Blue Moon, that's for sure. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This gels with what I've heard of Hefe's in general.  The recommendation to store the keg upside down is definitely yeast-centric, when you flip the keg to tap it it'll stir the yeast up again... which you want.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The 3 day thing is a little more puzzling.  Wheat beers in general are a style that should be had as fresh as possible, but 3 days is definitely pushing it.  Most bars will try to finish a keg of a fresh wheat beer in 2 weeks or less, if memory serves.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From reading the Google automated translation of that PDF you're referencing, that sounds like a sales/marketing document.  The way I'm taking the information is that the document is selection criteria for starting accounts with Erdinger to sell the beer at your bar.  A lot of the document seems like quality control steps like making sure the draft system is setup correctly and properly balanced, making sure the lines get cleaned at appropriate intervals, and the 3 day thing for assuring max freshness.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From a consumer standpoint:&lt;/strong&gt;  It'll last more than 3 days, you can take however long you want if it's on CO2, but for best flavor for a wheat beer you probably want to drink it within a month or 2...probably a bit longer if it's been refrigerated.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Heineken is the closest. I only actually enjoy two brands of beer: Heineken used to be my favorite until I got bored with it and the store clerk recommended Beck's. They go hand in hand! Like peas in a pod!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beck's is a German pilsner (a type of lager), sharp, crisp, flavorfull, and is not filling. Beck's uses roasted hops and has a more bitter earthy flavor with much less foam.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The flavor of other "light lagers" (european pilsners) may be similar, however, a German pilsner is much easier to drink because, unlike most other light lager beers, a true pilsner is much less filling and has much less foam. German pilsners are noted for "drinkability". Beck's can be consumed with a large meal and then consumed afterwards as well. I believe this is why many non beer drinkers prefer and enjoy Beck's and almost no other beer. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilsner#Pilsner_beer_styles" rel="nofollow"&gt;Click here for a list of "German style pilsners" as well as a list of the other types of similar beers and what makes them different&lt;/a&gt; Light lagers such as Heinekin, Stella, Amstel, etc ... are "European pilsner" beers typically labeled as lager whereas a German pilsner beer is typically labeled "pilsner" or "pils".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/81/37570/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Heineken does produce a true pilsner variety&lt;/a&gt; but it is not officially distributed or available within the United States. &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/81/246/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Heineken lager&lt;/a&gt; is distributed and sold throughout North America and has much more body and is more filling as one would expect from a light lager or "european pilsner".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sam Adams Gold pilsner is described as having "great body". This is not a characteristic of most German pilsners that are sharp and light bodied. This beeradvocate post goes on to say that &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/articles/216/" rel="nofollow"&gt;"This is one of those beers to give to a Bud drinker"&lt;/a&gt; . . . definitely not something most people would say of Beck's. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Similar beers include: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Pauli_Girl" rel="nofollow"&gt;St Pauli Girl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;pilsner&lt;/strong&gt; (not to be confused with St Pauli Girl lager) is brewed for export only at the Beck's brewery in Bremen Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsingtao_Brewery" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tsingtao&lt;/a&gt;, a Chinese brewed German pilsner. Tsingtao is a product of the German occupation of Qingdao from the late 1800s until 1914. Not quite a flavorful as Beck's because the original recipe has changed but still a German pilsner in many aspects. Tsingtao is widely available at many Asian restaurants throughout North America and is a much better alternative or substitute for Beck's than Heinekin or Stella.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Löwenbräu produces Beck's under licence for southern Germany and other parts of europe and is known for similar flavor (but then again, so is Heineken).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/articles/216/" rel="nofollow"&gt;here is another list of German Pilsners.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Update:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're going to go the way of sam adams, at least get the right kind of beer and not some awful american lager. &lt;a href="https://www.samueladams.com/craft-beers/noble-pils" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sam Adams makes a Noble Pils.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Noble hops are the type of hops German pilsners are distinct for, strong hops flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Even better is &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/10607/62989/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sixpoint crisp&lt;/a&gt;. Strong hops flavor, easy to drink, and almost no hint of barley. More fruty than Beck's. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=2&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0CCsQFjAB&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPilsner_Urquell&amp;amp;ei=5P7GVIW-GMmyggS8s4GIAw&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNG2zAjSX00VamqUUpxEorf_KRbDiw&amp;amp;bvm=bv.84349003,d.eXY" rel="nofollow"&gt;Pilsner Urquell&lt;/a&gt; has a bit more foam than I would like from a German beer (probably because it's not German) but still did not weigh heavy on my stomach and easy to drink as well. Not quite as much flavor but I did not try the bottle. This one is a traditional pils.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I tried another German beer at the bar recently "&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://us.weihenstephaner.com/en/our-beers/?slide=Original%20Premium#slider-beer-main" rel="nofollow"&gt;Weihenstephaner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; original", brewed at the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weihenstephan_Abbey" rel="nofollow"&gt;world's oldest brewery&lt;/a&gt; in Germany and brewed according to the German purity law of 1516. Sure enough, I didn't have to burp once. Drank a full pint glass and wasn't bloated one bit. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finally, the taste was the same familiar strong, pungent, and bitter hoppy taste I've grown so fond of from drinking German Beck's over the years and yes it comes in a very dark brown bottle. The bitterness is ranked at 21. They also make a pils with a bitterness of 32.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I feel it should be added that beer brewed in Germany often conforms to the Reinheitsgebot or the German purity law of 1516. This gives German beer the crisp fresh taste and this is also why the foam doesn't linger and make you feel bloated. In all other countries, including the united states, beer manufacturers are known to &lt;a href="http://foodbabe.com/2013/07/17/the-shocking-ingredients-in-beer/" rel="nofollow"&gt;include many other ingredients&lt;/a&gt;. Notably, chemicals are added for "head retention" that are not included in German beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;AB claims it is. In reference to it being brewed in the US,&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Chris Cools, the head of the German branch of the company, says he's confident that Becks will lose none of its German character. He believes the beer's taste will be enough to ensure success. Becks is brewed according to Germany's Beer Purity Law, the Reinheitsgebot, that dates back hundreds of years and is made in exactly the same way in 15 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The classic, strict interpretation of the law would require only barley to be used as a grain. There are more lax standards currently, revised as the &lt;a href="http://archiv.jura.uni-saarland.de/BGBl/TEIL1/1993/19931400.1.HTML" rel="nofollow"&gt;Provisional German Beer Law&lt;/a&gt; (in German), but by using the name of Reinheitsgebot, it's safe to assume they are intending to convey the original restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, Indian Pale Ale is not a type of beer you would typically find in Germany, and, as you hinted at, many Germans do not even know IPA. Furthermore, at least to my knowledge, none of the different styles prevalent in Germany (basically, bock and doppelbock are just beers with higher alcohol content and gravity) is a real alternative to IPA.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;BUT! over the last few years, there definitely was progress, and some small breweries startet producing IPA (see, for example, &lt;a href="http://www.schoppebraeu.de/unsere-biere.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Schoppebraeu&lt;/a&gt; (Berlin)). In addition, there are some small marketers that have IPA's in their range of products (see, for example, &lt;a href="http://www.braufactum.de/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Braufaktum&lt;/a&gt; with many points of sale in Germany and, especially, in Berlin).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It doesn't help you today, but Stone Brewing Company is opening a brewery in Berlin later this year or early next year.  They make plenty of IPAs.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I had the same impression in my first time in Germany, its a nation of good beers, but (maybe thanks to their old purity law), they are very closed on their own styles. I could say the same from Czech Republic.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Both nations make the best beers in the world in their main schools, but limited on other genres. And both mostly produce lagers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I never tasted a German beer simmilar to an IPA, but at least thanks to EU you can always buy something from England or Belgium&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You may find a few microbreweries making IPAs there, but I have no idea how restrict are their distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sommelierbier.de/backbonesplitter.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Hans Müller Sommelierbier's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ale-mania.de/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ale-Mania's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.crewrepublic.de/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Crew Republic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Off course, if you're a hophead, your best bet is to wait for Stone to kick-off their production and distribution there.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As an advice: give german styles a chance too. In general, they're much less extreme than american ones, and definitely not hop-forward, but they have their own beauty. They're delicate, balanced and diverse. If you really like beer, explore as much as you can. You're probably going to find something that pleases you. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First of all... you must know in this regions there is a laarge tradition with beer, so microbreweries are not as usual as in other regions, because there is a lot of abbeys and old factories that made beer in a traditional way. That tradition gives us really good beers, what makes microbreweries less usual than in other regions like Spain or Italy or center-south part of France where &lt;em&gt;comercial&lt;/em&gt; beers are a real shit ;).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That's why I will make not only a microbreweries list, but also places where you can find craft and traditional beers of each region. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as I read, Warsteiner is not a Pilsener because they don't use enough hops. It's like a Pilsener but less bitter.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"premium verum" is just a marketing-joke. Warsteiner is a real "Pilsener".
					And they brew according to the german purity law.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your body takes a while to break down alcohol that is in your bloodstream. I believe it is 1 hour per 3%. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;During this period you will not rest, as your body is still hard at work.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hangovers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Primary causes are dehydration and toxins built up in your system from the impurities in the alcohol you've been drinking, but in my personal experience and research sugar content can also contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Dehydration&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Alcohol makes people urinate more, which raises the chances of dehydration occurring. Dehydration can give the individual that sensation of thirst and lightheadedness.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Impurites&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most alcoholic beverages contain small amounts of chemicals
					other than ethanol as a by-product of the materials used
					in the fermenting process (e.g., grains and wood casks). Congeners
					are complex organic molecules with toxic effects including
					acetone, acetaldehyde, fusel oil, tannins, and furfural. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Spirits have these in higher quantities than beer or wine due to the distillation process. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Sugar content&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Depending on what specific brands you are drinking and/or what you are mixing with high sugar content can cause you to have a sugar crash contributing to the hangover feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Quality&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In my personal experience the mornings after indulging with top shelf spirits are notably better than those done on a budget. Bargain spirits tend to be cut with grain alcohol and balanced with corn syrup contributing to the issue, but in general higher priced spirits tend to be more highly refined (Vodka for example tends to have more filtration the more expensive it is).  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;References&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A couple of US brewed beers that arise from it are Sierra Nevada Kellerweis and Sly Fox Royal Weiss; but if you'd prefer a more easy-going (and usually cheaper solution), I'd go with &lt;a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/4477/13892/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Gösser Dark&lt;/a&gt; - although it's not make in the US (but in Austria) it's widespread across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Erdinger Urweisse and Erdinger Hefeweissbier should also be close. Both are brewed in Erding (roughly 15 miles from Weihenstephan), but reportedly available throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if you will find any Oktoberfest beer at the airport but they are available several weeks before "official" start in big groceries or beer shops.  Hacker-Pschorr Oktoberfest Märzen, Paulaner Oktoberfest and Löwenbräu Oktoberfestbier were already available three weeks  ago even in nothern Germany. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It suggests that the filtering is somehow better.  But really it's Marketing - conjuring the mental image of a delicious cold frosty beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The base idea is that proteins &amp;amp; yeasts in the beer (which cause haze) will clump together because of the cold - with the implication that somehow this provides better filtering.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The truth of it is that no beer is filtered at non-cold temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Filtering can make a very "bright" beer - that is, it is clear.  Filtering is done with different technologies, and down to different levels.  Some beer styles are not filtered at all (e.g. German Hefeweizens - cloudy wheat beers) as are many craft beers, whereas others are filtered to the point where just about all particulates - including yeasts and suspended proteins are removed.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, lagered beers had a long time for the yeast etc. to settle out, thus producing an quite bright beer without filtering.  Many home brewers use this technique too.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Filtering can remove a lot of flavour from the beverage, but it does increase shelf-stability and product longevity. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From a home-brewing point of view: cold-crashing is when you take your fermenting/ed wort and stick it in the refrigerator causing the yeast to become inactive and/or fall out of solution. It can be used as a way to quickly stop fermentation if a desired ABV (% alcohol) has been reached. However, the more common reason this is done is to bring clarity to the beer more quickly. The even less common answer is fractional freezing to increase the ABV.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;99/100 times the answer is cold-crashing/chill-filtering is a way to bring clarity to the beer. As the beer brews and yeast becomes inactive, it falls out of solution to the bottom (&lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/8/what-is-the-difference-between-an-ale-and-a-lager/18#18"&gt;there is a difference on where fermentation occurs in ales v lagers&lt;/a&gt;) forming a "trub." Even if you let the beer set in a still, sterile environment for months... you can still get more yeast to fall out of solution by bringing the temperature down a considerable amount. There are definitely times that you don't want this to happen as the yeast strains also impart flavors to beers. The "banana esters" you get (or that some perceive) from Belgian beers actually comes from the yeast that remain in the beer. &lt;a href="https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/01/how-to-indentify-yeast-character-in-beer-what-are-esters-phenols-alcohol.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Here is a quick run down&lt;/a&gt; of identifying yeast flavors and what you should anticipate tasting in some styles. &lt;a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/a6/02/9a/a6029a0d992e641edd4c3ff56921132c.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Here is a neat info-graphic&lt;/a&gt; from brew-dog that talks about yeast in the brewing process, how some strains impart flavors, and what the options are for "finishing" your beer.     &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Stopping the fermentation too soon can leave unwanted flavors in your beer. The one that immediately comes to mind is Diacetyl. &lt;a href="https://www.whitelabs.com/sites/default/files/Diacetyl_Time_Line.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;This PDF&lt;/a&gt; is an explanation of the timeline for the creation of Diacetyl in the fermenting process. They tend to produce butter flavors but are considered undesirable in higher concentration by BJCP (beer judge certification program). &lt;a href="http://www.belgiansmaak.com/off-flavours-in-beer-off-flavours/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Here is a list of 15 common off-flavors&lt;/a&gt;, their sources, and how they affect beers. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Fractional freezing is not a filtration method. It is being included because we're talking about making beer cold before we're packaging it. Because beer yeast can't survive in concentrations &gt;14% ABV... Making it so cold the water freezes and can be removed before the alcohol portion freezes is a way to concentrate and jack-up the %ABV. &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-01/beersci-how-make-strong-beer-stronger#page-2" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Here is a link from PopSci&lt;/a&gt; talking about fractional freezing more in depth.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;All of this just to say - Chill filtering has a time and a place in beers depending on what you want the end result of your brew to be. The real reason anyone touts a process in advertising is just to help differentiate themselves from the competition. Miller Lite always advertises "Triple Hops Brewed" like it is innovative. Really, adding hops at the beginning of the brew impart bitterness, middle of the brew is some bitter more flavor, end is almost purely for aromatic purposes. A lot of beers you have will have been brewed with hops placed into the the process at three different times. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Fun link for &lt;a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/101/hops/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;hop-type-flavor-characteristics&lt;/a&gt; in beers.&lt;/p&gt;
