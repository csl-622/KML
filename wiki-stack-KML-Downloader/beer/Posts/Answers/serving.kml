					&lt;p&gt;It depends on the beer really.  A good rule of thumb is darker beer should be served at a warmer temperature than lighter beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For instance if you refrigerate all of your beers and then pull them out of the fridge and drink them instantly you will miss A LOT of the flavor complexity of pretty much every stout and porter you put to your lips.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But, if you let the dark stuff warm up for just 15 minutes before you drink it (let it sit at room temp) a bunch of new flavors will appear that you never would have noticed otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This doesn't work so well, in my experience, for lighter beers like pilsner, lager, or hefe-weisen.  They really are meant to be drank cold and letting them get warm changes their flavor profile for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Obviously there will always be personal preferences but, at a minimum I encourage you to try letting your darker beers warm up just a bit and see what a positive difference it makes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is a temperature guide from this article: &lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/Story.asp?StoryID=479" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Serving Temperature Guide&lt;/a&gt;. It categorizes different beers based on temps to serve at.  These are basic rules of thumb and again you'll want to experiment and discover what temps you like your beers at the best.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Like most beers, the main thing is the height of the foam on top of the beer.  It's largely a matter of personal preference; the only considerations I'm aware of are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Bottle-fermented beers should be poured slowly and all in one go to prevent yeast from going into the glass (and, to that end, leave half a finger of beer in the bottle).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Unless it's an unfiltered wheat beer, in which case the yeast is meant to go in the glass.  Also, hefeweizens like this should go for a little larger head than normal (2-2.5 fingers).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Or if it's a nitrogenated beer (Eg, Guinness with a widget), you should simply &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNCaV3e9BEg&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;upend the can or bottle into the glass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Otherwise, most people aim for about 1 finger-width of foam.  As long as you have at least some head and it doesn't overflow the glass, you're pouring fine.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In general, nitrogenation imparts a creamier, smoother texture to a beer. The bubbles are smaller in size than CO2 bubbles, and the reduced solubility results in a thicker beverage, which is both delicious, and results in that visually appealing 'cascade' effect. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, you can do &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/yNCaV3e9BEg"&gt;this with a Nitro beer. And that's awesome.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the traditional way of serving beer. The keg is filled with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in order to push the beer into the tap. Since all beer contains CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, pressurizing the keg will maintain the natural carbonization of the beer as it is being served. The amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that the beer already has needs to be taken into account because nobody likes their beer too foamy or too flat.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Nitro dispensing is a newer method. In this case, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is used under high pressure either instead of or with the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It replaces some of the natural CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the beer, which results in a creamy flavor as well as a thick, tight foam on the top. Some beer "purists" regard the process as being unnatural because it really messes with the flavor of the beer. An example of a beer that uses Nitro is Guinness. When you open a can of Guinness, a nitrogen "ball" activates to carbonate the beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For a keg system to pour beer without excessive foam, the system must be balanced, and the serving line/faucet free of obstructions. Serving beer at too high a pressure, or through a half-open faucet/tap agitates the beer, causing the foam you saw. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The system is balanced by having the pressure inside the keg set to just a touch more (0.5-1psi) than the pressure resistance outside the keg. The pressure resistance outside the keg comes from the beer line and the tap - the longer the beer line, the more resistance. Also any increase in height between the keg and the end of the tap will increase resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But even if the system was originally balanced, with the right dispensing pressure or adequate length of beer line, there are still some things working against you:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;if the keg has been sloshed about, some of the carbon dioxide will have come out of the beer and into the headspace, creating more pressure. It takes several days for this to equalize again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;as the keg warms, the pressure inside the keg increases, since gas has a higher pressure at higher temperature with the same volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you have a keg that is overpressured, you have 3 basic options:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;reduce the pressure inside the keg by venting some of the gas. Some kegs have a pressure relief valve that can be pulled to reduce pressure. But do it in small bursts, and try the beer after each until you see that the beer comes out not to quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;increase the resistance outside the keg by using a longer beer line and/or placing the keg somewhere low and serving the beer higher. (e.g. keg at ground level and stand up to serve the beer.)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;dispense a large amount beer to a large jug - removing beer from the keg will reduce the pressure in the keg, and keeping it in a jug gives time for the head on the beer to settle down. While you're waiting, just pour some more beer from the keg - this will come out slower and have less foam.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;see&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://byo.com/stories/item/164-balancing-your-draft-system-advanced-brewing"&gt;balancing your draft system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, there are currently beers that are served warm, particularly very dark ones.  So part of it has to do with the character of beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are two important factors I see, looking at this as a history nut but not knowing of any sources on this topic.  The first, as you say, is widespread refrigeration.  But this was not the major factor in cold beverages generally since ice was often preserved into the summer for cooling beverages (and has been since ancient times).  But refrigeration makes this easier and thus cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The second is actually the modern bottlecap which is a product of industrialization.  Before the bottlecap most beers were served uncarbonated.  They might be chilled or not, but they would have been entirely uncarbonated, shipped in wooden barrels, etc. and had an altogether different flavor and character than our modern beers.  My experience playing with these concepts as a homebrewer suggests that such beers were better suited to being served warm than comparably dark carbonated beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To understand why, I think you have to look at carbonation and how temperature affects that.  Carbon dioxide is more soluble in cold water than warm water, so the warmer the beer is, the faster it goes flat, and the more it fizzes when opened.  So you have two ways carbonation affects the picture.  First it impacts the taste and serving conditions differently at different temperatures, and secondly it imparts a distinctive off-tang when the beer goes flat.  Temperature helps offset the latter to a mild extent but at the expense of the former.  I think this also helps explain why richer beers are more often served warm than lighter beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would say that the condensate amounts to no more than 1ml for a 500ml glass, which is a 0.2% dilution. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;No to be too coarse, but I imagine most people dilute the beer more after taking a sip! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Comparatively, I think the excessively cold temperature will contribute more to destroying the flavor than a small amount of condensate from the glass. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, if you enjoy the beer in a frozen glass, then keep at it. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Basically, they are experts in beer. They are knowledgeable in everything from the brewing process and the beer styles to properly serving beer and how to pair it with food. Yes, there are certification programs around, such as &lt;a href="http://www.cicerone.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not sure about training, but it seems like it involves a series of exams, much like actuarial exams or the FE and PE for engineers. &lt;a href="http://www.craftbeer.com/craft-beer-muses/beer-experts-and-cicerone" rel="nofollow"&gt;craftbeer.com has a great article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In France we're told that you should always rince the glass with a bit of cold water before serving to remove any trace of dust which will make the foam smoother.&lt;br&gt;
					Since you're not supposed to dry it afterward, I guess that would dilute the beer more than the fozen condensation and it's still not enough water to have any impact on the flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Today they're largely just traditional.  However, originally they helped:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;li&gt;To keep the beer cool by preventing airflow from above.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;To keep insects and other contaminants out.&lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Cask ales are not stored under pressure , and require a pump to transfer the beer from the cask.  As the ale is not under pressure, it is also not as heavily carbonated as other beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In contrast kegged beer is stored under pressure, and is forced to the tap by pumping gas into the keg (usually carbon dioxide or nitrogen).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Cask beer is not kept under pressure whereas Keg beer is (with CO2 or a nitrogen mixture).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beers served in Cask vs Keg (w/ CO2) vs Keg (w/ Nitro) will have slightly different tastes and appearances.  Cask beer will be a "flatter" due to the lack of pressure keeping the CO2 in solution in the beer.  Cask beer can also take on a butterscotch flavor due to the exposure to air.  Hoppy beers will be mellowed in the Cask vs in a Keg.  Beer in a cask needs to be drank within a few days of opening the cask due to the exposure to oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Kegs served with CO2 are typically how beers are served.  If the keg is using a Nitro tap, the beer will get a smoother milky texture due to the gas and the head will cascade in waves.  The beer will last much longer in a keg because of the gas keeping oxygen away from the beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pour it over the back of a spoon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As with any layered beer, your goal is to reduce the velocity of the top beer as it hits the bottom beer.  So, pour it over the back of a spoon to split the stream up into smaller rivulets (which won't push as far into the lower beer):&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dennisjudd.com/albums/beers/test2.gif" rel="noreferrer"&gt;http://dennisjudd.com/albums/beers/test2.gif&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For advanced drinkers, bend a spoon handle so that you can lower the spoon further into the glass while still keeping the spoon head perpendicular to the table.  This means that the beer doesn't have as far to fall from the spoon into the glass-beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The technique of making a layered beer takes a little practice, so give it a few tries (and drink all of your mistakes!)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Apart from the simple explanation of people liking the foam, the lack of head could indicate problems with the beer.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could mean that the glass is dirty, or there is left over soap residue on the glass.  This can affect the taste of the beer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could indicate that the beer has lost its carbonation (the head being formed by the gas quickly coming out of solution in the beer).  For many forms of storage a lack of internal pressure will indicate that they are no longer sealed properly, which makes it easier for infections to enter the beer or for it to oxidise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for the ideal amount of head, to some extent it will depend on the style of beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, a good head helps release the aromas of the beer, especially the hops. Aroma is everything for enjoyment of a good brew. When enjoying a super-hoppy IPA, you should always use a glass that provides a large surface area for aromatics to rise from.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It can also provide the a pleasant mouth feel. Stouts definitely benefit from a thick, silky head.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And lastly, it's eye candy.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for the right amount of head, it varies. Generally in an average pint glass you want 1-2 finger-widths of head. Some hefeweizens and wit beers are best with a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As mentioned by @Fishtoaster (and as depicted in the cat gif) pouring over the back of a spoon is definitely a must - you really want to make sure none of the top layer breaks into the bottom layer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a few other ways to make your layering more effective as well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As seen in the animated gif, a curved beer glass is used. Ideally, you want it to have this shape&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.kegerator.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/weizen_glass.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;http://blog.kegerator.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/weizen_glass.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you use a regular pint glass it will have a greater potential of mixing the layers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A common mistake when making these layers is to get as close to 50% as possible. The downside is that as you drink it, it will mix with these portions. Ideally, you should be looking at a 70% base, 30% top in order to have &lt;em&gt;and maintain&lt;/em&gt; two defined layers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You want to have enough beer so that a person would be able to see the head profile along with getting a good look at the color/clarity of the beer.  Along with being able to take 2 - 3 sips of the beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A tasting would be a larger pour as this would be more of a friendly gathering and you want the people to enjoy the beer, I would aim for 4 - 6 oz.  It is also not too much if they don't like it.  For a tasting, you don't really care if people are getting drunk.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For a competition since you are not aiming to really "drink" the beer, I would say that it would probably be 2 - 3 oz.  Judges are going to aim to not get drunk on the beer, so the smaller pour helps with that.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are two angles to consider &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;what is best for the beer&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;what is best for the tasting scenario&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For the beer, a serving size that is appropriate should:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;provide sufficient beer to not warm up excessively in the cup or glass in the minute or two tasting is underway. This means serving sizes should be at least 60ml/2 oz. (If the beer is served too cold, leave it in the bottle to warm, so that all samples are poured together and tasted at the same temperature.)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For the tasting situation we have to consider:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may be a limited amount of an evaluation beer to share between the number of judges so serving sizes should be restrained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, some additional beer should be left over in case a re-evaluation is necessary. This is particularly important with styles where volatiles are a key contributor, since they dissipate quickly, plus the olfactory sense quickly becomes tired, requiring a pause and then a fresh sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Taking these two into account gives a typical serving size in the order of 3-4oz/75-100ml.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Note that the glass can be larger - particularly a long tall glass is good for capturing the aromatics of a smaller sample.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1603420894" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tasting Beer&lt;/a&gt; by Randy Mosher is by far the most valuable beer book I've ever read.  It covers the styles you'll encounter, the flavors, the technology, the history, the science, and more.  I was a fairly knowledgeable beer enthusiast when I read it, but I wish I'd read it ten years earlier.  If I had, it would have increased my enjoyment of getting to know beer ten-fold by increasing my  understanding of what I was drinking.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally as a rule of thumb I would allow my choice to be dictated by the level of carbonation in the beer. Temperature affects how rapidly carbon dioxide dissipates from the beer, so the more carbon dioxide it starts with, the colder I would serve it, in order to preserve it in its intended state for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My personal taste would also entail a slightly cooler temperature for pale ale styles (lighter in colour and body and hoppier) and slightly warmer for brown ales, bitters, stouts and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would also like to register my objection to the term 'warm' used for beer. I don't know of any drinking culture that really does encourage the &lt;em&gt;warm&lt;/em&gt; serving of beer in any normal understanding of the word. 'Warm' really refers to cellar temperature rather than refrigerator or just-above-zero temperature. A similar temperature to that you'd expect in red wine would be appropriate for the 'warm' beers. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can decant the beer between two large glasses or pitchers - the agitation will cause the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to come out of solution quickly and also not raise the temperature too much. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sample after 4-5 decants to see how much the carbonation has dropped, and repeat as necessary. You will end up with quite a bit of foam, hence the need for larger glasses or a pitcher.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;How long do you leave them in the fridge before you open them?  Making sure they've had a good several hours to chill may mitigate the explosion.  You could also try a homebrewer's trick, which is to chill them really cold, pop the caps all off then put new caps on.  You would need a &lt;a href="http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/brewing/brewing-equipment/bottling/bottle-cappers/red-baron-emily-capper.html"&gt;bottle capper&lt;/a&gt; to do this.  They're fairly cheap but you probably wouldn't have them unless you were or knew a homebrewer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, your best course of action may actually be to contact Hitachino.  Gushing bottles are often a sign of a wild yeast infection, so it's possible you may have just gotten some bad beer that got mishandled in shipping or something messed up on the bottling line and they missed it.  They may replace the pack or at least give you some other cool stuff to make up for the mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As stated earlier, temperature is a matter of taste regarding beer. Necessity may also play a part (Given a choice between a warm beer vs no beer it depends how thirsty you are!).&lt;br&gt;
					German-style lagers are almost exclusively recommended to be served no lower than 6°C (43°F)no higher than 9°C (49°F), but I often find that the last (and warmest) mouthfuls from a glass actually have the most flavour - but I would always start with the lager cold when possible.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Real ales are a different story. On the continent of Europe there still seems to be a myth that British drink their beer 'luke-warm', but if served at that temperature most Brits would complain (and maybe continue to drink it while complaining). I believe the phrase 'serve cool' rather than 'cold' applies. Some live, bottled beers actually suffer from being too cold. On of my favourites, Black Sheep Ale develops a 'chill haze' - going a little cloudy if left in the fridge too long. 13°C (55°F)is about right for such beers.
					Reference the book Beer For Dummies!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This isn't the "best" answer but a dab of soap (think back to grade school science) with help break up the bubbles and bring that head down real fast&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Soap is absolutely the worst thing you could do I guess :P.
					Sometimes I notice that badly dried glasses (with soap rests) produce more foam...
					In general, make sure your glass is spotlessly clean. You could then either leave it dry or make it a little wet, works sometimes...
					Keep your glass diagonal to make sure the liquid touches the glass almost parallel to the glass' inner side.
					Then when pouring, make sure you have a slow and fluent ray of beer that doesn't splash out of your bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I can imagine multiple reasons. I assume that Rothaus owns the patents to this kind of glueless neckpaper fixing what leds to a feeling belonging to the 1337 group of zäpfle-fans as the common germann biertrinker is always prowd of his local beer. First, this kind of wrapping the top makes sence from an hyenic point of view. Second, since they wrap their aluminium foil, which is thick compared to others, not just around the neck but also over the cab, you may have realised that the artifacts caused from opening the bottle feels uncomfortable on the lips. But most important, biertrinkers are way conservative on anything related to their local beer. Prost!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm from Germany. Don't care too much about this. Just remove that part of it which would be disturbing when drinking, since some minor pieces might get into the glass or into your mouth directly if you are drinking out of the bottle, which is common in Germany, except in a restaurant or during a dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also you wouldn't normally remove the gold paper &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; opening the bottle. Most of the parts will getting removed &lt;em&gt;automatically&lt;/em&gt; when opening it. You just need to remove the remaining, disturbing parts, if there are any left. Try it! ;)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That's all you need to know. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes, they do.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A new experiment done jointly by Stanford University and the University of Edinburgh has finally proven that when beer is poured into a glass, the bubbles sometimes go down.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"Bubbles are lighter than beer, so they're supposed to rise upward,"&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;– Richard N. Zare, the Professor of Natural Sciences at Stanford. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"But countless drinkers have claimed that the bubbles actually go down the side of the glass. Could they be right, or would that defy the laws of physics?"&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In 1999, Australian researchers announced that they had created a computer model showing it was  possible for beer bubbles to flow downward.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But Zare and former Stanford post doctoral fellow Andrew J. Alexander were unconvinced by the virtual Guinness model and decided to put it to the test by analysing it physically.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"Indeed, Andy and I first disbelieved this and wondered if the people had had maybe too much Guinness to drink," Zare recalled. "We tried our own experiments, which were fun but inconclusive. So Andy got hold of a camera that takes 750 frames a second and recorded some rather gorgeous video clips of what was happening."&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A careful analysis of the video confirmed findings: Beer bubbles do sink.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"The answer turns out to be really very simple. It's based on the idea of what goes up has to come down. In this case, the bubbles go up more easily in the centre of the beer glass than on the sides because of drag from the walls. As they go up, they raise the beer, and the beer has to spill back, and it does. It runs down the sides of the glass carrying the bubbles -- particularly little bubbles -- with it, downward. After a while it stops, but it's really quite dramatic and it's easy to demonstrate."&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon also occurred in other beers, said Alexander&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"The bubbles are small enough to be pushed down by the liquid. We've shown you can do this with any liquid, really -- water with a fizzing tablet in it, for example."&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;"It's just paying attention to the world around you and trying to figure out why things happen the way they do..."&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2004/bubbles317.html"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some brewers design glasses to enhance the experience of the beer in various ways.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;IPAs in general benefit from a large opening to release as much aroma as possible, but there are other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I know Guinness in particular has designed a very special glass for their beer. The &lt;a href="http://www.drinkstuff.com/products/product.asp?ID=6480#.VBxccvldXPs" rel="nofollow"&gt;special glass&lt;/a&gt; features their golden harp, which you are supposed to aim for when pouring. This and the special curvatures of the glass help give the beer a good head and keep it until you're done with the beer. Stouts especially benefit from a silky, creamy head, so Guinness designed a glass around that.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've never had Kwak, but from the looks of the glass it seems to be more of a branding effort than anything else. I can't imagine any potential benefits from a glass that shape.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_glassware#Belgian_and_Dutch_styles" rel="nofollow"&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; article is a good read. It tells you what beer goes in what glass and why.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Actually, the glass does serve a purpose. &lt;a href="http://gloriousfoodandwinebelgianbeer.blogspot.com/2005/10/belgian-beer-no3-kwak-and-interesting.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;This site&lt;/a&gt; says the glass was invented for coachmen who weren't able to leave the horses and have some beer. The glass's peculiar shape allows it to be hung on the side of the coach for easy drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer with hops will get skunky shortly after exposure to sun light. Exposure of about 15 seconds and you can smell the change start if you hold it to your nose in bright sun light.  I have one and use it during outdoor barbecues.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My Austrian father-in-law tells me that they're also handy for keeping ashes out of your beer. I don't smoke, so that had never really occurred to me until he mentioned it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beers that are high in ABV, have been bottle-conditioned or have been barrel-aged are prime for aging and cellaring. Usually the brewer will say on the bottle or their website what the max amount of suggested aging time is. For instance, Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout state "develops over 5 years in the bottle." I bought a case of 2012 and have one about every 6 months...and they get better and better.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;They should have been kept at about 50-55 degrees over the time of aging. What did you have them at?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just wanted to add to some of the already great answers…&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Although it has been mentioned what the characteristics of Nitro are, and why that might be good for the beer drinking experience, it hasn't really been said why to use it or rather why its used in lieu of CO2. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It was mentioned that the historical carbonation process was very different, but nobody has connected the two, so I figure I'll add a little input to hopefully color in a bit more. A lot of the reason for carbonation is to preserve the beer. By replacing the oxygen in the keg the beer will last longer. Now we associate the carbonation with beer but that was not always there traditionally. While it is true that older beer bottled from barrel storage was carbonated during bottling it wasn't mentioned that historically beer was poured from the cask and therefore not carbonated beyond natural carbonation. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cask&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In this string cask beer wasn't mentioned but it is literally from the barrel. It is the smoothest and creamiest way to "tap" beer. It's also considered the best by many purists. It however has a huge limitation in modern applications. The barrels don't last as long and thereby need to be smaller, swapped out more often, and potentially wasted if not used quick enough. For this reason most businesses opt for the larger, easier, cheaper carbonated kegs. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As stated before by Jeffrey Lin the Nitro is a newer solution but I have to take exception to his explanation of the unnatural side of Nitro. Really the purists are fine with nitro. They may not be particularly fond of the "in-can" nitro widget, but really the process just replaces a larger CO2 bubble with the smaller finer bubbles of dissolved nitrogen and thereby some dissolved C02 as well. Purists truly would be more likely to enjoy a cask pour but as Nitro, in a lot of ways, is closer to cask both in consistency and the "creaminess" described it goes without saying this would be enjoyed by the purists as well. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of Beer for Nitro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are many types of beer where smooth finer bubbles are appropriate. Guinness being only one that comes to mind but really most British milds. Also English ales, pales and creams just to mention a few. The older styles from England were flat compared to American lagers and most modern beers. Another good example is a Boddingtons. Finer bubbles fit the mold with anything that traditionally would be served from the cask. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As with most new technology it serves a purpose and in this case the purpose is two-fold. Store without oxygen to prevent going bad, and keep with the original intended style of those types of beers. The discussion of flavor change is slightly off because flavor change would only be present if oxygen were allowed to be present in the beer when kegged. Texture change is more accurate and the nitro is an effort to more closely approximate that. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hope that is helpful to fill in some details and thanks to Sloloem for helping, hopefully it is more easily digestable/readable? It may not be science but historically speaking it might be philosophy…&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You need to pour carefully as normally you have quite thick tankage and/or parts of kvass (sometimes bread pieces and crumbs if it`s homemade one) can float in it. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My ancestors (and still my relatives) use limestone cellar to keep temperature-sensitive goods (including kvass) and the cellar`s floor is 3 meters below their ground level. At summer it's chilling cold down there and the Internet says the temperatures there fall into range of 5-10 degrees celsius (pretty much the temperature in a fridge). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Kvass is one of the best beverages for hot summer and if brewed good it`s as tasty as beer and contains almost no alcohol so you can continue doing any type of work you've been doing prior to drinking it (beer does not really have this wonderful feature). However the best one is hand-made at home as kvass sold in supermarkets is not good and sometimes it differs drastically (imagine a difference between a home-made lemonade from a restaurant and any bottle of one from a supermarket).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think kvas tastes best when it is cold. In Moscow, say, when you are walking around in the summer, you see many stands with cooled containers where you can buy it. This type of kvas is not bad, but the best kvas is often made by some monastery &lt;a href="http://www.stsl.ru/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;like the one in Sergiev Posad&lt;/a&gt; - see the photo. The difference to standard types is huge.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Having the right shaped drinkware can improve the taste of beer.  For example, there's very specific reasons for the shape of a weizen vase, or a pilsner.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, more often than not unusual shaped glasses are about branding and nothing more.  In &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosteels_Brewery" rel="nofollow"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; wikipedia article it is claimed that the fancy Kwak beer glasses (which I like incidentally) were not launched until the 1980s.  IF that is true, their claim that it was designed for couchmen  unable to leave their horses rings a bit hollow...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I do think that although the flavor of your beer is paramount, there's a lot more to how you enjoy your beer than 'just' flavor.  Company, environment, and a beautiful glass or mug all contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Just like wine, pour into a glass while watching the sediment.
					 Make sure the bottle has sat still for long enough that everything has settled. Stop when the sediment is about to pour out.
					Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some things to consider:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you don't tap a beer every so often, the beer that is left in regular beer faucets can dry out and lock the tap shut.  I suggest a &lt;a href="https://www.perlick.com/bar-beverage-equipment/beverage-dispensing/tapping-hardwarecomponents/beer-faucets/" rel="nofollow"&gt;perlick&lt;/a&gt; faucet as it seals without drying out.  I've used mine for years without any "sticky tap" problems.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are going to have a tower on top of the fridge, the beer line in the tower will warm up to the ambient room temperature.  This means that the first part of the first pour of the night will be very foamy as the pressure is different in the warm tower.  Some way of insulating the tower or circulating the air inside the tower will ensure the quality of the beer in the line.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When cutting the top of the fridge, be very careful to avoid damaging the cooling lines (if there are any in the top) as that will destroy the cooling ability on that wall of the refrigerator.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're keeping it in the garage, you may want to consider some way of sealing the tap when you're done for the night.  A plug will prevent flies or ants from enjoying your beer while you're out.  A lock will prevent any neighbors from doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Probably not as direct as a link to a conversion kit, but hopefully this will help you decide.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In general, beers that are served with nitro tend to be smoother than their CO2 counterpart. Personally, I've had Left Handed Milk Stout Nitro and Standard side by side and much preferred the Nitro version.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Depends on who you ask. Both of these answers are correct but some would take the definition of cask ale a little further by defining it as an ale that is unfiltered and unpasteurised and conditioned (including secondary fermentation) and served from a cask without additional nitrogen or carbon dioxide pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One of our local beer shops has a few cask ales on tap, ran by someone from England. He often scolds beer sold as cask ales which were only placed into the cask after fermentation is completed.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_glassware" rel="nofollow"&gt;Beer glasses&lt;/a&gt; are mainly a product of the region in which the beer was originated and therefore tied to a specific beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Belgian beers - Normally served in &lt;a href="http://www.ohio.com/polopoly_fs/1.457872!/image/image.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_500/hullabaloo.png" rel="nofollow"&gt;goblets&lt;/a&gt; because the beers have very complex aromas and the shape of the glass can help present and concentrate them for consumption.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;British beers - Normally served in the "&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=images&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwisj7zvsZTKAhUU5mMKHQIIAIgQjRwIAw&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAuthentic-British-Imperial-nonic-Etched%2Fdp%2FB007A0OZFE&amp;amp;psig=AFQjCNEv-ePikHEN5cnuMubUwDuS70vW7g&amp;amp;ust=1452142330583350" rel="nofollow"&gt;nonic&lt;/a&gt;" glass.  Simply a glass that is easier to hold in the hand whilst standing around the pub. Normally associated with most British ales.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Pilsner - High sided &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=images&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjb2qXFspTKAhUW7mMKHQyeCAsQjRwIAw&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FKitchen-Tall-Beer-Glasses-14-4oz-410ml%2Fdp%2FB00BMGWVBC&amp;amp;psig=AFQjCNEgUeJUiOw0x1O2jGuwy-cLwqvEUg&amp;amp;ust=1452142510579203" rel="nofollow"&gt;flute&lt;/a&gt; to concentrate the hop aroma and show off the high carbonation of Pilsners.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weissbeir - German wheat beers are usually served in &lt;a href="http://transatlanticbrews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Craft-beer-glasses-at-Joes-Wine-Cellar.jpg" rel="nofollow"&gt;tall glasses&lt;/a&gt; to show off the cloudy beer and also the creamy tall head of foam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scottish Ale - a &lt;a href="http://www.homebrewtalk.com/gallery/data/1/thistleor.jpg" rel="nofollow"&gt;Thistle glass&lt;/a&gt; designed to evoke the image of the national flower of Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It might sound snobbish to be peckish about the type of glass but the glass does influence the taste of the beer. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some things are:
					 - the thickness of the glass. A thin glass invites to a more delicate way of drinking, a really thick glass would let you expect a sturdier beer.
					 - the surface compared to the volume of beer. A big surface gives a change to let of more aroma's but I would think you also need a little more foam.
					 - the capacity to keep the aroma's. As pointed out by Rube. Think of a cognac glass versus a &lt;a href="http://www.bierwoordenboek.com/getfile.aspx?file=Glazen%2FAmsterdammer.gif" rel="nofollow"&gt;vase&lt;/a&gt;. Some glasses also take in you nose deeper than others.
					 - the way the beer flows. The shape of the glass how quickly you can drink it without spilling. Think of &lt;a href="http://www.potjebier.nl/bier_glazen.asp?f=show&amp;amp;id=14" rel="nofollow"&gt;kwak&lt;/a&gt;, you HAVE to drink the last very carefully.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So to answer your question: there are many factors how the glass influences how you taste a beer. What's best is very subjective. You could at first stick to the opinion of the brewer, what he finds the best glass for it. If you like the taste with an other glass better, use that. I would not approach this as a hard science. Brewers might choose a specific glass to "stand out".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The steins with their lids seem to have come about as a result of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubonic_plague" rel="nofollow"&gt;
					bubonic plague&lt;/a&gt; to serve as sanitary measure and thus keep flies and other insects (fleas) out of the beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;From about 1340 until 1380, a bubonic plague, or Black Death, killed more than 25 million Europeans! As horrible as this historic event was, it prompted tremendous progress for civilization. And, of interest here, it is also responsible for the origin of the beer stein.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Recall from above that the distinction between a mug and a stein is the hinged lid. This lid was originally conceived entirely as a &lt;strong&gt;sanitary measure&lt;/strong&gt;. During the summers of the late 1400s, hoards of little flies frequently invaded Central Europe. By the early 1500s, several principalities in what is now Germany had passed laws requiring that all food and beverage containers be covered to protect consumers against these dirty insects. The common mug also had to be covered, and this was accomplished by adding a hinged lid with a thumblift. This ingenious invention was soon used to cover all German beverage containers while still allowing them to be used with one hand. - &lt;a href="http://www.beerstein.net/articles/bsb-1.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;A Brief History of Beer Steins.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Collating Darwin and jalynn's answers and some experience running a real ale bar:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the UK, real ales will always be served from a hand pump, as per the &lt;a href="http://www.camra.org.uk/faq" rel="nofollow"&gt;definition from CAMRA:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Real ale is a beer brewed from traditional ingredients (malted barley, hops water and yeast), matured by secondary fermentation in the container from which it is dispensed, and served without the use of extraneous carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But you will always see Carlsberg, Budweiser, Heineken, Guinness, Stella etc pumped using CO2. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you haven't seen them, it must be down to the pubs you frequent :-)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When you joined the army the final part of recruitment was to be paid a shilling.  When the recruiters came to a village they would go to the local bar to try to persuade young men to join.  One way to do this was to put a shilling in the tankard.  I'm not sure if that is the reason for glass bottom tankards though, anyone rich enough to own one would probably be to old to fight.  Another story is the glass bottom was so you could see a punch coming when you had the tankard raised.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally I think it is just so you can see if the beer is cloudy.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The origins of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_shilling" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;King's Shilling&lt;/a&gt; seems to have appeared about the time of the &lt;a href="http://www.warof1812.ca/recruit.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;War of 1812&lt;/a&gt;, because of the need for recruitment was so necessary due to the fact that the English were already at war with France.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Recruiting parties scoured the countryside and city streets for able-bodied soldiers. In his arsenal of weapons, the recruiting Sergeant offered any perspective recruit a bounty of over two month’s worth of wages to enlist. Some were offered the option to enlist for limited time of service, usually a 7-year term, and receive a smaller bounty, but most chose the other option: service for life. Calculating one’s options in life must have been difficult for the recruit in a noisy, smoke-filled Ale House after consuming a number of gills of rum, happily provided by a member of the recruiting party. While the recruiting prospect drank endless rounds from the punch bowl, his ears were filled with stories of an easy life as a soldier, quick promotion and how women to could not help but be drawn to a man in a red coat. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The members of a recruiting party were all quite motivated in convincing say a young weaver or labourer to join as each was paid handsomely for each recruit they brought before the army surgeon for inspection and got attested by a Justice of the Peace. If the potential recruit hesitated to enlisted, deception was applied. A recruiting sergeant recounted:&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;…your last recourse was to get him drunk, and then slip a shilling in his pocket, get him home to your billet, and next morning swear he enlisted, bring all your party to prove it, get him persuaded to pass the doctor. Should he pass, you must try every means in your power to get him to drink, blow him up with a fine story, get him inveigled to the magistrates, in some shape or other, and get him attested; but by no means let him out of your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Why the expression &lt;a href="http://www.royalscotsgrenadiers.com/kingsshilling.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;To Take The King's Shilling:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The expression 'to take the king's shilling', meant to sign up to join the army. Rather like with the 'prest' money for the 'impressed' man, a bonus payment of a shilling was offered to tempt lowly paid workers to leave their trade (an average daily wage during the Napoleonic period was 2p (at 12p to a shilling, this represented six days wages in one go). Once the shilling had been accepted, it was almost impossible to leave the army.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Since the army was not seen as an attractive career, recruiting sergeants often had to use less than honest methods to secure their 'prey', such as getting the recruitee drunk, slipping the shilling into his pocket and then hauling him before the magistrate the following morning (still hungover) to get him to accept the fact that he was now in the army. Sometimes the 'King's shilling' was hidden in the bottom of a pewter tankard (having drunk his pint, the unfortunate drinker found that he had unwittingly accepted the King's offer). As a result, some tankards were made with glass bottoms. Other recruits came from the courts, where a criminal's sentence could be commuted to service in the army - still the case (apparently) with the Blackwatch Regiment.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;In fact the bounty for joining the army was much larger than a shilling. New recruits received £23.17s.6d, but out of this they were obliged to buy their uniform - a not inconsiderable expence.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is a picture of the &lt;a href="https://shop.nmrn.org.uk/products/kings-shilling-tankard" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;King's Shilling Tankard&lt;/a&gt; in question:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I don't think anyone would deliberately or professionally serve &lt;em&gt;warm&lt;/em&gt; beer, if by warm you mean something close to body temperature. Generally speaking, cask ale (as opposed to pressurised keg beer) is served, in the UK at least, and according to CAMRA's website, at cellar temperature: 12-14 C (54-57 F), whereas lager and keg beer is usually served much colder.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So much for the purist. My preference is always for cask ale to be served cool, but not cold, so that the flavours can be properly appreciated. Good quality lager should be served colder, and I prefer Czech pilsners at around 6-8 C - about the same temperature as you'd want white wine to be. But on a burning hot day in the African sunshine (where I'm from), there is nothing as refreshing as an ice-cold (and I mean &lt;strong&gt;ice&lt;/strong&gt;-cold) ordinary mass-market lager, straight out of the bottle. You can't distinguish tastes as readily at those temperatures. Refreshment is the key there: you don't really care about taste in those circumstances (if you did you'd be drinking something else).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it that some beers are served Cold and why are some served Warm?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;At what temperature should a beer be served can be answered by the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Most beers have an ideal serving temperature. There’s a chart below outlining which styles are served at what temperature, but as a general rule the temperature at which to serve a beer is correlated to the strength of the beer. &lt;strong&gt;As beers go up in alcohol, they are generally drunk at a warmer temperature.&lt;/strong&gt; This is because stronger beers often are sipped slowly, and enjoyed for their complexity of flavor and aroma while weaker beers are often consumed for refreshment. For no style is this more apparent than American macro lagers, which are generally drunk so cold that you can’t taste them. There’s a reason those big brewers want people to drink their beers at tongue-numbing temperatures. As they warm up, they don’t taste very good. - &lt;a href="http://craftbeertemple.com/videoblog/serving-beer/" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Craft Beer Temple.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So... the short answer is novelty... and possibly, less beer loss per firkin if the CO2 is causing the beer to be head-y and a lot of beer gets wasted when bartenders pour through the foam.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The more complex answer is - as long as a beer is in a metal firkin... there should be no discerning difference in quality/taste/etc. The difference would come in the form of wooden firkins. If, for example, you had a Stout on tap and the same stout served in a wooden firkin, the longer the beer stayed in the wooden firkin, the more the flavors would change. Especially if the wooden firkin was previously used to make a spirit (like bourbon).  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the latter - bourbon barrrel - the longer the beer stays in, the more of the bourbon flavor shines through.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I must say that before starting to brew myself I disliked the head, but when you start to deal with low carbonated beer, it becomes interesting. Just bought this weird "head maker" an ultra-beer thing it is really weird, looks like a sex toy, but creates head with ultrasound. Just stick it in the beer and press the bottom.
					With some beers it definitely adds flavor, especially hoppy beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes the same beer from a cask and a keg will be VERY different.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To your first point, breweries and bars will often have specially treated casks in ways that are impossible to do with kegs.  Stuff like dry-hopping the beer in the cask at the bar so it's at its freshest and most intense.  With a keg you'd need to put this between the tap and the glass like a Randall but with a cask you can just pop the cap and shove whatever you want in there.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Casked beer also generally still have active yeast in it, at least according to CAMRA's rules, while kegs are filtered and have no yeast in them.  Because of this there's a lot of preparation involved in a proper real ale cask.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cask will come sealed from the brewery.  First a soft spile or peg must be driven into the top hole.  This is just a porous plug that allows air out.  Based on how foamy this gets the bar can see how active the yeast is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the yeast dies down the soft spile gets replaced with a hard spile which stops gas exchange.  The cask then has to sit for a while so all the yeast can fall to the bottom as well as any other particulates or large proteins in the beer.  This is called "Dropping Bright"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, once the beer has dropped bright the cask can be tapped which involves removing the hard spile and also either hooking up the side hole to a beer engine or a simple tap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Because of all this and traditionally being served from a cellar or bartop at "cellar temperature" vs kegs which are refrigerated the beer that comes out will be slightly warmer (40-50F vs 30-40F), much slower because of the pumping and off-gassing from the pour, and way less carbonated.  Some beer engines will also use "sparkler" taps that fizz up the beer even more on the way out to generate more head but also results in a less carbonated beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The result is a beer that will generally be smoother and rounder, you may get more flavor and more sweetness since it's warmer.  Some flavors will come out more in the warmer and less carbonated and some will be overshadowed.  Mouthfeel will be affected a lot by both factors as well.  It's a hugely different animal and sometimes people like it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a safe bet, dry still red wines should be served between 18-20°C
					Of course exceptions apply... &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Opening time prior to service depends on the vintage, older wines (4+ years) need to breathe longer than young wines (0-3 years).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Knowing what kind of wine you have would help, denomination and vintage being the most useful information.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;An excellent practice is also read the wine back label. In some cases there is information about the "serving temprature" and also this maybe can be found on the winnery webpage. Some wineries web site are in their local language as well as English.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is very broad so I will stick to wine in my answer. There are many considerations for pouring, you have the aesthetic aspects and presentation, and you have the mechanical aspects which can change the properties of the served drink. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For wine, the waitress was right from a presentation point of view when served in a fine dining setting. Holding the bottle by the base gives the server the maximum reach with good control, twisting at the end helps reduce drips, the napkin can be used for any cleanup quickly, and showing the label assures the customer they are being served the wine of their choice. This technique does not effect the consumption, if you are entertaining at home there's no right or wrong way really, although I find the hold and twist give me the same advantages when I'm serving wine at my table. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From a mechanical aspect, with wine the major considerations are sediment with red wines and bubbles with sparkling wine. If you have a red wine with sediment you need to be careful to not shake up the bottle and to leave the dregs in the bottom as you pour (or decant it through a strainer). With sparkling wine you need to be sure not to overfill. With most wines how you pour it makes no detectable difference on the flavor. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Guinness' perfect-pour is actually a &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/lukebailey/guinness-two-pour-is-the-greatest-marketing-con?utm_term=.fe9VL8MP6#.cjL0vGm3y" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;marketing scheme&lt;/a&gt; that gives them an &lt;em&gt;exclusivity&lt;/em&gt; factor. They have training courses and will invite patrons that visit Guinness to become masters of &lt;em&gt;The Perfect Pour.&lt;/em&gt; However, it has no real impact on the beer.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The actual answer to pouring is much less mystic and much more scientific. The pour does matter for several different reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First - Why does foaming occur? Carbon Dioxide is actually in solution inside of the beer. Several things play a factor; but, the biggest two are temperature and pressure. CO2 goes into solution easily around 36ºF &lt;a href="http://www.draughtquality.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Carbonation_PH-Final_1.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;(Here is a link to a slide that lists the temperature and PSI of beer)&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore - the warmer the beer when poured, the more head you tend to get (because the CO2 is leaving solution). The other big reason is pressure differentials - inside the keg/can/bottle the pressure is keeping the CO2 in solution. When the pressure outside is less than in the keg (like when you open a beer bottle or pour the beer) the CO2 starts escaping.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The reason pour matters is really the following mixture of craftsmanship and business. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Head retention (or the froth that stays at the top of your beer) is really important! It gives off &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of aromatics that you get to experience before even tasting the beer. When you make beer - the hops added at the beginning of the process give the bittering falvors that balance the malty-sweetness while hops added toward the end (or even during fermentation) impart less bittering and more aromatics. Therefore, a lot of the &lt;a href="https://food-hacks.wonderhowto.com/how-to/beer-science-pour-perfect-glass-beer-every-single-time-0150843/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;beer's personality&lt;/a&gt; shines through the foamy-head. Let's be honest... what beer lover doesn't think that the way a freshly poured Left-Hand Nitro Stout (or other beers that have that tan-cascade of CO2 falling away from the head) is beautiful?&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;For businesses foamy-pours are money wasters. &lt;a href="https://turbotapusa.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;This link&lt;/a&gt; from TurboTapsUSA describes why their tap is a money saver. It comes down to lost beer. We know that a beer with foam 3 inches from the top turns into a beer with only about 1.5 inches of space from the top. So, when you see bartenders or others pouring until there is just beer to the top while foam pours out in the drain are just wasting money. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Glass shape plays a big part in foaming. Nucleation sites help create carbonation &lt;a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/community/threads/glassware-nucleated-vs-non-nucleated.210694/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;(discussed at length in this forum)&lt;/a&gt;. When you want a lot of head retention, this is a good thing. There is also a reason that &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/300/what-glasses-are-meant-for-which-beers-and-why"&gt;glassware is shaped the way it is&lt;/a&gt;. It allows smells from the foam to be directed towards the imbiber's nose, allows the drink to breathe like wine, or keeps your hands from warming up the beer too much. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A site that has a lot of useful information is &lt;a href="https://www.craftbeer.com/beer-styles" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;craftbeer.com&lt;/a&gt;. By going to the beer styles section, you will see the beer style information, including serving temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you want to go more in depth, you can get training from &lt;a href="https://www.cicerone.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Cicerone&lt;/a&gt;. They are a company that train bar staff on the the correct way to serve beer (temp, glasses,food pairing, etc) as well as information about the beer styles, brewing process and more.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I believe the lid was also used during the Revolutionary War to keep the Kings  naval soldiers from throwing a British coin into the beer of an unsuspecting drunk colonist in a tavern. Legend has it that once the ale was consumed, the remaining coin would signify that the owner of the stein would be  incriminated by default,  to the loyalty of the King. He would then be immediately drafted into the Naval Army of the  King. Consequently, the need for a glass bottom to the stein was adopted as a precaution for colonists to be able to see the naval officers by simply lifting  up the stein and prevent capture..&lt;/p&gt;
