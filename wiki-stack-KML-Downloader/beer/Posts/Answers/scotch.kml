					&lt;p&gt;I'll start by saying that what I'm suggesting isn't technically a scotch recommendation, but it is a good tip for whisky, rye, and similar spirits.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One of the more underrated genres of whiskey is "Bottled in Bond" type whiskey, bourbon, and rye. I've found that many of these spirits provide excellent value for the money.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Old Forester &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Heaven Hill&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Very Old Barton&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Rittenhouse Rye&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can read more about what Bottled in Bond means, and its history, at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottled_in_bond" rel="nofollow" title="Wikipedia&amp;#39;s Bottled in Bond Page"&gt;Wikipedia's Bottled In Bond page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I drink my Scotch neat -- too peaty/smokey and I gotta use an ice cube. Johnnie Walker Black is my go-to (~$74/1.75L at Costco in WA state).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Picked up some Kirkland Signature 16-year Highland Single Malt Scotch Whisky this evening (~$62/750mL in WA state) and it is very nice. :)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Balvenie Doublewood is probably my favorite, but it ain't cheap -- and they don't have it at Costco. :P&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It depends if you like the smokier/peatier whiskies such as Talisker, or prefer the smoother whiskies. I find the former generally overpriced but that's me. A good example of the latter is Auchentoshan 12 year old. Easy drinking (is that a bad thing?),  with no overpowering flavour but flavoursome all around and smooth bite (an oxymoron?)  at the end. I saw this for $65 on a Canadian website so I believe it fits into your Aberlour category. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Glenmorangie is a 10-year highland single-malt scotch that outperforms its price point (currently $36 at Total Wine), in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Balvenie Doublewood is CHEAP and harsh, unless you get the 17 year but still harsh. If you want a REAL Single Malt Scotch that is not many 100's or 1000's of dollars try the Balvenie 21 Year Portwood.  It is NOT harsh, it is 96 proof, smoothest stuff I have ever had!!! It is a lot more than the Doublewood though, about $150 for 750ml but if you can at least try it once!!!  I wanna try the 25 year but it's too much $ even for me and I am a Single Malt Scotch connoisseur! It costs around $500 I believe. Or hell go for the 40 year at $4000 per 750ml!  They even made a very limited few bottles of 50 year aged but they cost around $63,000 per 750ml!    &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;We need to work up a few definitions before we get to the final answer here.  So without further ado:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single Malt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Single Malt means that the whiskey has been made using ONLY malted barley and nothing else and has been distilled at a single distillery.  This is to distinguish it from:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grain/Single Pot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Grain Whiskey, called Single Pot or Pure Pot when it's Irish, is still whiskey from a single distillery but can have other grains in it, such as rye or unmalted barley.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single Malt + Single Malt = Blended/Vatted Malt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;By mixing single malts from different distilleries you get a Blended Malt or Vatted Malt whiskey.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single Malt + Grain Whiskey = Blended Whiskey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When you mix Single Malt with anything besides more Single Malt you get regular old Blended whiskey.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A lot of these terms only really apply to whiskies produced outside of the US, namely Scotland and Ireland, but Japan's whiskey-producing traditions are based primarily on Scotland's.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the US the whole malt thing goes out the window since the legal requirements only specify "Majority" grains, IE American Malt Whiskey only needs to be 51% malted barley.  Rye Malt is 51% malted rye, etc.  But the US terms also put a lot of other restrictions on the length of time the whiskey was aged and the alcohol proof at after distillation, when put into barrels, and when bottled.  But that's a different question.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From what I can find I'm not sure I can give an exact answer to the main question (when J&amp;amp;B started using screw caps) but I think I found something that matches your description, from 1972:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.maxliquor.com/product-p/j-and-b-scotch-1972-quart.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.maxliquor.com/product-p/j-and-b-scotch-1972-quart.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/czc3o.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/czc3o.jpg" alt="J&amp;amp;B Scotch Bottle, 1972"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell the label matches the picture on the page you linked and appears to have a screw-cap.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, on the website you linked to, there are example bottles from &lt;a href="https://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/j-and-b/j-and-b-rare-75cl-1960s-whisky/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;the 60's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/j-and-b/j-and-b-1970s-whisky/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;the 70's&lt;/a&gt;.  Interestingly though, the 70's bottle has a different label than the one above from 1972.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Given all of this, I would assume the switch to screw caps happened in the late 60's or early 70's and that the bottle your friend obtained is likely from the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, I am answering &lt;em&gt;assuming&lt;/em&gt; you want to stick with single malts rather than go blended. Also because people live in different parts of the world, prices may vary.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would recommend Glenfiddich 12-y as a standard go to single malt and usually a bit cheaper than the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Other good brands include Dalwhinnie and Dalmore(this one being my personal favorite) but these prices will range around the same as your Aberlour.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I've once thought about getting cheaper single malts but I have never tasted a good cheap single malt. Were they decent? A few, most were not the greatest and I would not buy again. This has been my personal experience.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Are you looking for a single malt? Those may be a little more expensive. A blend like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Famous_Grouse" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Famous Grouse&lt;/a&gt; will include good scotches from the region including Glenturret. If you are looking for something a bit smokier, I am a fan of &lt;a href="http://thewhiskeyjug.com/scotch-whiskey/talisker-storm-review/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Talisker Storm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The problem you have is implied in the question: 'affordable' and 'good' Scotch don't really go hand in hand, depending on what you mean by affordable. It's not a matter of brands, it's a matter of the average entry-point for a quality product, which is surprisingly consistent. If a distillery produces a good whisky, they are going to price it according to it's quality.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In Canada, you can typically expect any bottle that costs over about 65 CDN to be what I'd call a good, drinkable Scotch. A good metric to go by is the price of a Glenmorangie Original, or Aberlour 12. These are two starter Scotches, and most bottles at or above their price point will be what I'd call a decent whisky.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Once you get under the prices of those two bottles you'll start seeing a hit in quality, and if you get significantly lower, like 30-40 you're talking an entire tier down.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said &lt;strong&gt;one recommendation&lt;/strong&gt; to look into is 'McClelland's'. It's most certainly not a premium Scotch, but it does perform well above it's price point.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another recommendation&lt;/strong&gt; I'd make is if entry-level and above Scotches are too expensive for you then check out some bourbon and Irish whiskies. Black Bush, Writer's Tears, and Bulleit Bourbon or Rye are quite drinkable whiskies for a much better price.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;FWIW, I'd also hazard against the Glenfiddich 12 recommendation above, it is affordable but is a notoriously weak Scotch.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here are few cocktails that I can recommend and don't require much ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;1) Black Russian - Vodka and coffee liqueur &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;2) Screwdriver - Vodka and orange juice &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;3) Greyhound - Vodka and grape juice &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;4) Vodka Martini - My favorite &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for affordable single-malts, I can recommend: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Deanston, Cardhu 12, Glenfarclas Heritage and some of the Glenfiddich's whiskeys.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another great Whiskey that I can recommend is "Jameson Black barrel".
					This is an Irish whiskey but it tastes different from most traditional Irish whiskeys. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'd say yes, but with the caveat that I've only tried a limited number of Irish whiskies (mostly big name brands) and so they might be a bit more varied than I'm aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm largely ignorant of what goes into the distilling process of both Irish whisky and Scotch, but what I notice as a taster is that Irish whisky is often very sweet, with more like a sugary or fruity taste to it. I'd normally recommend them to people with a sweet-tooth.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Scotch can be very sweet too, but I find the Sherry versions often with more of a butterscotch/caramel flavour, and if they're well produced the sweetness is usually a bit more balanced than in the Irish whiskies I've tried.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If one was a connoisseur I'd imagine they'd be able to differentiate an Irish from a Scottish whisky a majority, but probably not 100%, of the time. But if someone was a beginner they'd most definitely have trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So to answer your question more directly, if you were to showcase whisky, I would argue that you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do so with product coming out of Ireland, but that it would probably be more on par quality wise with American whisky, than it would Scottish.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Right now I can think about some characteristics of a Sotch, that depend &lt;em&gt;partly&lt;/em&gt; on the age:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flavours:&lt;/strong&gt; The longer a whisky matures in a cask, the stronger is the influence of the cask on the flavours. So the character of a very young whisky largely comes from the distillery. That often means some fresh, fruity flavours, with a significant alcoholic taste. The character of an older whisky is largely defined by the cask(s). That often means some sort of wooden and softer flavours, besides other flavours that depend on the concrete cask.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Color&lt;/strong&gt;: Assuming the same cask, an 18 years old whisky is always darker than a 12 years old one, because the former had more time to absorb the color from the cask. (Ignoring the fact that many distilleries add caramel colouring before the whisky is bottled)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol and volume:&lt;/strong&gt; Over the years, the whisky constantly evaporates through the cask. Therefore, the amount of whisky in the cask is constantly decreasing (that's one reason why old whisky tends to be more expensive than young whisky). As alcohol evaporates easier than water, the alcohol concentration is decreasing as well.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm sure that a distillery doesn't use the same distillate for all products. But I have no idea if that means, that the distillate that is designated for an 18 years old whisky is crafted with more care than the one that's designated for a 12 years old whisky. Only differently, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Much of it has to do with the material they used to dry the grain. If the distillery traditionally used peat (because it worked well, was widely available, and cheap, the smell made its way into the spirits (this is why the Islay area has such a concentration of “peaty” whiskies. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Much of the flavor and color comes from how the distillery ages the whisky. One of the casks of choice these days is American white oak. Bourbon distillers in the US are only allowed to use a cask once. Scotland distilleries will buy the used casks and reuse them several more times. The best whiskies tend to be aged 12 or more years in ex-bourbon casks (first run of whisky). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As an avid whisky fan, and having worked in a distillery and visited all the Scottish distilleries but one, I can tell you this:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's incredibly easy - pretty much all the distilleries have 18 year old single malts. It's not rare at all, in fact I don't think I'd class them as "premium" in that way. For many of the whiskies I like I'll buy the 12, 15 and 18 year old. Amusingly enough, many of these whiskies are also available in supermarkets and even local shops. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a few I'll hunt down that are considerably older, but they really do command a premium. These are the kind that usually go to collectors, or are available through specialist groups, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.smws.com/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Scotch Malt Whisky Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If your question is because you plan on a whisky tour and you want to know if you can find these whiskies in the distilleries, then yes - no problem. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not a very fair question.  Not all scotches are equal in flavor profile so comparing Lagavulin to glenlivet at any price is meaningless! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, taste is personal.  I cannot convince some folks that Lagavulin is worth drinking but to me it is man's greatest creation!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said I was very disappointed in balvenie tun 1509 (don't recall the batch).  For the price it was very 1-dimensional.  At a similar price point I'd say Highland Park 30 yr was exquisite.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;On the affordable end Auchentoshan 12 was so bad I poured some down the sink.  But again, that is a matter of personal taste.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;An example of cost, age, and quality correlating is Glenlivet 12 --&gt; 18 yr.  The taste is almost identical but the 18yr is much smoother and a little more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;An example of NO correlation at all is Glenfiddich 12 --&gt; 15 --&gt; 18.  The reason they do not correlate is that the flavors are unrelated.  12yr is fruity (apples, pears, etc), 15 is like honey mead, 18 tastes like smoked oak.  I love the 18yr at ~90$ USD, compared to the 12 at 40$ USD but I would not say the 12 yr is "worse".  They don't compare.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The answer really depends on what you're looking for in the drink.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;1) The hotter the whiskey the more rapid the alcohol evaporates out and more of the bitter-notes shine through. Adding ice is cold + water which can also mask some of the whiskey characteristics while taking away some of the "harsh" fore taste of the whiskey.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;*Whiskey stones could be a good alternative if you want cooler whiskey without the effects of the water.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;2) The Perrier Water is going to add some fizz + bring the whiskey toward the temperature of the Perrier. The cooler the Perrier, the more the temperature drop on the finished product will be. Conversly, the hotter the Perrier is served, the more rapid the loss of CO2 will be. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;*Freezing the Perrier (or being cold enough to almost freeze) can be dangerous because the H2O (32ºF/0ºC) freeze before the CO2 (-109.3ºF/-78.5ºC) causing a lot of pressure and potentially an pressurized explosion to occur.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;3) The ideal ratio of Perrier+Whiskey is going to solely depend on the imbiber's taste. The more Perrier, the more fizz and more "watered down" the final drink. The less Perrier, the less fizz and more whiskey you will taste.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;*Watered down is not being used in a negative connotation here. It is being used as a catch all to describe all of the ways water (carbonated or not) affect whiskey and other liquors. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The real answer is... Experiment! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Try:&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Johnny Walker, neat, at room temp.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Johnny walker, neat, chilled&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Perrier at room temp.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Perrier chilled&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Then measure out ratios based on what your perceptions were.
					If you liked the Johnny Walker closer to room temp, both should be closer to room temp. Adding measured volumes of each until you achieve your perfect ratio. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;*An important note: The reason you don't add ice on top of the Perrier is because of the dilution when the ice melts. Therefore you could add whiskey-stones that chill without the dilution. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you like Aberlour you will probably enjoy other Speysides, some well know brands are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Glenfiddich&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Glenmorangie&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Glenfarclas&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The Balvenie&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Dalwhinnie&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The Glenlivet&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Glen Moray&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;They vary in price and each brand has different years which will obviusly effect the price. Of the above the Glenlivet Founders Reserve and Glen Maray Classic tend to be on the cheaper end of the scale.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can also pick up some really great whisky that isn't from a well known brand, for example here in the UK we have a discount chain Lidl which does a really great Speyside that is really cheap: &lt;a href="https://whiskeybon.com/scotch/lidl-ben-bracken-speyside-review/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Lidl Ben Bracken Speyside Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think there are two ways to look at this. &lt;a href="https://www.whisky-news.com/En/reports/Labels.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Some distilleries do put the date&lt;/a&gt; when they bottled the whisky/scotch it will just take some leg work. Even cheap Old Turkey has a bottled date &lt;a href="https://whiskeyid.com/how-to-date-id-your-whiskey/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;stamped on the label&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Then the other way is to do some reverse math. There is such a thing as vintage whisky. Distilled and put into barrels in say 1990 and aged 25 years. So it would be bottled in the year 2015. Obviously you might have to wait until they bottle it the year someone is born. You can see some of this at the G&lt;a href="https://www.glenfiddich.com/us/collection/product-collection/rare-and-vintage/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;lenfiddich website&lt;/a&gt; (unfortunately they have an "are you old enough question" to get past). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The last option is to just buy a bottle of 20 year old whisky the year someone turns 20 (or whatever year you want) and just give it to them then when it's released by the distillery. Holding on to a bottle for 20 years or so can leave it vulnerable to all types of accidents. Don't risk it and just buy the bottle when they turn 21 or whatever age you want to bestow it upon them.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Just to extend farmersteves answer...There are quite a few that produce limited releases annually.  These tend to be limited releases produced either by a new brand or established distilleries but they are usually limited to smaller cask numbers.  As they are limited I would expect you to have to pay a bit more, many sell out quickly from shops so you may have to use an Online Auction.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The following auction is highly regarded and this search (simply for the year 2018) will contain many of this years release.  Note in these cases 2018 is the year it was bottled, the age determined by when the cask was put down.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.whiskyauctioneer.com/auction-search?terms=2018&amp;amp;dsp=Previous&amp;amp;show_page=20&amp;amp;sort_by=d_DESC&amp;amp;op=SEARCH&amp;amp;form_build_id=&amp;amp;form_id=auction_form" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="Whisky Auctioneer 2018 search"&gt;Whisky Auctioneer search for 2018 whiskies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Just yesterday MacAllan released one limited to a few hundred but very difficult to get and managed very poorly by them if I say so myself...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finally. I am also aware some distilleries let you buy casks to bottle at a later date, or alternatively buy a bottle from a yet to be bottled cask.  If you do it this year you could request the bottling at a specific milestone for your child (I know people who have done this).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I just looked at several of my bottles, and the only one having a date on the bottle was Ardbeg and it was stamped on the bottle not on the label.  You should look at smaller distilleries as they would use it as a marketing gimmick.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;An alternative would be to buy a bottle of Laphroaig which allows you to register a square foot plot of land at the distillery and get a certificate for it, which includes the date of registration.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you expand your horizons, many bourbon distilleries in the US either batch or date their bottles by hand.  Bean-ball Bourbon from Cooperstown does, others such as Hillrock give a batch number, and Hudson Valley also does batch numbers by hand.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've seen several scotches that are labeled "From the harvest of..." a particular year, if you want the birth year to correspond to the production year.  I got my kids vintage ports since they 1) age well nearly indefinitely if properly stored, and 2) everybody can tolerate a little glass of port even if they don't like alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bourbon and scotch are types of whiskey and cognac is a variety of brandy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Bourbon is a type of whiskey, whereas not all whiskies are bourbons! The main difference between scotch and whisky is geographic: they are made in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bourbon is a type of whiskey, whereas not all whiskies are bourbons!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.diffen.com/difference/Bourbon_vs_Whiskey" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Bourbon&lt;/a&gt; is a type of whiskey that gets its name from Bourbon County, Kentucky, where it originated. Bourbon tends to be amber-colored, and a little sweeter and heavier in texture than other whiskeys.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Scotch?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The main difference between &lt;a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/30278/what%E2%80%99s-difference-between-scotch-whiskey-and-bourbon" rel="noreferrer"&gt;scotch&lt;/a&gt; and whisky is geographic, but also ingredients and spellings. Scotch is whisky made in Scotland, while bourbon is whiskey made in the U.S.A, generally Kentucky. Scotch is made mostly from malted barley, while bourbon is distilled from corn. If you’re in England and ask for a whisky, you’ll get Scotch. But in Ireland, you’ll get Irish whiskey (yep, they spell it differently for a little colour).&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are whiskeys?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Whisky or whiskey is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash. Various grains (which may be malted) are used for different varieties, including barley, corn (maize), rye, and wheat. Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks, generally made of charred white oak. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Whisky is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types. The typical unifying characteristics of the different classes and types are the fermentation of grains, distillation, and aging in wooden barrels. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Whisky (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brandies&lt;/strong&gt; are not whiskeys, but is a spirit produced by distilling &lt;strong&gt;wine&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Brandy is a spirit produced by distilling wine. Brandy generally contains 35–60% alcohol by volume (70–120 US proof) and is typically drunk as an after-dinner digestif. Some brandies are aged in wooden casks, others are coloured with caramel colouring to imitate the effect of aging, and some are produced using a combination of both aging and colouring. Varieties of wine brandy can be found across the winemaking world. Among the most renowned are Cognac and Armagnac from southwestern France. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandy" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Brandy (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Cognac?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Cognac is a variety of brandy named after the town of Cognac, France. It is produced in the surrounding wine-growing region in the departments of Charente and Charente-Maritime. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Cognac production falls under French Appellation d'origine contrôlée designation, with production methods and naming required to meet certain legal requirements. Among the specified grapes Ugni blanc, known locally as Saint-Emilion, is most widely used.&lt;a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/30278/what%E2%80%99s-difference-between-scotch-whiskey-and-bourbon" rel="noreferrer"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; The brandy must be twice distilled in copper pot stills and aged at least two years in French oak barrels from Limousin or Tronçais. Cognac matures in the same way as whiskies and wine barrel age, and most cognacs spend considerably longer "on the wood" than the minimum legal requirement. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The white wine used in making cognac is very dry, acidic and thin. Though it has been characterized as "virtually undrinkable",&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandy" rel="noreferrer"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; it is excellent for distillation and aging. It may be made only from a strict list of grape varieties. In order for it to be considered a true cru, the wine must be at least 90% Ugni blanc (known in Italy as Trebbiano), Folle blanche and Colombard, while up to 10% of the grapes used can be Folignan, Jurançon blanc, Meslier St-François (also called Blanc Ramé), Sélect, Montils or Sémillon.&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armagnac_(brandy)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; Cognacs which are not to carry the name of a cru are freer in the allowed grape varieties, needing at least 90% Colombard, Folle blanche, Jurançon blanc, Meslier Saint-François, Montils, Sémillon, or Ugni blanc, and up to 10% Folignan or Sélect. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognac" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Cognac (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Armagnac brandy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Armagnac is a distinctive kind of brandy produced in the Armagnac region in Gascony, southwest France. It is distilled from wine usually made from a blend of grapes including Baco 22A, Colombard, Folle blanche and Ugni blanc, traditionally using column stills rather than the pot stills used in the production of cognac. The resulting spirit is then aged in oak barrels before release. Production is overseen by the Institut national de l'origine et de la qualité (INAO) and the Bureau National Interprofessionel de l'Armagnac (BNIA). - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armagnac_(brandy)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Armagnac (brandy)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One last note. There also exists a liquor that is generally known as &lt;strong&gt;fruit brandy&lt;/strong&gt; and is quite popular in various regions around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_brandy" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Fruit brandy&lt;/a&gt; or fruit spirit&lt;a href="https://www.diffen.com/difference/Bourbon_vs_Whiskey" rel="noreferrer"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; is a distilled beverage produced from mash, juice, wine or residues of culinary fruits. The term covers a broad class of spirits produced across the world, and typically excludes beverages made from grapes, which are referred to as plain brandy (when made from distillation from wine) or pomace brandy (when made directly from grape pomace). Apples, pears, apricots, plums and cherries are the most commonly used fruits. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;According to a legal definition in the United States, a "fruit brandy" is distilled "solely from the fermented juice or mash of whole, sound, ripe fruit, or from standard grape, citrus, or other fruit wine, with or without the addition of not more than 20 percent by weight of the pomace of such juice or wine, or 30 percent by volume of the lees of such wine, or both."&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;In the European Union, fruit brandies may not be labeled as "fruit brandy"; instead, the legal English denomination is fruit spirit, which is "produced exclusively by the alcoholic fermentation and distillation of fleshy fruit or must of such fruit, berries or vegetables, with or without stones".&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandy" rel="noreferrer"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; A great number of European fruit brandies have a protected designation of origin, and are labeled with their respective protected names instead of "fruit spirit" ("apricot spirit", etc.). Cider spirit and perry spirit (fruit brandy distilled from cider or perry) form a separate legal category. Some fruit spirits may be labeled with alternative names such as kirsch (cherry spirit) or slivovitz (plum spirit) regardless their country of origin.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;In British usage, "fruit brandy" may also refer to liqueurs obtained by maceration of whole fruits, juice or flavoring in a distilled beverage, and such liqueurs are legally labeled as "cherry brandy", "apricot brandy" etc. all across the European Union.&lt;a href="https://www.diffen.com/difference/Bourbon_vs_Whiskey" rel="noreferrer"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; Such beverages are used similar to cordials, and as an ingredient in cocktails and cakes. Fruit brandies obtained by distillation are often referred by the French term eau de vie.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Fruit brandy usually contains 40% to 45% ABV (80 to 90 US proof). It is often colourless. Fruit brandy is customarily drunk chilled or over ice, but is occasionally mixed. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The answer above nails the quantitative parts of the question, but I'll spend a little time adding a qualitative answer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In terms of flavour and the experience while drinking, Brandy and Whisky are quite similar. If you gave a taste test to a beginner they could easily mistake one for the other.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;At the same time, though, someone who was well versed in both liquors could likely distinguish between the two a majority of the time. While there are whiskies out there which border on cloying, brandy usually tends to be sweeter than most whiskies.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, the flavour profiles for whisky are also much broader. That is, you're likely to see much more variation in the qualitative aspects of whisky than you are brandy.&lt;/p&gt;
