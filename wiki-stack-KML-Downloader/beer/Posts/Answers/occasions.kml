					&lt;p&gt;Christmas beer are seasonal beers brewed for consumption during Christmas period. These beers  often (but not always) contain more alcohol than the brewery's other types of beer and may also contain spicing. It is usually quite dark, but not as dark as a stout, with a big malt presence.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A Christmas Ale seems to be another term for a "&lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style21.php#1b"&gt;Winter Warmer&lt;/a&gt;" beer -- a dark, malty beer (raisins, dark fruit) meant to be enjoyed in colder months, with a warming effect, either from the actual alcohol, or spices it was brewed with (think nutmeg, clove, that sort of thing).  To my mind, its kindred to a barley wine, just spiced up.  This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a warm summer day, sitting on the porch, type of beer, as you may have guessed.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So a Christmas Ale is a sub-classification of beers in general.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Bock style beers are regularly produced for festivals such as Christmas and Lent.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The specific kind of bock for Lent is Lentenbock.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The only one I've tried in the UK is Oates Lenten Bock.  It was a traditional Bock style, dark, sweet and strong and it was OK.  I wasn't enamoured of it enough to repeat tasting it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Found this little tidbit the other day: &lt;a href="http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2013/02/the-ten-most-wonderful-and-strange-foods-for-lent" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ten Weird Wonderful foods for Lent&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Rauchbier, or “smoke beer,” is made using malts that have been dried over fire—-thus gaining the smoky taste of cured meats like ham and bacon. At one time all beers malts were produced over fire, but in medieval Bavaria beers of this type came to be associated with Lent when the rich, smoky tones of meat were dearly missed. There is, of course, an official blessing for beer (“Bless, O Lord, this creature beer . . . ”) which one may safely assume is more efficacious in the original Latin: ” Benedic, Domine, creaturam istam cerevisiae, quam ex adipe frumenti producere dignatus es: ut sit remedium salutare humano generi, et praesta per invocationem nominis tui sancti; ut, quicumque ex ea biberint, sanitatem corpus et animae tutelam percipiant. Per Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen.  ” &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There was a brewer that went on a beer only diet several years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/02/25/my-take-what-i-learned-from-my-46-day-beer-only-fast/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Here is the CNN article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It was an interesting read and provides some backstory on why heavier beers are sometimes associated with Lent.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Of course there are! 'associated with' allows for a great deal of latitude. In fact, just in beer itself, there are several beers that are associated with, but not directly a result of, religious customs.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Lenten beers are an entire category in and of themselves, but since you don't really want to  hear about the giant selection of Bocks and their variety of flavors and the rich history therein, we'll skip those for now.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://oldliquorsmagazine.com/whisky-water-of-life/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Whisky&lt;/a&gt; as indicated here has been associated with religious rites.
					&lt;a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bos/bos589.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Mead&lt;/a&gt; has been associated with various rituals, mostly from the Scandinavian regions. Some of these rites and rituals are so ubiquitous that it's fairly common to hear people ascribe the origin of the phrase 'honeymoon' to drinking mead.
					&lt;a href="https://www.chartreuse.fr/en/histoire/the-chartreuse-distilleries/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Chartreuse&lt;/a&gt;, 'the only liquor so good they named a color after it', is brewed by Carthusian monks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These are just a few examples; some others, besides beer, wine, whisky, mead and chartreuse, include;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;ayahuasca, which isn't specifically brewed to be alcoholic, but tends to be stored and fermented&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;kefir, which is technically haram, forbidden in islam, but definitely does get fermented&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.etonline.com/news/149897_andrew_keegan_starts_his_own_religion/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;kombucha,&lt;/a&gt; if you want something fun, which typically isn't part of a traditional religion (that I know of), but read the article. It's pretty funny.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of interrelation between alcohol and religion, because yeast has been around for a long time, and so have various religions. Dig deep enough, you'll hit a religion that uses the drink.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Whisky and wakes were written about in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;James Joyce&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnegans_Wake" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Finnegans Wake&lt;/a&gt; as well as being sung about by the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubliners" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Dubliners&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately this seems to be anecdotal, as I struggle to find more modern references.
					Beer and sports (some follow it religiously). 
					Champagne and new years. &lt;/p&gt;
