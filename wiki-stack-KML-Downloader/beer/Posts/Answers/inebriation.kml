					&lt;p&gt;Absolutely, it depends on the ABV like any other alcoholic beverage. You can drink Natty-lights all night like college kids or you can get your hands on one of &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/24/worlds-strongest-beer-snake-venom_n_4157580.html#slide=2580657" rel="nofollow"&gt;these bad boys, at 67.5% abv.&lt;/a&gt; I highly doubt carbonation has anything to do with it. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally, I prefer to drink beer for the taste, not to get drunk. So I'll experiment among many different craft brews.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;---- edit ----&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Started answering before I saw your edit. I'll keep this up for education's sake.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h3&gt;EDIT to add sources (original answer below)&lt;/h3&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Mythbusters address this in episode 127 - &lt;a href="http://mythresults.com/dirty-vs-clean-car" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://mythresults.com/dirty-vs-clean-car&lt;/a&gt; - the &lt;em&gt;rate&lt;/em&gt; of consumption is what matters, not the &lt;em&gt;order&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;h3&gt;A hangover caused by beer is less severe than one caused by a mixture of beer and liquor.&lt;/h3&gt;
  
					  &lt;h2&gt;BUSTED&lt;/h2&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;To perform this test, Tory and Grant would have to eat the same food, drink their alcohol at the same time, and sleep for the same length of time in the warehouse for consistent results. Kari (who could not take part because of her pregnancy) then devised a battery of tests to measure dehydration, memory, light/sound/motion sensitivity, and coordination. Without having drunk alcohol, Tory and Grant performed well on their control test. They then performed the beer test, with Tory drinking 14 cans of beer and Grant drinking six. They both performed significantly worse than the control tests, signifying they were badly hung over. They then repeated the test with a mixture of beer and liquor, making sure to drink an equivalent amount of alcohol as in the first test. The next morning, Tory and Grant improved significantly and felt much better than in the previous test. Thus, the Build Team declared the myth busted.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;NYTimes also addressed this back in 2006 - &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/07/health/the-claim-mixing-types-of-alcohol-makes-you-sick.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/07/health/the-claim-mixing-types-of-alcohol-makes-you-sick.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"The pattern, more often, is that people will have beer and then move on to liquor at the end of the night, and so they think it's the liquor that made them sick," he continued. "But simply mixing the two really has nothing to do with it."&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In general, the ABV of wine is higher than that of beer, so if you consume a higher ABV after a lower ABV, you will feel its effects faster, but if you're still drinking at the same rate, you won't notice you've had any effect as readily as if you drank at the slower rate more generally associated with the higher ABV beverage.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The process of becoming drunk involves becoming dehydrated. So the higher the ABV, and less water you're taking on, the faster you'll feel the effects. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is why shots get you drunk very quickly: there is little to no extra water in the mix. Other ingredients can add to this affect, and as I've personally noticed, some beers can produce very different "drunk experiences" than others - just like being drunk off wine, beer, shots, or mixed drinks can produce different results.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, absolutely if you drank half a beer with twice the ABV while your friend drank 1 beer with half the ABV, you'd probably feel drunk faster than him. Assuming you're drinking at the same pace. Less water.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer contains a lot of CO2, and CO2 causes the alcohol to 'hit to the head' much faster. This is why champagne has such exhilaration (Rausch) effect. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's not a good idea to drink any high-CO2 drink after drinking wine or stronger alcohols, and even more discouraged is mixing carbonated water with vodka, for example. Many people have heavily regret such mixing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As well, it is said you should never drink lighter alcohols after stronger. You can start with beer, than after an hour/2 drink some wine, rest and drink vodka. Never opposite. But the best is to keep one genre of alcohol on one evening. At least so are saying people in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The answer is "probably" although it is hard to know with liquors how much of the difference is social or psychological.  There are some important things to keep in mind with alcohol effects and beer though:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hops are mildly sedative.  It isn't unreasonable to think that very hoppy beers may have a different effect than less hoppy beers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gruit beers (unusual but there are some on the market!) often have other psychoactive ingredients in them too.  With historical brewing becoming a bit of an industry, it may only be a matter of time before we see commercially available henbane beer too....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol absorption will be retarded by carbohydrate content in the beer.  You will absorb alcohol more slowly from a heavy beer than a light beer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbonation works the other way.  Lightly (or rarely available uncarbonated) beers will affect one more slowly than highly carbonated beers.  For most commercial beers this is not a significant factor but for home-brewed beers or specialty beers it may be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With this being said, it isn't clear that there is a single objective answer as to what beers will effect who in what way.  The purpose of this answer is to go over some factors which may impact how a given individual is affected.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This being said, I don't condone a general pursuit of drunkenness....&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have never seen anything solid backing up &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; rhyme that encourages a particular order.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When it comes to intoxication, there are two things that are definitely relevant:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The total amount of alcohol consumed&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;How fast the alcohol is absorbed&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as I am concerned, the rest is hearsay and folklore.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There may be some auxiliary "explanations", like people who mix types being more likely to drink more overall, and people drinking different types of alcohol at different rates at different stages of intoxication, but these are not chemical qualities.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/07/health/07real.html?_r=0" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Here's one NYT article backing this up&lt;/a&gt;. I'm having a hard time finding credible scientific articles about intoxication.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This seems to more myth than fact.  I am not finding anything scientific that CO2 causes faster absorption.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If that was the case you would see carbonated fitness drinks for faster absorption.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are studies that Champagne go to the head faster but it also has a lot of sugar. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The more like causality is people that mix also just plain drink more.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For me personally I like a shot (or two) of tequila first to get a buzz and then sip beer.  I am more likely to burn (most) of it off by the time I go to bed.  If you have a belly full of beer there is just a volume of liquid for the body to process and hard liquor on top is just more liquor.  You can get stupid with a few beer and then just get even way more stupid with shots as you are numb and the beer dilutes the alcohol so you don't feel the boom.  Shots early and you have more immediate and clear feedback you are over drinking. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for wine it has about the same effect on me and the alcohol difference is not that great.   I just don't like the taste of mixing them in one evening.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are studies that higher percentage drinks are absorbed faster and it make sense as the body is processing a smaller volume for the alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The two don't mix. Beer is heavy, and wine is lighter in consistency, which would make it hard on your stomach, kidneys and liver to de-toxify.
					Wine also contains sulfites, which by themselves can make you sick.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The effect of ethanol will always be the same. For that matter, two bottles of 5% beer equal one bottle of 10% wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Depending on its fermentation, it would contain different and different amounts of more complex fermentation products. Usually, a fermentation process that is very short (and thereby cheaper) would result in something that could easily cause a hangover. Wild yeast strains also tend to produce a larger variety of undesired substances. Modern distilleries have these removed during distillation allowing for faster fermentation. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In beers and wines, undesired by-products cannot be removed. Modern breweries and vineyards deal with that by using cultivated yeast strains and/or controlling the fermentation environment, resulting in products that don't give you headache.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The amount of hops in standard beers is negligible. Even if there were enough hops in beer to have any effect, hops may not have sleep-inducing effects after all. Apparently, &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-856/hops" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; indicating such effects was conducted in combination with valerian. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The reason for adding hops to beer was its inhibiting effect on gram-negative bacteria. Nowadays, it's mostly added for its 'typical' beer flavour.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I drink an average of 1.5 litres of beer daily and I get a significantly different effect from different beers. Some give me an agressive feeling and only a select few give me a clean feel. This being said I now believe that most people including you so called experts actually have little sensitivity to this and simply overlook the differences as pure nerdiness or what ever. I do assure you however that after drinking 100s of beers and of different brands only a select few are acceptable. Do you you even have a remote clue what these ones are because I assure you I will not tell you but only that extremely few are from North America or Mexico.  &lt;/p&gt;
