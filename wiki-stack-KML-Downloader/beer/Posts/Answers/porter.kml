					&lt;p&gt;There are a few theories out there, and their veracity, like that of most historical "facts", is hotly debated.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One theory begins in 1722 when Ralph Harwood, a London brewer, created a beer called &lt;em&gt;Entire&lt;/em&gt;.  For some time, working folk had been drinking a blend of beer, ale, and strong beer, which pubs would mix to balance out their stocks and maintain acceptable flavor.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entire&lt;/em&gt; was a pre-mixed version, brewed by Hardwood then sold and delivered to pubs.  Prior to this point, each pub had mixed their own.  In addition to economies of scale, Harwood's method allowed for aging of the finished product.  Historians theorize that the name &lt;em&gt;porter&lt;/em&gt; came about because of the porters who worked at the markets and delivered the final product to the pubs.  A variation of this theory suggests that &lt;em&gt;porter&lt;/em&gt; simply refers to the working class occupations of those who drank the concoction.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another theory suggests that &lt;em&gt;porter&lt;/em&gt; comes from the Netherlands, where a beer called &lt;em&gt;poorter&lt;/em&gt; was being made as early as the 1300s.  The Dutch were prolific traders, and cultural transfer could easily have occurred.  The term &lt;em&gt;poorter&lt;/em&gt; originally concerned inhabitants of walled cities and may also have been related to social station.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer Connoisseur Online answers this pretty thoroughly in &lt;a href="https://beerconnoisseur.com/articles/difference-between-porter-and-stout"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The TLDR: is that "...originally a stout was a strong version of a porter.  Today, the difference is whatever you want it to be."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For an interesting history on the term Stout and the style of beer, you can check out this &lt;a href="http://www.realbeer.com/library/authors/smith-g/stout.php"&gt;history of stout article&lt;/a&gt; provided by Eric Deloak.  Similarly you can read a &lt;a href="http://www.realbeer.com/library/authors/smith-g/porter.php"&gt;history of porter article&lt;/a&gt; written by the same author: Gregg Smith&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: Yes, but they're growing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/suSTQ.jpg" alt="Beer style sales chart"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This chart shows, for craft beer sold in 2012, the relative portion of the market each style made up, with IPA being the most popular (a relatively new occurrence).  Porters do not even show up.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2YE43.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here's another for 2011 showing porters as quite low on the list.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oMLU9.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This chart shows the year-over-year increase in sales by style.  You'll note here that, at least in 2011, porters weren't growing very fast either.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;More recent data was a little hard to come by, but it seems that the overall sales numbers are unlikely to change &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much in a couple years: IPAs, Pale ales, Ambers and Amber Lagers are probably still topping the charts.  So it's not that porters don't sell at all, but they're certainly not top earners.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Drifting into conjecture, I would say that the people interested in 'big beers' will take a stout over a porter, and those interested in a more subtle beer will go for a brown or an amber, leaving porters in a bit of a no-man's-land in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is a table of amino acid composition in beers on page 105 of &lt;a href="http://img-srv.dtcbuilder.com/engine/builder/images/2/8/6/9/3/5/file/2.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Beer: Health and Nutrition (C. W. Bamforth, 2004)&lt;/a&gt; (page 119 of the overall PDF):&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6qkdf.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Other than that, I cannot find any nutritional breakdowns that include vitamins for stouts (and porters, in general). However, as far as micronutrients are concerned, there may not be as great a difference between stouts and other ales as one might think, since, despite the &lt;em&gt;perceptibly&lt;/em&gt; large differences in color and taste, the ingredients and processes in brewing are largely the same. Here are some findings on beer in general:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Querying &lt;a href="http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods?max=100&amp;amp;qlookup=alcohol" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;alcohol on USDA's National Nutrient Database&lt;/a&gt; yields breakdowns for&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here's a screenshot, because the host doesn't always resolve for me for some reason:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i5jan.png" alt="Screenshot of USDA query."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm willing to bet that &lt;a href="http://www.ucc.ie/en/ifcdb/accessthedatabase/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Irish Food Composition Database&lt;/a&gt; has a similar report on Guinness, but the document must be &lt;a href="http://sites.fastspring.com/eurofir/product/eurofirebookcollection_ireland" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;purchased for 15.00â‚¬&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.eurofir.org/?page_id=257" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;EuroFIR&lt;/a&gt;. According to a table of contents viewable in &lt;a href="http://www.eurofir.org/wp-content/uploads/EuroFIR%20AISBL/e-books/EuroFIR_AISBL_ebook_Ireland_Demo.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;the demo link&lt;/a&gt;, the document should contain compositions of 57 manufactured beverages.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you can infer some properties of Guinness by knowing its ingredients and process and also knowing how these ingredients and processes affect micronutrient levels.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2050-0416.1946.tb01573.x/pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, as far as major B vitamins are concerned,&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;beer contains very little thiamine (B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), of which malting the barley causes a slight loss, but otherwise stays intact through the rest of the brewing operations,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;riboflavin (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) increases during the malting and brewing processes, resulting in nutritionally significant amounts (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; seven pints supplying total daily requirements),&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;nicotinic acid (niacin, B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) fluctuates throughout the malting and brewing process, but also results in nutritionally significant amounts (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; three-and-a-half to four pints supplying total daily requirements).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FBJN%2FBJN83_04%2FS0007114500000490a.pdf&amp;amp;code=d1547300812aec1791f4e05f6aebbcf2" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; measured phylloquinone (K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) composition of beers, specifically a "bitter," a lager, and Guinness, and concluded only trace amounts in each.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Last question: no. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Porter is very malty beer originated in Britain, intended to give energy through it's high calorie content. Popular at the time of it's invention among people that carry stuff, also known as 'porters'.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Port is a red wine that is stopped in it's fermentation by addition of brandy, resulting in a drink both sweeter and stronger than wine. Long aging in barrels is required to develop nice, smooth flavors, during which time the port will be oxidized (much like sherry). A tradition associated with port, and it's aging, is to make it when a daughter is born, then serve it at her wedding.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Well, that style thing is complicated because in real world people just make beer, and don't make beer to satisfy styles guides (at least, not until very recentely when some people started to care more about style guidelines than the beer itself).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what I think is important to be aware is:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Many styles have a long and old history, often centuries, and what we have as one nowadays doesn't have much to do with what it was once ago.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Styles change a lot over time as well. I'm not a specialist, but I think before the american craft beer revolution and revival in the early 80's, no one was gathering and classifying beer styles in a guide like BJCP. And that same revival brought back to life many dead styles in different fashion (well, look the case of IPAs), by the way.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Generally, despite style guides, people have their own understanding of what is X or Y, and when naming their beers, they will do it based on their perception and references too, not strictly style guidelines.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;If you look closer, porter and stout are ancient reference styles for more specific and contemporaneous styles (sweet stout, dry stout, outmeal stout, brown porter, robust porter, russian imperial stout, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, I think it makes more sense telling the difference between a milk and an outmeal stout, or brown and baltic porter than stout X porter.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For what's worth, for me, there's no difference between stout and porter. What I mean is, at least not so that we, as consumers, can trust and be 100% of what you are going to get if you choose one over the other, specially when the name is generic like that.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What I think is enlightening is to understand the history of those related styles and how they came to be what they are today.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;BJCP style guides aside, I generally love porters and don't care for stouts. The latter (in my experience) tend to have a much more pronounced roasted malt character.  (I do like most milk stouts though, now that that's a thing)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a number of different types of porters and stouts, so it isn't necessarily a simple answer, but I would say the use of roasted grains in stouts, particularly roasted barley, is the biggest difference.  As such, you end up with more burnt toast and coffee type flavors in a stout, but the amount and type of roastiness depends upon the type of stout.  If you get the chance, try a side-by-side comparison between the regular Guinness and the Guinness Foreign Extra stouts where the regular Guinness comes off more roasty than the Foreign Extra.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most porters have little to no roastiness.  I think of them as having more smoother chocolate-type flavors, and to be lighter in color (deep red or ruby as opposed to black), but there is a lot of overlap in the Venn diagrams between the two.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Porters and Stouts were similar but different... in the beginning. I'm going to try my best to paraphrase &lt;a href="http://allaboutbeer.com/whats-the-difference-between-porter-and-stout/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this wonderful article&lt;/a&gt;, some of the BJCP Guidelines, and &lt;a href="https://beerandbrewing.com/V4VFXSgAAFm6j1c8/article/what-exactly-is-the-difference-between-stout-and-porter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Porters (have #s) Stouts (have bullet points)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;1) A substantial, malty dark ale with a complex and flavorful roasty character.  &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ul&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;A very dark, roasty, bitter, creamy ale.&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ul&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These are the BJCP definitions - note... they're fairly similar&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;2) Originally, just your "common" brown beer.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ul&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Originally, just a "stout" (or stronger) brown beer.&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ul&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Already... you can probably see why people use them interchangeably&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;3) Origin for Porters are credited to London.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ul&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Stouts are credited with originating in Ireland.&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ul&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Apparently, water (which, as odd as it seems, is the most unique thing to beers!) and science played a large part in London's success in creating &lt;em&gt;Porters&lt;/em&gt; instead of porter being a generic brown beer. Science revealed that the efficiency of the brown grains was 2/3 of pale malt. Even though brown malt was cheaper than pale, the horrible grain efficiency made it more expensive. Therefore the Porter soon had a mixed grain bill using a brown malt base and substituted pale malt for profit. This was made even more apparent when the English Governement/Parliment/forgive my idiocy on the verbage here started taxing beer.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Later- London started using a method known as "parti-gyling"... per the first link:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Parti-gyling isnâ€™t what you think it is. Almost all modern descriptions get it badly wrong. It isnâ€™tâ€”after 1800 at leastâ€”using the first runnings to make one beer and the second and third for others.  Itâ€™s much more sophisticated than that.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Porter brewers mashed several times. The worts from each mash were hopped and boiled separately, then blended to produce whatever beers were required. Two, three or even four beers were assembled from blends of each of the worts.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Itâ€™s a very efficient way of making not just huge volumes of a beer, but also relatively small amounts of stronger beers. Or any amount of any strength beer. With their brew lengths of hundreds of barrels, Londonâ€™s porter brewers couldnâ€™t brew the strongest Stouts single-gyle. The amount they could sell would barely have covered the false bottoms of their massive mash tuns.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Thatâ€™s why they often parti-gyled their stouts with porter. You can probably see where this is going. The recipes for porter and stout were, by definition, identical, as they were brewed together.
					  (Sorry I couldn't paraphrase this part... it all seemed relevant.)&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So... it seems that all Stouts are Porters; but, not all Porters are Stouts (think squares and rectangles).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as Schwarzbier goes - this is a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;LAGER&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; where Porters and Stouts are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ALES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/8/what-is-the-difference-between-an-ale-and-a-lager/18#18"&gt;I also differentiate between ales and lagers in this post.&lt;/a&gt; In the homebrewing world, there was a fad of black-lagers/ales a few years ago. The grain used in brewing was more or less burnt in order to give the pale ale a dark appearance but taste/feel like a pale ale/lager.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Dark beer is just a classification of all of these types.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/stylecenter.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Here is a link&lt;/a&gt; to the Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) that has links to what each beer type should taste/look like.&lt;/p&gt;
