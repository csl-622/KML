					&lt;p&gt;From the looks of it they sell their beers on rotation in their &lt;a href="http://bellwoodsbrewery.com/faq/" rel="nofollow"&gt;own bottle shop&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;We are just a humble micro brewery producing small batches of beer. Often times people develop a love affair with one particular beer (Roman Candle fanatics tend to be the most assertive!), but we brew over 50 styles in a year! With only 9 fermentors this ultimately means that availability works in ebbs and flows. If your favourite beer isn’t on draft or in the bottle shop, this gives you a chance to experiment with something new. We promise, there are no wrong choices.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;They are available in some restaurants and bars in Toronto (they don't have a list of which ones those are on their website), however this doesn't help you in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;They don't ship, and they don't seem to have any links to a proper distributor (from the sounds of it on their website, they sell everything they can make in house already). The relevant bit from their FAQ there:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Do you ship to other parts of Canada? The US? Jupiter?&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;At this point no. There’s no legal way to ship beer to an individual. Stay tuned for an online retail store where you’ll be able to purchase merchandise. Aliens, be damned!&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Looks like your best bet is to head back to Toronto and hit their bottle shop. That's not too far of a drive from the UK...right?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can check out the top rated beers at the user ratings site &lt;a href="https://untappd.com/beer/top_rated" rel="nofollow"&gt;Untappd&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can filter by style and country, and the app is very easy to use. I'll bring it up on my phone when I'm at a restaurant or grocery store and I want more info about a beer I haven't seen before or to check out the ratings.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think a lot depends on where you live and what is currently distributed in your local supermarkets. This reflects the local "beer culture". it is, as always, a matter of supply and demand. 
					Industrial beer is very often just &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; beer (because it is pasteurized, thus it kills all the bacteria and such that make craft beer so good and different). 
					It is very difficult for a heavily distributed (thus cheap) beer to be good enough to compete with really good, local craft beers.
					Very good beer is expensive to make, and often made in small or mid-size breweries. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In Italy in the last years we have seen a huge leap in beer culture (a "Beernaissance", if you will). We have hundreds of microbreweries, a lot of good breweries, a handful of excellent and internationally praised ones.
					People is drinking much more good beer (meaning, craft), so &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; you can find a lot of craft beer in bars, restaurants and finally supermarket. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Until few years ago, supermarkets had just industrial beer, and the occasional Leffe Blonde bottle. Now you can find a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, I think it is much better that you reverse your approach: find some non trivial beers in your local supermarkets, and query them on apps or &lt;a href="http://ratebeer.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://ratebeer.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;RateBeer is the other big rating site.  It also has a 5 point rating system but you can also just "tick" beers 1-5 stars, which may be helpful for you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There's also Untappd which is pretty popular.  It operates more on a 4square-style check-in system and has a lot of social features as well as badges for various types of beer, origins, location, timing, etc.  But their rating system is a simple 1-5 stars with an optional notes field and location tagging.  They also include a recommendation system but it doesn't take locality into account making it largely useless since the majority of the beers they'll recommend are impossible to find in your area.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a few smaller ones kicking around as well.  A buddy of mine did &lt;a href="http://littlebeerbook.com"&gt;littlebeerbook.com&lt;/a&gt;, which is fairly up your alley based on the description.  However it's pretty rough on mobile, and even outside of that the User Experience isn't the best.  Work is being done, but it's slow going with day jobs and families and all that.  So if you don't mind the interface, it'll track what you want pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There actually are a lot of really high-quality beers that are extremely well-distributed. The Trappists aside from Westvleteren and the new ones from the past couple years are available all over the place as well as a lot of classics like Weihenstephaner or Schneider. You would be surprised at just how well you can do simply trying out anything you haven't seen a commercial for.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You also need to keep in mind personal taste. The BeerAdvocate list is NOTORIOUSLY skewed towards IPAs, Stouts, Sours, Seasonals, Limited Releases and overall big beer. If you find yourself mostly enjoying things outside those categories then their list is certainly not for you. Furthermore there is certainly some inflation to a lot of the ratings, if there is a beer fewer people can get then there are fewer ratings and the law of averages loses some influence. Plus there's the beer hipster effect where people feel safer about having strong opinions on beers nobody else has had.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My advice would be to simply get a couple of friends, buy a bunch of 6-packs and share the beer and try different styles from whatever is available locally. Figure out what style your favorite beers are and then go into some research about the best beers of that style and see what you can do from there. Even if you do find a top 100 beers available in the exact town you live in it won't be catered to your tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer Citizen allows you to rate Appearance, scent, taste and mouthfeel. You can look at individual reviews or get an average rating from everyone who has reviewed the beer. Each beer has brew facts and show you similar beers to the one you are reviewing. 
					Great app&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href="https://untappd.com/home" rel="nofollow"&gt;Untappd&lt;/a&gt;, which is a social network for beer drinkers (web and app). Quite straightforward, actually. You check you beer in, rate it and leave a short comment (like Twitter). And you see a timeline with your check-ins and your friend's ones.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The rate is what you're looking for, an overall score from 0 to 5 (multiples of 0.25).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's nice for keeping a log of what you have had and see what you friends are having, too. But, it's very simple when it comes to features, don't expect much of it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is no &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt; for any bottle of wine. You can open it and it has gone bad.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Good is subjective.  Well flavored is subjective.  Flavor is more about the grape.  If you don't like a Cabernet Sauvignon then you are not going to like an expensive Cabernet Sauvignon.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are numerous reviews and point systems.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A vineyard will have a reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The wine buyer at the store has the reputation of the store to protect.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Restaurants will sample the wine before putting it on the menu.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes wine snobs know the difference and they LOVE to talk about wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are not a wine connoisseur you might not know the difference between a $40 and $400.  But you would probably prefer the $40 over over the $4 of the same grape.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In a free market supply and demand establish the price and wine is a liquid (that is an economics term) commodity.  Even a small run will have a set of knowledgeable buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes they may have just slapped a price on it as a marketing ploy. Does not mean the market will bite. For sure you don't need to bite. There are many reviews available. If you want to get into higher priced wines then find  reviewers / publications you trust.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are many wines which are for sale at many thousands of pounds/dollars that no-one will ever drink, and that are not expected to have a good taste at all - they are simply priced there through scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A rare item is going to demand a higher price from an interested buyer than a commodity item.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While I may be able to tell the difference between a £10 bottle and a £200 bottle, I may in many cases prefer the £10 (and this has proved to be the case often enough that when I used to sell wines I used to sell based on what the customer liked previously, &lt;strong&gt;Not&lt;/strong&gt; some description of the nose and palate that is upwards of 50% subjective and arbitrary)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Upwards of £200 there is almost no quality/taste difference, and upwards of £1000 the customer is solely paying for exclusivity, and the opportunity to drink or offer a glass no-one else can, or just to hold it as an investment.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Are you sure it wasn't the Brahma Malzbier? I've had regular Brahma before and it taste like any other watery pale lager from MillBudCoors. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Malzbier is a beer that is dark and they add caramel and it's low alcohol and sweet.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.brahma.com.br/cervejas/malzbier" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://www.brahma.com.br/cervejas/malzbier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Manufacture: American pale lager type beer in which, after filtration, caramel and sugar syrup are added, giving the dark coloration and &lt;strong&gt;sweet&lt;/strong&gt; taste.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;How long in advance do you need to order Westvleteren?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It seems you need to place an order in at least 60 days in advance of the time of pick up at the abbey.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The abbey is located at &lt;a href="https://www.google.be/maps/place/Brouwerij+de+Sint-Sixtusabdij+van+Westvleteren/@50.8952882,2.7208762,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x47dcc3e2684acd47:0x3f51f505680e26ce!8m2!3d50.8956974!4d2.7199924" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Brouwerij de Sint-Sixtusabdij van Westvleteren, Donkerstraat 12, 8640 Vleteren, Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. But be warned: the abbey is not easy to find. When coming from Brussels, the recommended way of travel is by car, which will take an hour and a half. Traveling by bus is doable, but not recommended. You will find yourself taking connection to connection that could possibly rack up to about a nine-hour journey.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Here’s the tricky part: if you are interested in buying this special beer, it is exclusive to the abbey and is only sold at two official sale points – the abbey and the visitor’s center. In order to get your hands on some of the world’s best beer is truly a delicate process. To acquire some Westvleteren, you must call the &lt;strong&gt;‘beer phone’&lt;/strong&gt; and place a reservation 60 days ahead of time. The phone line tends to be busy with 85,000 calls coming in every hour. Once you finally get to talk to an individual at the brewery, you will give your license plate number and set up a date and time in which you can pick up your order drive-thru style.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;While these methods may seem extreme, the monks are ultimately striving to eliminate commercial and illegal resales. There should be no pubs or bars supplying Westvleteren, and if they are, that means it’s considered a ‘gray market item.’ If you really can’t wait the 60 days, the abbey also owns a café and visitor’s center called In de Vrede, just across from the brewery, where beer can be bought on the premises to drink right away. - &lt;a href="https://theculturetrip.com/europe/belgium/articles/westvleteren-belgiums-most-secretive-brewery/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Westvleteren, Belgium's Most Secretive Brewery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Customers are limited to one case per person (per license plate) per 60 days. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;beer phone&lt;/strong&gt; for the Abbey of Saint Sixtus is &lt;strong&gt;(+32) (0)70-21-00-45&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sintsixtus.be/trial/bier-reserveren/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Bierverkoop Trappist Westvleteren&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nota Bene:&lt;/strong&gt; "The Westvleteren Beer Sale page only mentions that you cannot place another order earlier than 60 days after your previous one. It does not give any information about how long in advance the first order may be made." – &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/users/4742/altbier-is-not-old-beer"&gt;Altbier is not Old Beer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To be safer than sorry, I would still place an order in 60 days prior to pick up, unless the first purchase can be verified to be obtained earlier than that!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In addition to Ken's answer, you can also visit the abbey's gift shop at their restaurant. They usually have cardboard sixpacks for sale of one of the three varieties. There is a per person limit of 1 sixpack per day, which may or may not always be perfectly adhered to. The B&amp;amp;B we stayed at last time told us to make a couple of trips to the gift store in different clothes...&lt;/p&gt;
