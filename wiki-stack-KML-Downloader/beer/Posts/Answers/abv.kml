					&lt;p&gt;Aging, from my experience, involves the heavy proteins settling to the bottom of the bottle. Filtered beer typically doesn't need to be aged because all of that is already removed. You can consider this "pre aged" like a shirt may be "pre shrunk". Best not to buy with the assumption that it will get any smaller (or improve with time).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Much of the time, aging allows the beer to mellow out a bit. I find darker beers benefit from this the  most, but it really depends on the type of beer. Lagers, stouts, porters, have to age longer than pilsners and ales, as a general rule. But whether the brewer has begun or simulated this process is unknown. I guess it's best to follow the instructions on the bottle, or look up the bottler and see if they have recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You're speaking of Utah, I assume, the only state I've been to that has laws like that. I know you can achieve lower alcohol content by using less yeast, or sugar, or both, since alcohol in beer is produced by the fermentation process of yeast turning sugar into alcohol. I would guess this is primarily how it's done, but there could be other (post-fermentation) processes of removing alcohol. (EDIT: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_beer#Brewing_process" rel="nofollow"&gt;according to Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, I'm totally wrong. Most low- or non-alcoholic beer is made by boiling off the alcohol.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In terms of taste, lighter beers (in terms of alcohol content), generally taste, well, lighter. I like many higher-alcohol beers because the alcohol seems to bring out many of the more complex flavours in the beer, making it (in my opinion) more interesting. That's not to say that all strong beers are good or all light beers are bad, as there are many other things to consider. But I don't think it's possible to get the same complexity and flavour into a light 3.2% beer as it is in a stronger beer, in my experience anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are two ways a brewery can measure the abv:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_by_volume#Beer"&gt;By wort gravity&lt;/a&gt;: by measuring the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_%28alcoholic_beverage%29#Specific_gravity"&gt;specific gravity&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wort"&gt;wort&lt;/a&gt; (the sugar solution that the yeast ferment into beer) both before and after fermentation. The difference is the amount of sugar consumed, which can be used to approximate the amount of alcohol produced. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.themadfermentationist.com/2009/07/testing-alcohol-content-of-ice.html"&gt;By distillation&lt;/a&gt;: the sample is heated, so the water and ethanol (alcohol) evaporate off and are collected in a condenser. The specific gravity of this is measured, which can then be used to calculate the percentage of alcohol, since the densities of alcohol and water are both known. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Both methods are exact and the accuracy is entirely due to the accuracy of the equipment used to measure. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The least accurate and precise is the case of (say) a microbrewer using a regular glass hydrometer to measure the OG and FG (method 1 above) - these read to 4 significant digits, with an accuracy of +/-1 SG at best. Without getting into the details, the accuracy then is about +/-5% of the final value for a regular strength beer. So for a 5% beer, that would be +/-0.25%.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With lab grade equipment, the accuracy of method 2 can be as good as 0.05%, since the specific gravities are measured with greater precision (and accuracy.) So our 5% beer would be with accuracy 0.0025%. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Like many beer terms, "session beer" is not rigorously defined.  Several groups have tried, though:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.brewersassociation.org/attachments/0000/5183/BA_2011_Beer_Style_Guidlines.pdf"&gt;Brewers Association (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; called it 4.0-5.1% ABV&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://beeradvocate.com/articles/653/"&gt;Beer Advocate&lt;/a&gt; calls it less than 5%&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://sessionbeerproject.blogspot.com/"&gt;The Session Beer Project&lt;/a&gt; calls it 4.5%.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Really, though, if you call something a session beer, most people will understand that to mean something you could easily drink several of in a session (ie, lighter and more mild than a "big" beer).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bluepoint Brewery&lt;/em&gt; of Long Island NY makes &lt;strong&gt;Old Howling Bastard&lt;/strong&gt; at 10% ABV (though I won't buy their beer anymore as they just sold to InBev a few weeks ago)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dirtwolf&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Victory Brewing Company&lt;/em&gt; of Pennsylvania at 8.7% ABV&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;At 9% ABV, you've got Double &lt;strong&gt;Simcoe&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Weyerbacher Brewing Co&lt;/em&gt; of Pennsylvania&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Out of NY, you have &lt;strong&gt;Unearthly&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Southern Tier&lt;/em&gt;, rolling in at 9.5% ABV&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;From NY, you've got &lt;strong&gt;He'Brew Bittersweet Lenny's R.I.P.A.&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Shmaltz Brewing Company&lt;/em&gt; at 10 % ABV&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dogfish Head&lt;/em&gt; makes other IPA's outside of the 60/90/120 Minutes. Give &lt;strong&gt;Robert Johnson's Hellhound On My Ale&lt;/strong&gt; a try (10% ABV).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;At 9.7% ABV, &lt;em&gt;Smuttynose&lt;/em&gt; of New Hampshire makes the &lt;strong&gt;Big A IPA&lt;/strong&gt; at 9.7% ABV&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stoudt's Double IPA&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Stoudt's brewing Co.&lt;/em&gt; of PA rolls in at 9.43 ABV&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;From Vermont, you've got &lt;strong&gt;Ephraim&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Hill Farmstead Brewery&lt;/em&gt; rolling in at 10.5% ABV. I've never seen a beer with a 100 rating on Beer Advocate before...good luck finding this one.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Out of Pennsylvania from &lt;em&gt;Allentown Brew Works&lt;/em&gt; you've got &lt;strong&gt;Hop'solutely&lt;/strong&gt; rolling in at 11.5% ABV&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bluepoint&lt;/em&gt; also makes &lt;strong&gt;No Apologies Imperial IPA&lt;/strong&gt; at 10% ABV. Again, my discretion about InBev still applies.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flying Dog&lt;/em&gt; out of Frederick Maryland makes &lt;strong&gt;Single Hop Imperial IPA&lt;/strong&gt; at 10% ABV&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brash Brewing Company&lt;/em&gt; of Taxachusetts makes &lt;em&gt;The Bollocks&lt;/em&gt; at a whopping 12% ABV&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think that list will do for now. Again, It'd be best to rephrase your question as I was not sure if you meant beer brewed in the Northeast or beer available there. I went with the former (since it should satisfy both conditions anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What you want to keep an eye out for are so called &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/140/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imperial IPA's&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; it is a category of high ABV IPA's&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Historically small beer is believed to be between 2 and 3.5% ABV, based on notes from Belgian monasteries which produced small beer from the 3rd runnings of the mash and original French Saison recipes.  Those numbers are probably accurate for brewing between the middle ages and about the 1500s.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Small beer got a little stronger a few hundred years later when it came to America.  George Washington's famous 1757 Small Beer has been estimated as a little stronger, around 4-4.5% ABV by recreations.  Another famous historic small beer recipe from 1820 has been estimated around 3.8% and included lemon peel, clove, ginger, and cream of tartar for acidity in addition to hops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Basically it runs the same gamut as session beer does today, maybe staying a bit towards the lower end of what we'd consider session.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Any beer is only as good as the brewer's skills. In London (UK) we have a brewery producing a 2.8% abv beer (Redemption brewery, beer name escapes me) which is packed with hops and of greater hop depth than many IPAs. Batches of a beer that are brewed to be low alcohol will necessarily be different to those brewed at full strength which is why I would hope (pray?) that any brewer whose product is worth drinking would make a different beer, brewed at low strength for these markets. These beers can be as flavoursome and exciting as, if not more so than, higher strength beers.
					The process to make the beer lower ABV is simply reducing the amount of sugar that can be converted into alcohol by using a lower sugar content mash either using specific lower sugar malts, using less malt, or using a yeast that will not support higher alcohol concentrations (alcohol kills yeast...!). Using less yeast won't work as the given yeast will continue to multiply to make up the shortfall. If you are not making real beer halting the fermentation early by killing the yeast with heat (or similar) will produce a lower alcohol beer but it will be sweeter as there is more unfermented sugar. Fining and serving real ale before fermentation has produced a higher strength may have a similar effect for those types of beer.
					Since alcohol dissolves flavouring compounds better than water it is much harder to brew a highly flavoured weak beer &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; this may be offset by taste complexity.
					Larger breweries will reduce alcohol levels chemically post-production by boiling off alcohol or similar. this will reduce the flavouring compounds in the beer (see GCSE fractional distillation notes or similar for details) and so make the beer taste weaker. These are produced at mass market quantities and even the full strength product is pretty awful compared with crafted or real beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;No, federal malt beverage labeling laws make it optional (though they &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; describe standards the label must meet if brewers &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; choose to add the alcohol content label.)  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;State laws, however, may require a brewer to add alcohol content to the label.  Clearly Delaware law (where Dogfish Head is based) must not.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In my experience, this is not terribly uncommon.  It is true that most beers do have alcohol content disclosed on the label, but I've run across quite a number that do not. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in learning more about it straight from the source, it's available in the Electronic Code of Federal Regulations in &lt;a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;amp;sid=d473aa9e89b3f7135e18c8da635f26aa&amp;amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title27/27cfr7_main_02.tpl"&gt;Title 27, Chapter I, Subchapter A, Part 7—LABELING AND ADVERTISING OF MALT BEVERAGES&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Primarily through the use of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_freezing"&gt;freeze distillation&lt;/a&gt;.   After the beer is brewed, using the normal process, the temperature is brought down below the freezing point of water, but above the freezing point of alcohol, so some portion of the water in the beer freezes into ice and can then be removed.  What remains has a far higher concentration of alcohol than what can be achieved via brewing alone.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some beers such as &lt;a href="https://www.samueladams.com/craft-beers/utopias"&gt;Sam Adams Utopias&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; attain quite high levels of alcohol through the use of carefully engineered strains of yeast, though nothing like the percentages in the beers you list...Only in the high 20s ABV.  Beyond that point, we haven't yet cultivated yeast that can live and continue to produce alcohol so cheating, if you will, is required. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Number 3 and number 4 in your list is actually getting its high ABV by adding pure ethanol. The brewery didn't admit this at first, but eventually they admitted to be adding ethanol to get the high ABVs. Sadly, I can't find the blog post where they admit this at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;li&gt;the minimum alcoholic strength by volume of rum shall be 37,5 %.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;the minimum alcoholic strength by volume of &lt;em&gt;whisky&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;whiskey&lt;/em&gt; shall be 40 %.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;the minimum alcoholic strength by volume of vodka shall be 37,5 %.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;with the exception of ‘&lt;em&gt;Korn&lt;/em&gt;’, the minimum alcoholic strength by volume of grain spirit shall be 35 %.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;the minimum alcoholic strength by volume of wine spirit shall be 37,5 %.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;and some more.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Mendeleev#Vodka_myth" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Vodka myth&lt;/a&gt; may be of interest for you too.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's pretty unlikely.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Given that it was a commercial wine I don't there was much live, viable yeast in the bottle. Particularly if sulfites were added, triggering additional fermentation would probably be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;On top of that, refrigerating it for the whole 24 hours means that, even if there was viable yeast uninhibited by sulfites, it's very unlikely it much fermentation could occur. It's possible you could see some fermentation due to the Crabtree effect but it wouldn't have been much.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Highly unlikely that the alcohol went up. Four reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The alcohol already in the wine is a barrier for the yeast to re-ferment.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The sulfites in the wine could inhibit refermentation if it hasn't dissipated yet. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The cold temperatures that will also inhibit fermentation. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Many commercial wines are sterile filtered so yeast counts are zero to very, very tiny. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, in 24 hours it's highly unlikely that it fermented again. Your perception of alcohol may be enhanced by the sugar that you added. High alcohol wines routinely taste "sweeter" to many people even though sugar levels are low. You might have tricked yourself into thinking sweet wine = higher alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The feeling of alcoholicity, at tasting, is very dependant of many factors, such as temperature of beverage, sugar, glycerol and a few other molecules content, and of course personal abilities of the taster as well as the  preceeding tastings. Concerning the present situtation, a simple experiment is a comparative tasting : keeping two glasses of the same wine, in closed glasses (sealed with plastic film to limit oxygenation/oxidation), put them aside the honeyed bottle in the fridge ; then a few minutes before tasting, get them all off the fridge, serve a glass from the bottle ("glass 1"), in "glass 2" (one from the fridge) add the same relative quantity of the same honey that was added in the bottle, and in the last fridge glass ("glass 3"), add the same relative quantity of white sugar. Again seal the three glasses in order to mix "2" and "3", and let them dissolve their addings (without forgetting to shake "glass 1" as much as the 2 others), and finally get all three be at the same temperature. Then taste, or better, have someone taste them without knowing which is what (blind tasting)… Not a complicated experiment, but sure the best way to know. My bet is "1" and "2" will be considered almost the same, and eventually a bit more alcoholic than "3".&lt;br/&gt;And my proposition for an explanation is that in honey, there are other molecular chemicals that enhance the feeling of alcohol (ethanol) (other "-ol"s and esters…?).&lt;/p&gt;
