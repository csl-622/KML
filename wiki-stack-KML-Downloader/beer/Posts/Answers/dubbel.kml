					&lt;p&gt;In short, prepare for a hangover. They pack a strong amount of alcohol (6-9% ABV), but you won't really taste it much. You're gonna get a lot of malt flavor, they're not very hoppy beers. So expect some sweet, fruity flavors. I'd recommend you give Allagash Dubbel Ale a try. It's a bit pricey (at like $12 for a 4-pack), but it's well worth it. I've never been disappointed by any beer from Allagash.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Now If you're curious, a Tripel is like a double, but they use three times the amount of malt than a standard Trappist "single", hence the name. So expect flavors similar to that of the dubbel, but much more pronounced. They are also higher in alcohol than a dubbel (9-12% ABV). For this style, my personal favorite, as of now (I've only had two of them) is Weyerbacher Brewing Co's Merry Monks Ale. The other one was the Allagash Tripel, which was also outstanding, but I'm partial to the Monks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As with any style, there's a fair deal of variation from one brewery to another.  At a high level, though, you can expect them to be darker (although not stout-dark), rich, and malty.  Expect a complex taste, with many notes and flavors.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;More specifically, the BJCP have this to say (abridged):&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aroma&lt;/strong&gt;: malty sweetness, hints of caramel or chocolate, and moderate fruity esters.  Some will have a little spice to them.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appearance&lt;/strong&gt;:  Dark amber to copper in color, Large, dense head.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taste&lt;/strong&gt;: Same as aroma. Alcohol flavor, if any, should be mild and not solvent-y.  No or minimal hop flavor.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mouthfeel&lt;/strong&gt;: Medium-full body. Medium-high carbonation.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.homebrewtalk.com/wiki/index.php/Belgian_Dubbel#Competition_Styles"&gt;See here&lt;/a&gt; for the full description.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Dubbels and Tripels are vastly different beers. While dubbels are generally something akin to a brown ale, malt forward with some light hints of dark fruit and roastiness, Tripels are pale to golden, being a vehicle for both the yeast flavors (clove/bananna), fruity esters, and the whims of the brewer (Belgian candi sugar, coriander and other spices are common additions).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The additional Trappist style ale the Quadripel (Quad) is much more like a bigger version of the dubbel, although they have their own distinct flavor profiles as well. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's often a misconception that one comes forth from the other, this is incorrect. The name was used to indicate the strength of the Westmalle beers. Originally there was the Enkel, Dubbel and Tripel. It is said that they represent the holy trinity. Later quadruppels were added. Both Dubbel and Tripel as name were first used by the Trappist brewery of Westmalle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Westmalle produced the first dark beer in 1856 named "Dubbel" (the recipe was changed in 1926). Dubbels are dark in color, and tend to have malt flavors dominating over hops. Whereas the Quadrupels have more of a fruit presence, the Dubbels tend to be a bit spicier with strong caramel flavors. They tend to have an ABV of 6.5-9.0%.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Chimay Red&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;La Trappe Dubbel&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Ommegang&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Westvleteren 8 &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Rochefort 6&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Westmalle Dubbel&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Tripels are lighter color, often blonde. They are generally a lot fruitier and lighter in flavor. The name Tripel originally was first used in 1956 by the Westmalle brewery to name their strongest beer (originally produced in 1930 and named Superbier, it was renamed to Tripel). The ABV is a lot higher than the double,  8.0-12.0%. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Tripel Karmeliet&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Westmalle Tripel&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;St. Bernardus Tripel&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Leuvense Tripel&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Chimay Cinq Cents Tripel &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A Belgian Double is an amber/brown beer of usually 6-7.5% ABV (They can drift higher).  The style was most likely originated at Westmalle in the mid 19th Century.  While Trappist abbeys tend to be the origin and driver of the style, many secular Belgian breweries produce them as Abbey beers which may have actually been a brewing monastery at one point or simply as a Dubbel.  They're not as popular amongst American brewers as triples though.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as flavor profile, it's a malty but dry beer.  The Belgian abbey yeast strains will ferment the beer fairly dry but will create a whole host of fruity esters and spicy phenols that will add to the mid range caramel malts.  Many of the Trappist versions have attenuation of 80%-90%.  Westmalle Dubbel, Chimay Red Label, New Belgium Abbey, St. Martin Brune are all good examples of the style.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With regards to AudiFanatic's answer, In this case, Beer Advocate is wrong in their description of a Triple. Triples do NOT use 3x's the malt as a Single.  No brewer will tell you that, nor is it true historically.  Malt extraction is linear, meaning 3x's the malt will be 3x's the alcohol.  The closest you get to that is historically when the single was the 3rd running (like a small beer). With this method, the 1st run had triple the fermentables extracted than the 3rd run.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And while I may only be a blogger, with 13 years of industry experience, I spoke with highly trained brewmasters and read references written by authoritative experts.  I'm pretty sure my answer article is more accurate than the Beer Advocate's, in this case.  Also, the flavor profile of a triple does not have "flavors similar" to a dubbel.  Dark malt and light malt will give very different flavors. The only Triple that has similar flavor is Stift Engelzell's triple, which is a unique dark triple, as they're labeling it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In Dutch the names mean double and triple, they originated at the Belgian Westmalle abbey brewery where the double was a strong brown ale. Their tripel was the name they gave to their strongest beer, a blonde pale ale.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These beers quickly became popular and were imitated worldwide as were their names. The convention now is as following, a dubbel is a strong (6%-8% abv) dark ale, a tripel is a strong pale ale in the style of Westmalle tripel (9.5%). A quadrupel is an ale stronger than a tripel (+10%) but beyond that there is no real agreement on what it should be. Westvleteren 12 is an example of a quadrupel.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Color tends to come primarily from the malt bill used (darker roasted malts lending darker color to a beer).  In the case of Belgian beers, a "candi" sugar (derived from beets) may used as an additive, and different styles use different types of candi sugars.  For dubbels in particular, the candi is a darker variety, made with a (more) substantial dose of molasses, which would darken the beer further.  A tripel uses a candi with less molasses.&lt;/p&gt;
