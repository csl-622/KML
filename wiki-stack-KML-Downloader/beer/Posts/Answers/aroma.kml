					&lt;p&gt;Yes.  Taste is really smell, and different glasses can capture aromas differently.  Furthermore, different aromas may be more or less present dependent upon temperature, and a glass may be crafted to be held a particular way (gathering more or less heat from your hand).  The same is true for wine glasses.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, how much of a difference it makes &lt;em&gt;to you&lt;/em&gt; is what's important.  Going back to the wine comparison, I can sometimes tell the difference between different glasses, but not consistently.  So it's not the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; important thing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Now that &lt;em&gt;that's&lt;/em&gt; said, there has been some informal, perhaps less than perfectly scientific studies, including a &lt;a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2012/06/beer-glasses-best-glass-for-craft-beer-taste-test.html"&gt;blind test&lt;/a&gt;.  Beer advocate provides some more &lt;a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/101/glassware/"&gt;detailed information&lt;/a&gt;.  Some of my local bars carry stemware for specific European beers, and I know of one stateside brewery, Black Shirt Brewing in Denver, which really wants you to &lt;a href="http://www.fermentedlychallenged.com/2012/06/black-shirt-brewing-to-feature-offero.html"&gt;stick your nose up in it&lt;/a&gt; (to good effect, in my experience).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The fact that both Humulus lupulus (hops) and Cannabis sativa (marijuana) have similar organoleptic properties (taste and smell) could indicate a common ancestry--but it isn't proof. Lots of plants make similar aroma molecules, known as terpenes and terpenoid compounds, including lemons (which make limonene), lavender (linalool) and conifers (pinene) -- but none of them are closely related to cannabis or hops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The 'dank' scent you're experiencing is the smell of Hops - among the closest botanical neighbors to the Marijuana plant and a key ingredient of beer. The two plants both look and smell nearly identical. Specifically, the dank, resiny scent you pick up from a very hoppy brew is the smell of so-called "Alpha Acids" -  which are chemically a part of the same family as THC, the active ingredient in Marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As to why some beers are, well, dank, and others aren't? It's a factor of the highly variable alpha acid content in different &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/138/does-the-climate-and-growing-conditions-of-hops-effect-the-taste-of-a-beer-like/145#145"&gt;hop varietals&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a question of &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/127/dry-hopping-versus-regular-hopping"&gt;process&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the aromatic alpha acids in hops boil off or dissolve as part of the normal fermentation process, however, some brewers 'dry hop' their beer -  adding additional hops at the end of the process, with the explicit purpose of enhancing the aromatic qualities of the beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would avoid bread, since that contains quite a bit of salt and yeast - so if you taste yeast in the next beer you don't know if it's from the beer or from bread still stuck in your teeth. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The food should be neutral, preferably unsalted and consumed with water. Unsalted crackers are probably as close to ideal here. While cheese can work, I wouldn't say it neutralizes the palate, but softens it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not have any experiense on Beer testing but here are few tips from &lt;a href="http://beer.about.com/od/howtotastebeer/ht/HowToTasteBeer.htm"&gt;beer.about.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Do not taste new beers with food or soon after eating. The lingering flavors from food can greatly affect your impression of the brew.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Cleanse your palate with water. Crackers or cheese are fine but you should remember that even these foods can affect the apparent flavors of the beer.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;If you're tasting a number of different beers, let the color be your guide. It is best to taste from light to dark.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would like to point out that taste is not the only important criterion when drinking beer. What you want is a good &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt;, and the taste is only a part (albeit a major part) of that.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Having different glasses for different types of beers can affect your drinking experience in a number of different ways. First off, having an unusual or unique glass can often be very fun, because it's probably not something you're used to. The first time I ever drank beer from a litre mug was a very fun experience for me, and not because it made the beer taste differently. Secondly, I find that different types of glasses encourage me to enjoy the beer in different ways. I find that glasses with stems, which are often used for stronger beers, encourage me to drink the beer more slowly and savor it a bit more than a glass without a stem. I think these effects on experience are one of the big reasons for the wide variations in beer glassware. As a beer manufacturer, if I could make a unique glass that will better help people remember my beer, I would consider that a worthwhile investment.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm not trying to say that the effects of glassware on taste don't exist or are unimportant; I think they are important. But they're only part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a Belgian I am always told by bartenders and brewers that for special (heavy) Belgian beers a Tulip glass is a good choice, except for Belgian Lambics (nl:Lambieken) for which one should use a flute glass. These glasses are sometimes  scratched at the bottom to better accommodate the bubbling (for example: Duvel Glasses)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown a correlation between a foods presentation and the perceived goodness of the taste.  So even excepting the usual reasons for matching a beer style to a glass style (head retention, aroma dispersal, etc.), presenting a beer in a good looking vessel will enhance its taste.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I spent many years in Germany  and other European countries drinking many different types of beer...I can tell you, for me, a Pilsner is best served in tall thin glasses, export beer in mugs, preferentially stein type and wheat beers in flute style glasses....taste, aroma and the expereince is all different with these glasses...oh and for general knowledge, fruits and other flavors only ruin beer....&lt;/p&gt;
