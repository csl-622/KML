					&lt;p&gt;I suspect this really boils down to each persons' chemistry.  IPA's don't have any real negative impact on me in terms of hangovers but Budweiser (as a prime example) has a much faster onset of hangover for me and I suffer far worse from it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The "Ice Beers" that became popular in the early 90's really caused me to have a lot of problems but, again, IPA's of all stripes typically don't bother me at all.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Although as Bill said it can be down to a persons chemistry. One reason for you finding that IPAs affect you more could be the higher hop content in a Pale Ale (IPAs in particular). Hops (the oils) can have an effect on brain chemistry, that affect can be positive or it can be negative!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some people can actually have alergic reactions to hops, or even beer in general (poor them, see &lt;a href="http://www.md-health.com/Beer-Allergy.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;). Where as I suffer from some nasty migraine problems and actually find that well hopped ales alleviate some of the symptoms (not that I use it as a reason to drink!!).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So to sum up is it possible that you find that IPAs cause you to suffer more in the morning because you have a slight intolerance to higher hopped beers. Where as your fellow drinkers do not.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is a broad question, notably regarding the differences between IPAs and Double IPAs, but here's an overview focusing on the naming (and misconceptions thereof) and brewing of variants.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h3&gt;Double IPA vs. Imperial IPA (IIPA)&lt;/h3&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, the Double IPA is also known as an Imperial IPA (IIPA). You can think of the "double" as referring to the two letter I's :-) but the name actually owes itself to the beer having "double" the strength / hops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h3&gt;IPA vs. Double IPA&lt;/h3&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Double IPA generally uses more hops (though not literally "double"), lengthier brewing processes (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; Dogfish Head's 90 Minute IPA, which is boiled for longer than its 60 Minute variant), sometimes secondary fermentation, etc. It has higher alcohol content, IPAs stopping around 7.5% ABV, while Double IPAs can soar to above 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Double IPAs are claimed to have been started by the owner of the Russian River Brewing Company, famed for its flagship brew, Pliny the Elder, a Double IPA itself.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h3&gt;American Pale Ale (APA) vs. American IPA&lt;/h3&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The APA and American IPA are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; synonymous. American Pale Ales are a derivative of (regular) British Pale Ales, deriving their own flavor from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hop_varieties#American"&gt;American hops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale. American IPAs, meanwhile, are, of course, derived from actual (British) IPAs, and possess greater bitterness and higher alcohol content—examples include Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale and Dogfish Head's 60 Minute IPA. The line between APAs and IPAs blur (as do between many variants of ales), but categorically speaking, APAs are not IPAs.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h3&gt;IPA vs. Black IPA&lt;/h3&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The black IPA (also known by American Black Ale—and yes, a subset of the American IPA) uses dark roasted malts (used in porters and stouts) to achieve the color, while preserving hops characteristics. Some consider the black IPA more of a hoppy porter instead—and don't believe the style will be formally recognized (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; by the Brewers Association).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is no correlation between boil time and ABV.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The increased ABV stems from them adding more malt to balance out the extreme bitterness for the beers with longer boil times.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, it's important to note that the boil time is not the only thing that increases with each of those beers.  Dogfish Head continually hops during the boil, and the boil extracts the alpha acids from the hops, giving the beer bitterness, so a longer boil with more hops results in a wort that is more bitter. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is where the additional alcohol comes in:  To counteract the extra bitterness, the beers that have boiled longer have both additional malt added to balance the bitterness, and are given additional fermentation and conditioning time to allow the yeast to convert all of those malt sugars into alcohol.  In 120 Minute IPA's case, it spends an entire month in fermentation, resulting in an exceptionally high level of alcohol at the end.    &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a note on the boil process and ABV.  Boiling effectively stops the process of converting starches into sugars which the yeast can turn into alcohol by destroying enzymes in the malt.  Therefore once you are boiling, this process has stopped.  Boiling affects hops, by boiling off the aroma and extracting more of the organic acids that provide bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What does affect abv is the period of time the wort is kept warm before boiling.  This time and temperature affects how much of the starches convert and therefore trades between body and abv.  Boiling fast means you have a lot of body and low alcohol.  Boiling later means you have more abv and a lot less body.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a complete novice to food pairings with beer, I've been looking at &lt;a href="http://www.craftbeer.com/attachments/0000/0533/beerandfood.pdf"&gt;this nifty pairing chart on http://www.craftbeer.com [PDF]&lt;/a&gt; whenever pairing questions have come up on Beer.SE. According to it, the suggested pairing for an IPA is&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Strong, spicy food (classic with curry!); bold, sweet desserts like carrot cake&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;and for a Double/Imperial IPA is&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Smoked beef brisket, grilled lamb; Southern chicken-fried steak.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I found a great little &lt;a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2012/03/what-to-eat-with-ipa-india-pale-ale-food-pairings.html"&gt;summary by Michael Agnew (2012)&lt;/a&gt; that explains some of the rationale behind these pairings (emphasis mine hereon):&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;When pairing IPA with food you have three basic flavor hooks at your disposal; bitterness, hop flavor (spicy, grassy, herbal, earthy, and citrus), and caramel. Hop flavors have a great affinity for spices and light fruits. Bitterness has a cooling affect. Paired with &lt;strong&gt;spicy dishes&lt;/strong&gt;, IPA will fan the flames at first, but douse them in the end. Bitterness also amplifies &lt;strong&gt;salty and umami flavors&lt;/strong&gt;. The caramel flavors in the beer will latch onto the sweeter side of a dish, tying into things like &lt;strong&gt;caramelized onion&lt;/strong&gt; or the crispy skins of roast poultry. And the hop acids and carbonation make IPAs &lt;strong&gt;great palate cleansers&lt;/strong&gt; to take on even the fattiest deep-fried delights.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Samuel Adams has a "Pair with Sam" tool, and looking at its &lt;a href="http://www.samueladams.com/food-and-craft-beer/pair-with-sam?beer-name=whitewater-ipa&amp;amp;beerid=7abae512-5798-4f59-bd3e-98698adcd1bf"&gt;suggested pairings for their Whitewater IPA&lt;/a&gt; (hoppier than their Latitude 48 IPA), &lt;strong&gt;pork appears to be the meat of choice: pulled pork, barbeque ribs, chorizo, roasted pork tenderloin, and sweet sausage&lt;/strong&gt;; and the rest of its suggestions align with the salty-and-spicy pattern we've  seen.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;We seem to have found strong consensus already, but just one more to make sure. In &lt;a href="http://bluepointbrewing.com/bpbc/food-pairings/guide-to-pairing/"&gt;Blue Point Brewing Company's words&lt;/a&gt;, its IPA pairings are meant to complement&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;intensely flavorful, highly spiced dishes, such as curry, and bold, sweet desserts like flourless chocolate cake and crème brulée&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;rich, aromatic, spicy and smoked foods such as chili, BBQ ribs, grilled chicken, and beef.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Actually, I think they stole those words from Wegmans' &lt;a href="http://www.wegmans.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?productId=667885&amp;amp;storeId=10052"&gt;Guide to Beer and Food Pairing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;DIPAs generally have a high enough ABV (7%+) to age for a few months...but you probably don't want to.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most contemporary IPAs and DIPAs are best drank within 3 weeks from the date of bottling.  Stone's "Enjoy By" Series gives you 5 weeks to drink the IPA if properly refrigerated.  Super hop-bursted IPAs with a ton of aroma like Heady Topper recommend to drink them within 2 days, claiming the flavor and aroma begins to degrade after only a few hours if unrefrigerated.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One notable exception is Dogfish Head's 120 Minute IPA which is super high ABV and can probably be considered a barleywine for the purpose of aging.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Less intense IPAs like Long Trail's Vermont IPA could probably keep up to 2 months, maybe 3 with really good refrigeration but not much beyond that without starting to taste real strange and losing a lot of their floral and herbal notes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Spicy foods. My personal favorite is stir fry. Something that isn't heavy on carbs is ideal, so with stir fry I go light on the noodles (or rice) and heavy on peppers, onions, and meat (usually chicken or beef). Again, don't use the milder sauces like teriyaki, use something with some kick.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;CHEESE! Extremely sharp cheddar is best. A sharp Vermont or New York white cheddar will do as well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I agree with the other answers: IPA's are not really intended to be aged like a barleywine. However, the style was historically brewed to survive the long journey by ship from England to India. So while they might lose some the freshness and hop volatiles over time, you can certainly keep them for many months and they will still be very drinkable. (Assuming, of course, that the brewery handled the beer properly prior to bottling).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, don't be in a rush to finish them. And never, ever throw beer out that you think may be too old without tasting it first. Beer does not spoil in the sense that it becomes harmful or dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bluepoint Brewery&lt;/em&gt; of Long Island NY makes &lt;strong&gt;Old Howling Bastard&lt;/strong&gt; at 10% ABV (though I won't buy their beer anymore as they just sold to InBev a few weeks ago)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dirtwolf&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Victory Brewing Company&lt;/em&gt; of Pennsylvania at 8.7% ABV&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;At 9% ABV, you've got Double &lt;strong&gt;Simcoe&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Weyerbacher Brewing Co&lt;/em&gt; of Pennsylvania&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Out of NY, you have &lt;strong&gt;Unearthly&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Southern Tier&lt;/em&gt;, rolling in at 9.5% ABV&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;From NY, you've got &lt;strong&gt;He'Brew Bittersweet Lenny's R.I.P.A.&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Shmaltz Brewing Company&lt;/em&gt; at 10 % ABV&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dogfish Head&lt;/em&gt; makes other IPA's outside of the 60/90/120 Minutes. Give &lt;strong&gt;Robert Johnson's Hellhound On My Ale&lt;/strong&gt; a try (10% ABV).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;At 9.7% ABV, &lt;em&gt;Smuttynose&lt;/em&gt; of New Hampshire makes the &lt;strong&gt;Big A IPA&lt;/strong&gt; at 9.7% ABV&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stoudt's Double IPA&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Stoudt's brewing Co.&lt;/em&gt; of PA rolls in at 9.43 ABV&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;From Vermont, you've got &lt;strong&gt;Ephraim&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Hill Farmstead Brewery&lt;/em&gt; rolling in at 10.5% ABV. I've never seen a beer with a 100 rating on Beer Advocate before...good luck finding this one.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Out of Pennsylvania from &lt;em&gt;Allentown Brew Works&lt;/em&gt; you've got &lt;strong&gt;Hop'solutely&lt;/strong&gt; rolling in at 11.5% ABV&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bluepoint&lt;/em&gt; also makes &lt;strong&gt;No Apologies Imperial IPA&lt;/strong&gt; at 10% ABV. Again, my discretion about InBev still applies.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flying Dog&lt;/em&gt; out of Frederick Maryland makes &lt;strong&gt;Single Hop Imperial IPA&lt;/strong&gt; at 10% ABV&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brash Brewing Company&lt;/em&gt; of Taxachusetts makes &lt;em&gt;The Bollocks&lt;/em&gt; at a whopping 12% ABV&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think that list will do for now. Again, It'd be best to rephrase your question as I was not sure if you meant beer brewed in the Northeast or beer available there. I went with the former (since it should satisfy both conditions anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What you want to keep an eye out for are so called &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/140/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imperial IPA's&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; it is a category of high ABV IPA's&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;TL DR; No.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer flavor changes over time (hops fade away, oxidation takes hold, etc.), and this process happens more quickly at warmer temperatures than colder ones. But there are no additional chemical reactions caused by temperature changes, so warming to room temperature and re-chilling multiple times is not going to have any added effects on the beer. Assuming you are drinking it within a few weeks, you won't notice the difference with bottled or canned beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think this myth took hold from left-over kegs after parties: A half-empty keg that was dispensed by pumping air into it will start to oxidize much more quickly since oxygen is being added to it. When it warms the oxidation speeds up and it tastes stale within a day or two. Keeping it cold slows that down a bit, but even cold it won't last very long. A keg being dispensed using CO2 is a different story: that will last as long as bottled beer and can be warmed and rechilled without ill effects.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In all of this, I am referring to room temperature. Beer left in a car in the sun for hours will start to stale much more quickly, even if bottles are protected from the sunlight. You won't get the skunky flavor caused by the light, but it will taste stale.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I did some experimentation at home to answer this question.  My results indicated that room temperature and temperature fluctuation had no impact on flavour.  Very high temperature (140° for 24 hours) seems to create a very slight hard to define harshness.  Check out my results here:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From their website, it looks like they only distribute around &lt;a href="http://www.newenglandbrewing.com/distributors.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;.  If you are really interested in pursuing it, acheong87's recommendation of finding someone to trade with may be your best bet.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I disagree: boil time &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; affect ABV.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Assuming you're not trapping the steam, most of what boils off is water, meaning your final wort will have a higher O.G. In general, that will result in a smaller quantity of a higher ABV beer. (Of course, there are many variables, such as your yeast, your fermentation time, your ratio of fermentable:unfermentable sugars, and so on.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, the starch-&gt;sugar conversion is generally terminated by your sparge (that being one of its purposes), so how fast you get to your boil doesn't have much of an impact.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.beeroftomorrow.com/white-ipa/"&gt;WHITE IPA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A basic definition would be:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;strong hop character - similar to ipa&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;wheat / wit grainbill-  &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;essentially a mashup (beer pun) of wit and ipa, lighter malts with strong hops&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as the is it an IPA question: as long as its fairly high alcohol, most of the ingredients would point to being almost the same as an IPA. but like noted above, there are different malts and probably a different yeast. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From the looks of it they sell their beers on rotation in their &lt;a href="http://bellwoodsbrewery.com/faq/" rel="nofollow"&gt;own bottle shop&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;We are just a humble micro brewery producing small batches of beer. Often times people develop a love affair with one particular beer (Roman Candle fanatics tend to be the most assertive!), but we brew over 50 styles in a year! With only 9 fermentors this ultimately means that availability works in ebbs and flows. If your favourite beer isn’t on draft or in the bottle shop, this gives you a chance to experiment with something new. We promise, there are no wrong choices.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;They are available in some restaurants and bars in Toronto (they don't have a list of which ones those are on their website), however this doesn't help you in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;They don't ship, and they don't seem to have any links to a proper distributor (from the sounds of it on their website, they sell everything they can make in house already). The relevant bit from their FAQ there:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Do you ship to other parts of Canada? The US? Jupiter?&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;At this point no. There’s no legal way to ship beer to an individual. Stay tuned for an online retail store where you’ll be able to purchase merchandise. Aliens, be damned!&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Looks like your best bet is to head back to Toronto and hit their bottle shop. That's not too far of a drive from the UK...right?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;YES. Deschutes Chainbreaker White IPA is in fact made with ale yeast using pilsner, malted wheat, wheat, and a large quantity of hops. A pale ale is an ale (a beer made with ale yeast) and lightly malted barley and adjuncts. An IPA is a pale ale that has been hopped greatly. Your particular white IPA is light in color and has 55 IBUs, qualifying it for the IPA class of beer. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In case you are curious:
					The reason IPAs were established is because the English brewers receiving spices from India made a habit of sending the would be empty ship back loaded with beer. At the time pale ales were the staple beer. At first the beer developed a bad flavor during the long voyage. English brewers learned to cover the negative flavor of their pale ales with more bittering hops. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;IBUs stands for International Bitterness Units, it is an approximation of how much bitterness you will taste. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've had it and I would say it's not really worth going out of your way for it. It's been overhyped, in my opinion, and while it's a good beer I don't think it's really as mind-breakingly good as many others seem to think.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I believe this discrepancy arises from the fact that Heady Topper is a relatively well balanced IPA. It has the hops bitterness to it that IPAs do, and the high alcohol content of a double, however it also has more of a malty body to it that most people are unused to when drinking IPAs. So lots of people are shocked when drinking it that it actually has some balance between the body and the aftertaste, so that's part of what leads to the high reviews (in my opinion).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So if the opportunity comes up to try it, sure, go for it. But I wouldn't really go out of my way to chase after it - there are other well balanced IPAs out there that are more readily available.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I live in Vermont and I've had quite a few cans of Heady Topper and some from cask. I really love Heady Topper and I haven't yet had another DIPA that tastes similar. First, it's not that expensive. It's $3.75 for a 16 oz can. $14 for a 4-pack. You can get it at local bars, pubs, and restaurants for $5/can. Around $78 for a case (24 x 16oz cans). Compared to other DIPA of similar quality, it's not that expensive (sure if you compared it to macro lagers...)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's produced by a small family owned brewery that's went through 2 expansions which doubled their brewery in size each time over the last 2 years (cannery has only existed for 2 years, before that they brewed it at a brewpub until the brewpub was destroyed by Hurricane Irene). They are currently getting their paperwork finalized for construction of a second brewery which will expand their production even more than before.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For locals, it's not that difficult to acquire. If you visit Vermont and plan ahead, then you're sure to leave with a case or two.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think it's worth trading for, but just remember that there's no beer that's life changing. Just a lot of really good tasting beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Being in California, I have only been able to get my hands on one can. I did enjoy it, however I found it to be very common. In California we are bombarded with IPAs of this same ilk. High alcohol, created by adding sugar to lighten the body, and huge amounts of hops. Call me old school but I prefer IPAs that have about 7 ABV. and about as much hops as the average Pale Ale these days. Lagunitas just put out a beer that is 4.75 ABV with a bunch of hops. Maybe I can have two! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think there is probably some truth to the general responses here. I too am a big IPA fan and when I first started drinking them, I had no major issues with hang overs, outside of the fact that they have a much higher gravity. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My own experience over the last year is that I've witnessed a peculiar tendency to get very clogged sinuses the morning after just a handful of IPAs (really any brand). This it to say that the reaction is due to something in the beer other than the alcohol, because less hoppy beers do not offend my sinuses as much.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the late response, but as I look on the internet for discussions concerning this topic I ran across this question.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the mid 1800's in England, IPA's were created and produced for multiple reasons. Long story short, as Europe was going through a technology renaissance period, ingredients used for brewing changed and grains that were converted into malt became lighter. Therefore, dramatically changing the "beer", that was much darker at that time, now into and ale. As this changed the palettes of many at that time they also introduced a great amount of fresh hops to these new ales to make a strongly hopped ale. The term IPA was introduced as a well known brewer(s) started shipping this new type of beer to India, giving it the distinct name IPA-India Pale Ale.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am providing this back ground to make a point. As this product was fermented, it was very typical to age and IPA Beer for a minimum of 1 year. This was done to assure that the beer was completely fermented and safe to transport on ships to India. This trip would take even more time and put the produced under various environmental stresses. This beer or "ale", was hopped very strongly and even topping the very hoppiest beer on the market in the U.S. today. Using the freshest malt as well as the freshest hops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My final point or argument is, that as I recreate the IPA and use fresh ingredients typical to a real IPA, I find that my IPA's last over a year in the bottle. As I drink them 3 to 6 and even 9 and 12 months the hoppy flavors still remain and even develop. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are many variables that allow me to get to this end result. This including yeast and malt selection, and also multiple methods that help produce beneficial fermentation, allowing the taste of the final product to be clear of flaws that would be created by the yeast during primary as well as the bottling (carbonation) period.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;After 30 years of beer making many of these truths become evident as I continually taste the final product, take very good notes and adjust my recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finally, I can say that with the correct procedure of beer making, an IPA can be enjoyed at various stages from 1 week and even up to one year and can still be enjoyed for its distinct hop flavor and aroma.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Could this perhaps have do do with the way people tend to drink these particular styles? In the circles I run in, Belgian- and Trappist-style beers tend to get revered, pondered, and savored, and thus drunk more slowly and possibly in lower quantities than IPAs, which are more plentiful, generally cheaper, and tend to get pounded by the six-pack next to some hot wings or a cheeseburger.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As stated many times above, it's very personal on what affects you and how much or how little.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Dry-hopped beers seem to give me worse hangovers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, 13 of the big bottles of Franziskaner in a night makes me want to die the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, Indian Pale Ale is not a type of beer you would typically find in Germany, and, as you hinted at, many Germans do not even know IPA. Furthermore, at least to my knowledge, none of the different styles prevalent in Germany (basically, bock and doppelbock are just beers with higher alcohol content and gravity) is a real alternative to IPA.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;BUT! over the last few years, there definitely was progress, and some small breweries startet producing IPA (see, for example, &lt;a href="http://www.schoppebraeu.de/unsere-biere.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Schoppebraeu&lt;/a&gt; (Berlin)). In addition, there are some small marketers that have IPA's in their range of products (see, for example, &lt;a href="http://www.braufactum.de/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Braufaktum&lt;/a&gt; with many points of sale in Germany and, especially, in Berlin).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I had the same impression in my first time in Germany, its a nation of good beers, but (maybe thanks to their old purity law), they are very closed on their own styles. I could say the same from Czech Republic.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Both nations make the best beers in the world in their main schools, but limited on other genres. And both mostly produce lagers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I never tasted a German beer simmilar to an IPA, but at least thanks to EU you can always buy something from England or Belgium&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;São Paulo has seen a big rise in the craft beer scene through the last years (as does the whole country), so you'll probably find what you're looking for. The city doesn't have an actual (physical) brewery of its own (besides brewpubs, which are only a few, the most relevant being Cervejaria Nacional), once most of them are in the countryside of São Paulo state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					Anyway, you won't be disappointed with beers available and bar options - Pinheiros region being the place where you'll find the best ones.
					Keep an eye open for Jupiter, Urbana, STP, which are gypsy breweries born in the city, and have a lot of modern styles (Black IPAs, American Wheat, Brown IPAs, APAs, etc). Urbana has a very good Belgian Strong Golden Ale called Gordelícia, by the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					Bamberg is a brewery dedicated to german styles, with some state-of-art german style reproductions with tons of international awards. Colorado is one of the oldest breweries in the country and, although it doesn't have a wide portfolio, its beers are easy to find at supermarkets, affordable and still very good. They have a very good english-american-hybrid IPA with 'rapadura' (a candy made of molasses). Invicta is one of my favorites from here, having from humble Weizenbiers to Imperial American IPAs, all very good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					Don't miss Empório Alto dos Pinheiros (EAP), the best craft-beer bar in the city, with 30+ taps and excellent food at a fair price. Ah, well, prices overall here aren't very good. Actually, even though the whole craft beer scene is growing faster and faster, taxes and other aspects of the market aren't doing it more affordable to people, but the opposite, unfortunately.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					Besides all that, you are certainly going to find beers from all over the country here, and I guarantee you won't be disappointed with many of them. If you like belgian styles, your best bet is Wals (not from São Paulo, but widely available over here), nowadays probably the best brewery brewing belgian traditional styles in the country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					PS: Off course we are not USA. You won't find six-packs here, nor even a 12oz Imperial IPA bottle for 3 bucks. But, willing to spend some money and knowing what to go for and what not, it's possible to drink good beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You may find a few microbreweries making IPAs there, but I have no idea how restrict are their distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sommelierbier.de/backbonesplitter.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Hans Müller Sommelierbier's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ale-mania.de/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ale-Mania's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.crewrepublic.de/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Crew Republic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Off course, if you're a hophead, your best bet is to wait for Stone to kick-off their production and distribution there.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As an advice: give german styles a chance too. In general, they're much less extreme than american ones, and definitely not hop-forward, but they have their own beauty. They're delicate, balanced and diverse. If you really like beer, explore as much as you can. You're probably going to find something that pleases you. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Repeatedly cooling and warming (to ambient temperatures) a beer can induce a permanent haze, where proteins and tannins bond to create semi-soluble molecules. While this can have an aesthetic impact, it does not impact flavour, aroma or mouthfeel. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is mostly an issue in beers where the knocking-out, or rapid cooling of the beer may not have been effective at precipitating what is known as cold-break proteins. Which generally leads to chill haze (haze when the beer is cool, but not when it is warm). This generally isn't an issue with most commercial beers (especially if filtered), and is more often found in home-brewed beers. &lt;/p&gt;

					  &lt;p&gt;Is there any standard that differentiates an XPA from other American
					  pale ales?&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Currently, no. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;According to the latest Beer Judge Certification Program guidelines (the drafted 2015 style guide &lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/docs/2015_Guidelines_Beer.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.bjcp.org/docs/2015_Guidelines_Beer.pdf&lt;/a&gt;), there is no category of XPA or Extra Pale Ale.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Stylistically, depending on the malt bill used, one would place the beer in either an American Pale Ale or IPA category, though most 'sub styles' the BJCP wants to have in the &lt;strong&gt;21B. Specialty IPA&lt;/strong&gt; category. If it was heavy in British malts, perhaps even an English IPA. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean, however, that a brewery can't just make up whatever they feel like to call their beer, which is what I believe is happening there. XPA sounds cool, new, and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The idea of the style has been around for a few years, at least back to 2013 as referenced by &lt;a href="http://www.homebrewtalk.com/showthread.php?t=382533" rel="nofollow"&gt;this HomeBrewTalk forum post&lt;/a&gt;. Even then there were debates as to the meaning of this style... and it still hasn't become anything of note.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Cooling and warming a beer &lt;strong&gt;does have an effect&lt;/strong&gt;, but it is minor in the beginning. If you heat, cool, repeatedly many times, there will be evidence of damage and it will become staggeringly obvious!
					At Budweizer they gave us a beer that was cycled over a 100 times! It was shocking how many off-flavours such a delicately flavoured beer can get!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I was recently in Burlington and picked up a couple of cases.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's a good beer.
					No, it's not as good as the hype suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One of the previous posts hit the nail on the head.  Heady Topper has a good balance between the strength and the hoppiness.  It has what I call smooth strength.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But is it worth driving up from Pennsylvania and following the delivery truck around - probably not&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would say some are sweeter, some aren't. Brewers do kick up the mount of malt in IIPA's to get the ABV up there. This could lead to a sweeter taste depending on the malt bill and fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yeast can just process a certain amount of sugar inside the mash and therefore in double IPA there can be more sugar left in the beer, depending on the yeast that is used.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To be classified as a double IPA it must have an ABV &gt;= 7.5%.  That requires more malt/sugar.  However, the perceived sweetness can be a factor from yeast used and the Bitterness Ratio: &lt;a href="http://www.madalchemist.com/chart_bitterness_ratio.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.madalchemist.com/chart_bitterness_ratio.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would argue that an overcarbonated IPA is still an IPA. IPAs are characterized by the intense hoppy aroma, a malt backbone, and color. The carbonation level isn't referred to in style guides, generally.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/116/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Beer Advocate's IPA Style Guide&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beerstyles/india-pale-ale-ipa/17/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ratebeer's IPA Style Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What I believe you're doing is creating a slightly more sour IPA. With more dissolved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the beer, you're creating slight amounts of carbonic acid, and &lt;a href="http://www.ask.com/science/acids-taste-sour-9162775ff5be382a" rel="nofollow"&gt;acids make things a bit more sour&lt;/a&gt;. Seems like a pretty cool variant of an IPA, actually. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Answer to the easiest part of the question: Yes, IPAs (India Pale Ales) are beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there isn't a clear and concise answer to the rest of you question. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that by "regular beer", you mean Budweiser. Budweiser sits at 5% ABV. IPAs are often in the 5-7% ABV range, so let's call an "average" IPA 6%. You will feel the alcohol substantially more quickly in the 6% IPA than in the 5% Budweiser.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Lifehacker has a &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/why-a-5-beer-gets-you-drunk-so-much-faster-than-a-4-b-1725622428"&gt;nice article&lt;/a&gt; that explains this phenomenon well, but it boils down to the rate at which your body can process alcohol. Suppose that 1% ABV corresponded to 1 "alcohol unit." If, for example, your body could process 4.5 alcohol units/hour, after 6 pints of a 5% ABV beer (1/hr), you'd have 3 alcohol units left in your body [(5.0-4.5)*6]. However, you'd reach the same mark after only 2 beers (1/hr) of a 6% ABV beer [(6-4.5)*2].&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;TL;DR Version: It probably has to do with the beer's ABV you were drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Side note: There is a lot of variability in strength within any given style. If you like IPAs, you should check out Session IPAs - They are IPAs designed to be lower in ABV than the average IPA, so you can drink more of them in a drinking "session." For a list of the top Session IPAs and more information on the style, check out &lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beerstyles/session-ipa/121/"&gt;Ratebeer's Session IPA page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The beer judge certification program style guides seem to imply they are the same.  You can get more details at bjcp.org.  The text below is from the 2015 guidelines double IPA category, 22A.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Comments: A showcase for hops, yet remaining quite 
					drinkable. The adjective “double" is arbitrary and simply 
					implies a stronger version of an IPA; “imperial,” “extra,” 
					“extreme,” or any other variety of adjectives would be equally 
					valid, although the modern American market seems to have 
					now coalesced around the “double” term.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A bit obvious, but it's just about more malt and hops (which results in higher ABV and IBU levels, off course).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Particularly, I don't see it becoming a new style, as our palate has a limit when it comes to tasting bitterness and even smelling hop oils. I think we have already reached this limit sometime ago when Imperial IPAs were conceived. So, anything beyond that seems like a silly obsession to me, and probably the best that one can get from a "triple IPA" is to come up with a good Imperial/Double IPA with (maybe) more alcohol, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;PS: Dogfish's 120 Minute IPA would be a quadruple IPA, then?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;An IPA style beer has an ABV from 6% on the low end to 10% on the high end, although the higher alcohol ones are labeled as Double IPA of Imperial.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That is probably more substantial than "regular" beer, however that is defined.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another thing to consider is the body of an IPA.  It will tend to be more malty and thicker than say a Budweiser and that will also affect how you feel.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most often, if you see IPA, it's an "India pale ale".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"Imperial pale ale" is an informal, descriptive style (i.e., a strong pale ale), whereas "india pale ale" is a &lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style14.php" rel="noreferrer"&gt;BJCP recognized style&lt;/a&gt;.  India pale ales are primarily understood as a hopped-up version of a pale ale, made to withstand long travels.  Beers with an "imperial" nomenclature (typically synonymous with "double") are brewed to be a stronger, higher ABV -- think double IPAs, imperial stouts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For a variety of reasons, IPA's are generally brewed with higher specific gravities, resulting in a higher (on average) alcohol content by volume.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Without getting too technical, just as others have stated the alcohol content will vary from a traditional run of the mill beer like Budweiser vs something craft like an ipa. The ipa tends to run a little higher in alcohol by volume than Budweiser or similar brands. For example I can down 4-5 modelos Negra without feeling took buzzed but this year I tried pumpkinator and it only too 2 to get me buzzed the ABV is 10% for the pumpkinator vs 5.4% for the modelo&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;[English] India Pale Ales (BJCP Style 14A) were shipped to India (and elsewhere) during the late 18th Century.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;[American] India Pale Ales (BJCP Style 14C) are significantly different.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Imperial Pale Ales (BJCP Style 14C) refer to a relatively stronger (in alcohol) beer.  They are a modern invention by American Craft Brewers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The "Imperial" part of the name though, has some interesting history.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;During the 1698-1700's "Porter" beer was exported from England to the court of Russia.  However during initial shipment, the long journey ruined the beer.  Barklay's Brewery in London significantly increased both the alcohol and hops in the beer to help it prevent spoilage during the trip.  This beer became known as "Russian &lt;strong&gt;Imperial&lt;/strong&gt; Stout".  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am now drinking a beer from a keg from last weekend. I left the beer keg inside my storage with door open and it's been warm this week (100°F). Five days later the beer tastes almost same exept that the beer foam has gone which in my opinion the beer foam gives it a better taste.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Be mindful of the variety of IPA on the US market -- the average New England IPA is a different beast than the average west coast IPA. I'll call out a few excerpts from the &lt;a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2012/03/what-to-eat-with-ipa-india-pale-ale-food-pairings.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;serious eats article&lt;/a&gt; Andrew Cheong quotes above:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;IPAs that lean extra-heavily on bitterness can be a bit tricky to match with food, which can make the beer seem astringent.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;...IPAs that emphasize hop flavor and aroma over bitterness...I especially like these beers when served with Indian food. Hop flavor melds wonderfully with common Indian spices like tamarind, coriander, and cardamom.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Mexican food mixes light and dark flavors like cilantro and refried beans, lime and roasted chilies. Those combinations make great partners for IPA with its own caramel/citrus combo. Stick with lighter-bodied beers here, since bigger brews can easily overwhelm.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My personal experience -- I predominantly drink IPA these days -- is that I haven't had a memorably bad pairing, save for once where an overly sweet cupcake clashed with the bitterness of the IPA. But that was likely an exceptionally high-IBU beer. (I suddenly feel the need to gather more data).&lt;/p&gt;
