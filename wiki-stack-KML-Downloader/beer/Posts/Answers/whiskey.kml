					&lt;p&gt;Aging or 'Finishing' is an extension of the maturation process, when the spirit is subsequently filled into empty casks that previously held other
					wines or spirits for a further relatively short period at the end of maturation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The selection of casks can affect the character of the final whisky.
					  Outside of the United States, the most common practice is to reuse
					  casks that previously contained American whiskey, as US law requires
					  several types of distilled spirits to be aged in new oak casks. To
					  ensure continuity of supply of used oak casks some Scottish distilling
					  groups own oak forests in the US and rent the new barrels to bourbon
					  producers for first fill use. Bourbon casks impart a characteristic
					  vanilla flavour to the whisky.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;so really the longer you age the whiskey the more of the flavor you are going to capture form the cask &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, we have to understand &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; we age whiskey in the first place.  It's primarily to extract compounds from the wood of the barrels (and any previous contents) so that they can add flavor and complexity to the final product.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From there, there are several factors that determine how long a typical aging period might be.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the wood in the barrels is new, or has been previously used.   Bourbon, which is typically aged as few as 4 years is aged in casks of new wood, meaning there are more compounds in the wood to be extracted, and they can be extracted more quickly.  Scotch, on the other hand, which is often aged from 10-25 years, is aged in previously used barrels, so it takes longer to extract the desired level of flavoring compounds.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much flavor you want the wood to add to the finished product.  A Rye, aged for 10 years, is going to have a lot more oak than you would want in say, an Anejo Tequila, which will often be aged for just a year or two.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of wood can have an impact as well.  Most whiskeys are aged in American or French oak, but if other woods are used, a tighter grain, or different wood chemistry can mean that you need more time in the barrel to the get the flavors that you want.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A true Scotch whisky has to be aged at least 5 years to qualify as whisky. Beyond that, the factors that change over time are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;colour &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;nose &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;flavour&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The whisky takes on these from the wood, and from the previous contents. So for a really well rounded whisky, especially for a full bodies peaty, smoky whisky, that age is essential. That said, there are some amazing young whiskies, and some older whiskies that aren't as nice, so this comes down to taste,&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In fact there is a current furore in the industry about No Age Statement whiskies, as various blends are being sold off young, potentially putting the longer term whiskies in jeopardy as volumes will be necessarily reduced in the long term, becuase of a drive for shorter term profits...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The alcohol content &lt;strong&gt;decreases&lt;/strong&gt; as the &lt;a href="http://www.whiskymag.com/glossary/angels_share.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Angel's Share&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; leaves the cask over the years.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It would seem like you hit the nail on the head:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The main benefit would be that distillers can put out whisky that's younger and still charge a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the Scotch market age isn't just a sign of quality, it's also a sign of status. Rich people will spend a lot of money on bottles that are as old as 25 to 50 years, even if there is a very minimal difference in the actual flavour of the tipple. This means that an age statement can lend itself to a lot of profitability, or lack thereof.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;By excluding age statements that allows distillers to put out product faster, and not have to correlate their pricing model with age necessarily.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The cons to a distiller would be very minimal as the average consumer doesn't think too much about this type of thing, knowledge about whisky is typically very low. The only real con is to a consumer that may be getting fleeced by marketing tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The main reason to chill filter a whisky is actually purely cosmetic&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Chill filtering is a processes that makes sure that a whiskey wont go cloudy if water or ice is added to it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;it is mainly only done as people don't want to see a cloudy whiskey so it is done a a cosmetic touch to make the whiskey more appealing &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;although if a whiskey is above 46% this process is not necessary as the alcohol level will stop the cloudiness from happening &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;it is causing a bit of bother with whiskey distillers as people want a natural organic whiskey so they don't want it to go through the process of chill filtering but they also want a nice clear whiskey &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;for more in formation see &lt;a href="http://www.whiskyforeveryone.com/whisky_basics/chill_filtration.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Bourbon is a type of whiskey, whereas not all whiskies are bourbons!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.diffen.com/difference/Bourbon_vs_Whiskey"&gt;Bourbon&lt;/a&gt; is a type of whiskey that gets its name from Bourbon County, Kentucky, where it originated. Bourbon tends to be amber-colored, and a little sweeter and heavier in texture than other whiskeys. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What make a bourbon a bourbon and not just an ordinary whiskey? The following is from Men's Journal: &lt;a href="http://www.mensjournal.com/food-drink/drinks/what-exactly-is-the-difference-between-bourbon-and-whiskey-20140905"&gt;What, Exactly, Is the Difference Between Bourbon and Whiskey?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The most popular form of American whiskey is bourbon, which has its own specific definition. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;"Bourbon needs to be produced in America and made from 51 percent corn, and whisky does not," says Maker's Mark Master Distiller Greg Davis. Bourbon also needs to be stored in new charred-oak barrels, whereas whiskey barrels do need to be oak but not new or charred. "Lastly, to be called bourbon, the liquid needs to be distilled to no more than 160 proof and entered into the barrel at 125." For other whiskies the liquid must be distilled to no more than 190 proof. David notes that this isn't just common practice — "it's actual bourbon law."  &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Makes a Bourbon: A Cheat Sheet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Must be made in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Must contain 51 percent corn.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Must be aged in new oak charred barrels.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Must be distilled to no more than 160 proof and entered into the barrel at 125 proof.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Must be bottled at no less than 80 proof.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Must not contain any added flavoring, coloring or other additives.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The following is taken from &lt;a href="http://www.diffen.com/difference/Bourbon_vs_Whiskey"&gt;Bourbon vs. Whiskey:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Somewhat like champagne isn't champagne unless it's made in Champagne, France, Bourbon is not actually "Bourbon" if it is made outside the USA, even though other whiskeys may adhere to the same recipe and distillation guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tennessee Whiskey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The legal requirements for whiskey to be called Tennessee Whiskey are that the whiskey should be: &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;-distilled in Tennessee &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;-made from at least 51% corn &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;-filtered through maple charcoal, and &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;-aged in new, charred oak barrels.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;This is the process by which Jack Daniel's is manufactured. The company is the largest whiskey producer in Tennessee and wields an outsize influence on liquor laws in the state; they lobbied the state legislature to create such stringent requirements for labeling Tennessee Whiskey. Other whiskey producers in the state, including UK-based Diageo that owns Tennessee's No. 2 whiskey distiller George Dickel, oppose these criteria and are lobbying to have them loosened. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some consider Tennessee Whiskey a Bourbon, while most do not. The fact remains that both Tennessee Whiskey and Jack Daniel's are filtered through maple charcoal making them a different product. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addendum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is scotch?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The main difference between &lt;a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/30278/what%E2%80%99s-difference-between-scotch-whiskey-and-bourbon"&gt;scotch&lt;/a&gt; and whisky is geographic, but also ingredients and spellings. Scotch is whisky made in Scotland, while bourbon is whiskey made in the U.S.A, generally Kentucky. Scotch is made mostly from malted barley, while bourbon is distilled from corn. If you’re in England and ask for a whisky, you’ll get Scotch. But in Ireland, you’ll get Irish whiskey (yep, they spell it differently for a little colour).&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long should &lt;a href="http://www.scotch-whisky.org.uk/understanding-scotch/faqs/"&gt;Scotch Whisky&lt;/a&gt; be aged?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;It is not possible to lay down any precise age as being the best for a particular whisky. Generally speaking, Malt Whiskies require longer to mature fully than Grain Whiskies. UK and EU law insist that Scotch Whisky should be at least three years old. However, it is the practice of the trade to mature for substantially longer than the legal minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is rye?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thrillist.com/vice/rye-vs-bourbon-vs-scotch-whiskey-types-explained-guide-to-different-types-of-whisky-whiskey"&gt;Rye whisky&lt;/a&gt;, like its name suggests, is a whiskey that is distilled from at least 51% rye. What is rye? Rye is a type of grass that is a member of the wheat tribe and closely related to barley. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canadian whisky&lt;/strong&gt; is simply a rye whisky.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_whiskey#Legal_requirements" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; is a great resource.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The Federal Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits (27 C.F.R. 5) state 
					  that bourbon made for U.S. consumption[18] must be:&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ul&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Produced in the United States[19]&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Made from a grain mixture that is at least 51% corn[20]&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Aged in new, charred oak barrels[20]&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Distilled to no more than 160 (U.S.) proof (80% alcohol by volume)[20]&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Entered into the barrel for aging at no more than 125 proof (62.5% alcohol by volume)[20]&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Bottled (like other whiskeys) at 80 proof or more (40% alcohol by volume)[21]&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ul&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Daniel%27s" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jack Daniel's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The product meets the regulatory criteria for classification as a straight 
					  bourbon, though the company disavows this classification and markets it simply 
					  as Tennessee whiskey rather than as Tennessee bourbon.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The differences between &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; drinks (&lt;em&gt;"made for U.S. consumption"&lt;/em&gt;), and the difference between whiskey and bourbon are two separate questions (the former has been well answered).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From what I can gather on the whiskey it is bottled at 40% which is low  for a scotch&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;so taking this into consideration I would have a guess at this whiskey being around the 10-12 year old mark but nobody can really be certain as all 6 of the Warrior series did not have an age on the bottle&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hard spirits naturally &lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-0277.2009.01116.x/full" rel="noreferrer"&gt;degrade over time once opened&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You've already opened the bottle because you wanted to actually enjoy the drink, here are step you can take to help ensure the slow and unstoppable flavor degradation takes as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Store out of the light in a cool and dry place. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A good general rule of thumb for just about any type of alcohol is to store the bottles in a cool, dry, and dark location this will prevent any fluctuation in the environment from causing changes and prevent UV radiation from getting in. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Keep the bottle completely sealed.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.alcademics.com/2015/09/science-on-how-spirits-change-or-age-in-the-bottle-rather-than-the-barrel.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Whiskey and other spirits will not mature&lt;/a&gt; like a wine in a bottle over time, in fact using an open cork will likely contribute to the breakdown of the flavor as the spirit will have more opportunity to oxidize. A proper rubber stop/cork will do the job just fine. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to "age" a whiskey your best bet would be to store it in a small used whiskey cask or in a sealed class bottle with whiskey cask staves added. Both will allow the whiskey to absorb more flavors over time. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is a way peatiness or smokiness is measured scientifically: the phenol count in parts per million (PPM) however this isn't as useful as it sounds, as different phenols taste and smell different. Using the phenol measurement you can chart some examples as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Ardbeg - 55&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Laphroaig - 40&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Lagavulin - 35&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Caol Ila - 30&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Talisker - 25&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Highland Park - 20&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Of more use is a chart such as this one from &lt;a href="http://www2.malts.com/index.php/en_gb/Choosing-Whisky/A-World-of-Flavour/The-Single-Malt-Whisky-Flavour-Map" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;malts.com&lt;/a&gt;, which gives a simple way to visualise where a particular whisky sits, and the distance between that whisky and others the drinker may have tried previously.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x8P9D.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x8P9D.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Or this one in the &lt;a href="https://www.scotchwhiskyexperience.co.uk/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Scotch Whisky Experience&lt;/a&gt; in Edinburgh:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2RHR0.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2RHR0.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;(Look at how high Talisker sits on the charts, compared with its position on the phenol measurement...)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;No Age Statement (NAS) Scotch Whiskies give you only one item of information you can rely on - they are at least 3 years old (otherwise they can not be called Whisky)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The 40% gives you no useful information - in the Warrior range you have:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Svein - 40% - 40Euro&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Einar - 40% - 53Euro&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Harald - 40% - 75Euro&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Sigurd - 43% - 150Euro&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Ragnavald - 44.6% - 400Euro&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Thorfinn - 45.1% - 1000Euro&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;(Taken from &lt;a href="http://www.somersetwhisky.com/review-highland-parks-warrior-series/" rel="nofollow"&gt;somersetwhisky.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Those first 3 are all 40% alcohol but are very different blends from different casks. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There higher end of this range is likely to be older, and higher quality, and the Thorfinn has a specified 60% first fill cask (hence its colour and rich flavour) but they will each have whisky from casks of a variety of ages from 3 years and upwards, chosen in order to give the end product the required characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As with all whiskies - try the ones you can and go with the ones you like :-)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The bottle you are talking about will be 6 years old: it ages from the day of distillation and it will stop aging once it has been bottled (properties can change but for all intents and purposes it has stopped aging once it has been bottled)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would even go on to say that it will pretty much be impossible to find a whiskey that is from this year as they will need some time to distill and bottle. I would say the earliest you will be able to get a whiskey distilled in 2016 would be about 4 years from now as whiskey takes time to make, so be patient you will be able to get a bottle from 2016 just not yet.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can buy a cask of newly made whisky.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://Arranwhisky.com/cask-offer" rel="nofollow"&gt;Arran whisky&lt;/a&gt; offers a newly barreled whisky, price includes insurance and 10 years of bond storage.  It's £1850 for 200 liters.  After 10 years they'll bottle it at £30 per 12 bottle crate and you can sell it or drink it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The problem is, even if there were an objective measure of "smokeiness", there are different sorts of smoke tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Usually &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,4,6-Trichlorophenol"&gt;TCP ("phenol")&lt;/a&gt; content is the numeric measure of how smokey a given Scotch is, ranging from 0 pmm or close to it, up to around 170 pmm (Octomore).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, there are a number of problems with that measurement being used. The biggest is that TCP only measures a specific component of smoke flavor, and in fact one of somewhat less importance. TCP is responsible for the sharp, chemical smoke flavor. However, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon"&gt;polycyclic aromatics&lt;/a&gt; are responsible for the majority of "smoke" flavor. In fact, many fuels, such as wood, create relatively low proportions of TCP compared to peat. As such, it is more of a ballpark figure, and even then only if you are discussing alcohols smoked with the same fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Because of those different compounds, the actual nature of smoke flavors vary wildly depending on the fuel and its origin, not just how much of it is used. Here are some examples of how I would classify the smoke flavor of various alcohols:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Laphraoig: Cigar smoke&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Ardbeg: Bonfire, "iodine"&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Highland Park: Bacon&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Octomore: Chemical, biting&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Vita (Mezcal, not Scotch): A forest fire&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As implied by the terminology I chose, it can be difficult to separate the smoke taste from the other tastes involved. There is even disagreement as to what constitutes "smoke"/"peatiness" - are "iodine" and/or "phenol" part of it, or entirely separate? If they are separate, can people reasonably separate them in tasting?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am skeptical how useful a number could possibly be with the wide variety of smoke flavors to discuss. It's not just that the number would amalgamate many distinct flavors, it's also that different people are differently sensitive to the varying flavor compounds and might find the numbers ill-represent their actual experience because of that. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As such, any number you might come up with is going to have a wide margin of error, since no one is going to agree on how "smokey" a given alcohol is.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is of course theoretically possible to generate a number based on analysis of many different flavor compounds. However, that has not been done, and likely will not be. Even if it was, people would still have differing sensitivities. The closest you are likely to get is TCP ppm measurements and arbitrary numbers offered by reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You should &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; keep the cork wet. The high alcohol content of most distilled spirits will begin to dissolve the cork, which is highly undesirable. They should always be stored upright. This applies to metal screw tops as well, as metal catalyzes the breakdown of organic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To improve the lifespan, the best thing you can do is keep the bottle in a cool, dark place. While it is true oxidation cannot happen without air, it is far slower without energy present, and reducing light-heat is much easier than removing air.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are able to keep the bottle in complete dark and below ~70F, it will last far longer. I store mine in a cabinet in my kitchen, and I have an Islay Scotch that has been open for 4 years and shows no signs of degrading, despite smoke being among the most easily destroyed flavors.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always void sunlight.&lt;/strong&gt; UV will quickly degrade the flavor of spirits. While the glass of most bottles blocks some UV, any getting through is extremely harmful.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Something else that can be done is to transfer partially filled bottles into smaller bottles. If you have half of a 0.750L, you might transfer it into 0.375L. This would reduce surface area and the amount of air in the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are committed to preserving a bottle that you do not often use, wine stores sell cans of Xenon which can be sprayed into bottles. The Xenon is heavier than air and covers the surface, preventing oxygen from coming in contact with the liquid. However, this is fairly expensive and will not prevent forms of heat/light degradation other than oxidation&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Legally, a &lt;a href="http://www.scotch-whisky.org.uk/understanding-scotch/faqs/"&gt;Scotch Whisky&lt;/a&gt; is a distilled spirit made in &lt;strong&gt;Scotland&lt;/strong&gt; from cereals, water and yeast and has been matured for a period of not less than three years &lt;a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/2890/regulation/3/made"&gt;(The Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="http://whiskyadvocate.com/2010/03/12/what-is-irish-whiskey/"&gt;Irish Whiskey&lt;/a&gt; is distilled in &lt;strong&gt;Ireland&lt;/strong&gt; and aged for a minimum of three years in oak barrels.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Thus an Irish distillery can not produce a Scottish whisky!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However our question does not end here because the Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009 define &lt;a href="http://www.scotch-whisky.org.uk/understanding-scotch/faqs/"&gt;five categories&lt;/a&gt; of Scotch Whisky:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;•Single Malt Scotch Whisky: A Scotch Whisky distilled at a single distillery.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Single Grain Scotch Whisky: A Scotch Whisky distilled at a single distillery.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Blended Scotch Whisky: A blend of one or more Single Malt Scotch Whiskies with one or more Single Grain Scotch Whiskies.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Blended Malt Scotch Whisky: A blend of Single Malt Scotch Whiskies which have been distilled at more than one distillery.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Blended Grain Scotch Whisky: A blend of Single Grain Scotch Whiskies which have been distilled at more than one distillery.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But some &lt;a href="http://www.scotch-whisky.org.uk/understanding-scotch/faqs/"&gt;Scotch Whiskies&lt;/a&gt; have a smoky flavor which originates from the peat fire over which the green malt is dried, prior to grinding and mashing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hold on for one moment, "in &lt;a href="http://whiskyadvocate.com/2010/03/12/what-is-irish-whiskey/"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, whiskeys distilled at Cooley are only distilled twice, and they make smoky whiskeys there too (Connemara)."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Thus the question as what the differences are between an Irish Whisk&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;y and a Scotch whisky, other than how one spells &lt;strong&gt;whiskey&lt;/strong&gt; remains a question of geography! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Newcastle (Brown Ale) + Maker's Mark (Bourbon)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Slightly inexpensive and the flavors blend pretty well. A lot of people have reservations on Newcastle though.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sheaf (Stout) + Laphroaig (Scotch)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Laphroaig is the smokiest scotch I've had, and it sits nicely with a heavy stout or porter. I like a porter called Baltika number 6, but it's russian so you may not be able to get that one. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Having drank these when I was younger, I'd offer the opinion that beer and whisky &lt;em&gt;shouldn't be mixed&lt;/em&gt;. The flavours, generally speaking, are usually not complementary, so the only real benefit you'll get from them is a quicker buzz.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you want to go ahead with a boilermaker anyway I'd recommend getting a mid-range bottle of whisky. Something with some semblance of flavour and quality, but not so good that you're wasting a good liquor by mixing it with beer. Come to think of it, this rule probably holds true when mixing with anything, although I tend to use fairly cheap whiskies for cocktails. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In terms of specific whiskies, you could go with something like a &lt;strong&gt;Bulleit Bourbon&lt;/strong&gt; or a &lt;strong&gt;Black Bush Irish Whisky&lt;/strong&gt;, and if those are too pricey you could down-grade to a &lt;strong&gt;Wild Turkey&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Crown Royal&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The beer you choose depends much more on your taste in beer, as the flavour of beer varies much more than does the flavour of whisky. In general, if you mix with a lighter, more generic beer the flavour of the whisky will be quite strong, whereas if you go with a stronger flavoured beer the whisky will be more subtle. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If it were me, I'd go the stronger route to mask the taste of the whisky, because when I drink a beer that's not really what I want to taste. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You will find that Porters/Stouts tend to hold up to whiskey/bourbon/scotch better than others. Though, I'm sure you'll find exceptions.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One of my favorites is &lt;a href="http://newhollandbrew.com/our-beer/dragons-milk/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;New Holland's - Dragon's Milk&lt;/a&gt; with about 1.5-2 ounces of Crown Royal.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking a boilermaker is designed to get you drunk quick and mask the the potency and flavor of the whiskey in the beer.  That's why you are supposed to shoot it, to get it over with.  I recommend you don't use craft beers or anything above mid-grade whiskey. The special qualities and flavors that set those things apart will probably be lost.  Also keep in mind that a boilermaker is particularly expensive drink even using bottom shelf liquor, be wary of spending craft beer/top shelf liquor money on a drink designed to last less than 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, for something lively or with pronounced flavor you may want to try something slightly outside of traditional.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Angry Balls:
					Drop Cinnamon Whiskey(like Fireball) into a 1/2 glass of Spiked Apple Cider(Like Angry Orchard.
					This is sweet and easy to drink, its known to get a party rolling&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps one of the most famous of these kinds of drinks:
					The Irish Car Bomb(I did not make the name up):
					Drop a shot glass with 1/2 Irish Whiskey and 1/2 Irish Cream into 1/2 pint of Guiness.&lt;br&gt;
					This creates a flavor similar to a chocolate malt.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you really want a classic boilermaker I suggest going cheap.
					Drop some Old Crow into a 1/2 glass of PBR.  Somehow they improve each other and make something that is actually enjoyable (by the third glass).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://whisky.suntory.com/?gclid=CMaJ_ZKsiNECFcglgQod_xMPyg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Suntory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.kavalanwhisky.com/en/index2.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Kavalan&lt;/a&gt; whiskey have really put Asian Whiskey on "the map." The Yamazaki Single Malt Sherry Cask, by Suntory even won &lt;a href="https://blog.thewhiskyexchange.com/2014/11/jim-murrays-whisky-bible015-the-winners/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Jim Murray's Whiskey of the Year in 2015&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The styles are the same as other distiller's, though I am sure there are a few exceptions. &lt;a href="https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/23928/nikka-coffey-grain-whisky" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Nikka Coffee Grain Whiskey&lt;/a&gt; comes to mind. The difference - it seems - is in the craftsmanship. Whatever the Asian distillers are doing... people agree they are doing well.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a Yamazaki 12 owner - I highly recommend you purchase a bottle. Everyone I've ever let try it (I don't tell people when I hand it to them to avoid the "oh I heard this is great so let me rave about it" effect) absolutely raves about it. Even my wife, who normally hates the smell of my spirits, will sip on this neat. If the price tag scares you away, find a friend willing to share a sip or two.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes and no. If you use it at 100% strength it might be a good sterilizer but just a small amount in water isn't going to do much.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There have been studies on the effects of whiskey as a disinfectant, and it works reasonably well as so many old western stories of a splash of whisky on a bullet wound have attested, even if they probably only fictional.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, as Steve indicated in his answer, as a water purifier, it isn't going to do much.  The ethanol concentrations that you need in order to kill bacteria roughly bottom at what you get in whiskey itself.  Drop below 30% or so, and I haven't seen any study that shows any effectiveness as those levels.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, while you could potentially cut your whiskey with a little creek water, and after an hour or so have something that was slightly less potent and fairly safe to drink, it won't give you much in the way of what we might generally think of as purified water. For that, you'll need to stick to water purification tablets or a good filter.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;No. There is no "objective" way to map your tastes to what is in the bottle. It's purely a subjective exercise. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is also this website &lt;a href="https://www.masterofmalt.com/samples/"&gt;Master of Malt Samples&lt;/a&gt; that might be able to ship 3cl bottles to you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately there's no good way to guarantee you'll get something you'll like. However, there are some things you can do to help:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Find reviews that you agree with of whisk(e)ys you like. Note who wrote them and how they described the spirit. Try to find other reviews by those reviewers and look for the same descriptors. Ignore words like "smooth" and pay more attention to flavor notes. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Keep your own notes about what you like and what you taste when you drink what you like. Use the vocabulary that you and the reviewers you trust use as a guide for what is likely to be in your wheelhouse. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This won't be perfect. I don't recommend spending $200 on a bottle with this. But for the midtier it's not a bad approach. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're serious about upper tier stuff, find a good bar that has some of these whiskeys and go try them there. Find a local whiskey society to join or look out for tasting events (they happen more often than you'd think). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The only real way to select whiskies you like is to taste them. The question is how to do this without investing in whole bottles. The obvious approach is to visit an establishment that provides whiskey "flights", usually bars or restaurants that feature whiskeys. Generally this is a set of four or five small pours of a variety of whiskeys. Sometimes you can mix and match, but other times I've seen flights with a theme such as Irish whiskey or different regions of Scotch. Try Googling "whiskey flights near me". In addition, some larger retail stores (such as Binnys in the Chicago area) have whiskey tastings.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is not common.  I am surprised Jamie found one.  +1&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Jägermeister is common to be served cold but it is not a whiskey.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If they serve beer in frozen mugs you could ask for a shot in a frozen beer mug. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Great question for the dessert enhancement front.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Zabaglione is generally thought as sweet, however it can also be made without sugar, using dry wine and egg yolks, thus becoming a fine sauce for fish, chicken or vegetables. It is used this way in French cuisine as well as Italian. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;In Italy chefs and home cooks often measure the ingredients for zabaglione quite casually. Six egg yolks, for example, would be combined with six egg shells of sugar and 12 of wine or liqueur. Although Marsala is most often used for zabaglione, there is no reason why other wines or liqueurs can't be substituted, depending on the final flavor desired. Italian recipes usually call for dry Marsala. If a sweet wine or liqueur is used, the amount of sugar should be substantially decreased. Grand Marnier, Sauternes, Madeira, oloroso sherry, Southern Comfort, anisette, coffee- flavored liqueurs, Amaretto or La Grande Passion, the new passion- fruit liqueur, are just a few of the possibilities. - &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/03/nyregion/food-zabaglione-an-italian-dessert.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;ZABAGLIONE, AN ITALIAN DESSERT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally, I would not use whiskey or cognac in this dessert. But this is a personal preference. I am impartial to either a blackberry wine or strawberry wine. When I say these particular wines, I mean real blackberry wine and not simply blackberry flavored wine. It makes a difference in my mind. &lt;strong&gt;All said and done whiskey can be used in zabaglione&lt;/strong&gt; and in fact here is an Italian recipe for it. The following is in Italian:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Sbattete 4 tuorli con 60 g di zucchero, versate a filo 1/2 dl di whisky e cuocete a bagnomaria, montando con una frusta. Montate 1 dl di panna e unitela allo zabaione. Per un'alternativa sprint: Zabov (0,70 litri, 8,50 e). -  &lt;a href="http://ricette.donnamoderna.com/zabaione-al-whisky" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Zabaione al whisky&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mylastsupper.com/2011/08/angela-hartnett-zabaglione-recipe/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Angela Hartnett’s zabaglione recipe&lt;/a&gt; uses whiskey, brandy and a sweet wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;How about an Irish Zabaglione recipe and once again it is in Italian: &lt;a href="http://www.irlandaonline.com/cultura/cucina/ricette/zabaione-irlandese/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Zabaione Irlandese.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Bon Appetite and Pleasant Drinks Everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Just like wine, whisky demands a reasonable glass that will help rather than hinder the aromas. Avoid shot glasses and wide-mouthed tumblers, and go for something like the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glencairn_whisky_glass" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Glencairn Whisky Glass&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href="https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/2349/twe-whisky-glass" rel="noreferrer"&gt;tulip glass&lt;/a&gt; or even a brandy snifter.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Pour an amount that will let you swirl the whisky without sloshing it. Swirl it to coat the sides, which will allow you to smell it better. Observe the "legs", but don't be fooled by superstitions attached to them, they're a consequence of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marangoni_effect" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Marangoni Effect&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6w0tSg-msk" rel="noreferrer"&gt;fascinating video&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Stick your nose over the glass's opening and inhale very gingerly. Avoid knocking your smell receptors out. Save the deep breaths for after step 5.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;(optional) Take a tiny sip (again save your enthusiasm for after you have tasted it diluted, or you risk numbing your taste and smell receptors), and just like wine, let it run over all of your tongue, and like wine "chew" it to allow the air you are intaking to bring the aromas and flavors to the back of your nose. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Drink some water and possibly eat something neutral. Add a few drops of (&lt;em&gt;good quality&lt;/em&gt;) water to the whisky, try to take the ABV to around 35%ish.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Stick your nose deeper into the glass and smell. I'd still suggest being a little cautious until you learn the glasses and your nose. It would be a pity to numb yourself at this stage.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Take a sip, let it run all over your tongue. "Chew" it... Savor it.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Try to learn something about the whisky you are drinking and associate how it was made with what you are tasting. Was it peated? Is it kept by the sea? What type of oak is used? How old is it? All these things will drastically affect the flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are drinking the whisky to taste it, please do not skip step 5 (&lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/11183118/Thinking-Drinkers-should-you-add-water-to-whisky.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Note 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.rsc.org/images/whisky_tcm18-138981.pdf" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Note 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scotchaddict.com/diluting-scotch-with-water.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Note 3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.khymos.org/2007/06/03/new-perspectives-on-whisky-and-water/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Note 4&lt;/a&gt;). You can always decide you prefer a whisky undiluted afterwards. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, you can decide you prefer ice &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; tasting it properly, despite Note 4's suggestions. By all means drink how you want to drink, but adding ice is prone to both over-cool the whisky (diminishing and changing its flavors) and also over-dilute it. Optimal temperature and strength will vary by whisky and by drinker's preferences (and season, etc.), but I'd aim to start your investigations at around 15-20C and around 30-35%.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The best advice is to adjust the quantity of the spirit to the percentage of alcohol it contains.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Assuming you drink responsibly, i can assure you that even a 91% spirit can be tasted and enjoyed like a pint of beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;EDIT: As always, i think i can let the personal experience talks, i tried one of the most powerful alcoholemic recipe i can in Italy, &lt;a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/it/Gocce_Imperiali" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Gocce imperiali&lt;/a&gt; and i can assure that if the sip is like 4/5 drops, is enjoyable&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your question is a bit broad because the flavour of high ABV spirits, and the intention of the spirits themselves vary widely.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some alcohols with a high ABV, such as Hungarian Palinka, are sometimes drunk purely for inebriation. They have a high alcohol content mainly to cause the intended effects, not to produce a pleasing drink. These types of spirits are also often flavourless and used to make cocktails with alcohol content.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I've had Scotches that were as high as 60% but very easily drunk neat, and quite pleasing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So in sum: whether and how someone enjoys a high ABV spirit really depends on the spirit and it's individual qualities.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally, I have never had &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haggis" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;haggis&lt;/a&gt;, but pairing it with wine is not all that uncommon. &lt;strong&gt;Some even pair it with beer&lt;/strong&gt; as can be seen &lt;a href="https://www.matchingfoodandwine.com/news/entertaining/planning-a-burns-night-dinner/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but I would go with a sweet fruity red wine. Pairing wine with haggis is very common on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is a sample of how people wine with haggis:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;A dram of whisky works better after the meal, as its sheer strength means it doesn’t go with the food, so which wine to open first? Red, of course, and something with enough richness to take on haggis, which is sheep’s (occasionally pig’s) “pluck” – the heart, liver and lights (lungs) – mixed with oatmeal, spices and seasoning. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;If you’re still with me (Susy Atkins) and up for it, a bold European red with a little savouriness and black pepper is by far the best. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Spanish tempranillo, aged in oak casks, and tasting of ripe red berries, wood spice and vanilla, is my favourite match. - &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinkadvice/11361111/Why-Ill-be-drinking-red-wine-not-whisky-with-my-haggis.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Why I'll be drinking red wine - not whisky - with my haggis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is another:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Haggis is quite a funky-tasting meat - a bit like a savoury, spicy sausage - so I think red wine is a better match than white. I’ve found big jammy reds such as Australian shiraz work well (there is appropriately enough one called Bobbie Burns shiraz (available for about £15-£16 from independents including &lt;a href="http://www.ahadleigh-wine.com/products/4993/Campbells+Bobbie+Burns+Shiraz+Rutherglen/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Alexander Hadleigh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.oldbutcherswinecellar.co.uk/campbell-s-bobbie-burns-shiraz-2010.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Old Butcher's Wine Cellar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Northern Rhône syrah and grenache/syrah/mourvèdre (GSM) blends from the southern Rhône, the Languedoc and Australia are also good matches, especially if they have a year or two’s bottle age. - &lt;a href="https://www.matchingfoodandwine.com/news/pairings/the-best-wines-to-pair-with-haggis/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The best wines to pair with haggis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And finally:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Wine pairing with haggis – grape growing and winemaking techniques&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Grapes grown in hotter climates often have riper fruit which add to flavour intensity and texture of the wine; but also the sugar levels in the grapes are generally much higher adding further mouthfeel, so a sign is to look for wines that have perhaps 13.5% or above alcohol by volume. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Oak fermentation and/or oak ageing adds flavour and texture too, so clues are sometimes on the label; be aware &lt;strong&gt;‘oaked’&lt;/strong&gt; is not generally a style that adds texture, look for the word &lt;strong&gt;‘aged’&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure it has seen the inside of an oak cask. This week on our WSET Level 2 Wine Course we had an outstanding Puligny-Montrachet and also a equally impressive Chateauneuf-du-Pape, both would have successfully met the haggis-pairing challenge. &lt;a href="http://enjoydiscoveringwine.com/2014/01/burns-night-wine-pairing-haggis/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Burns Night – wine pairing with haggis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;All said and done: Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think haggis calls for a whisky barrel-aged porter, an Irish stout, or a peated malt ale, preferably in vast quantities so that you: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;don't know what you're eating,&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;don't eat because you're too drunk.&lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have tried this with a nice Reposado, and it works well. But you are much better off with a nice whisky.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Or any other drink - it doesn't really matter. If you have a nice haggis the drink is irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;(disclaimer - I am Scottish)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I believe they're referring to stacks of boxes. Now, seeing as how bottles of whiskey can vary widely in price and stacks of boxes can be of any height, the phrase doesn't really mean anything at all. My conjecture is that, if it is a fictional series, this is one of the many instances in which a line sounds cool enough that no viewers catch on to the fact that it means nothing. You can see this all the time when &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodScience" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_19160_8-scenes-that-prove-hollywood-doesnt-get-technology.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; terms are thrown around on tv.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Just for fun let's make some assumptions. If a stack is &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-earthquake-country-wine-20140825-story.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;6 boxes high&lt;/a&gt; and you use something cheap like &lt;a href="http://www.binnys.com/spirits/Jim_Beam_Bourbon_190661.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;cases of Jim Beam&lt;/a&gt; two or three stacks would be between 2150 and 3240 dollars. That's a pretty wide range of numbers but not an unheard of price for a bottle of liquor. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can keep the expensive bottle though, I'll be hiding in the corner with my 200 bottles of whiskey.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;According to the urban dictionary web site, a stack is a G or $1,000.00 US dollars.
					This makes sense since the price of a bottle of Yamazaki 2013 Sherry Cask is $3,999.99 in 2017.

					&lt;p&gt;This question may end up being closed as too broad, as a full answer to this would include many lifetimes of experience by master distillers, and would have to incorporate opinions (some people find peaty, smoky whiskies absolutely foul and undrinkable while others would not ever want to drink a mild lowland whisky)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, I'll summarise my most critical ones, and the thoughts that guided me when distilling my own whisky:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging: the cask imparts the vast majority of the flavour, from the type of wood, the previous contents, how charred the cask is, length of time in the cask etc. The more desirable whiskies carefully choose casks and aging to deliver tastes that customers will like. This typically costs money (especially for storage costs) so a cheap whisky may not put so much effort into cask selection, quality control, age etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Middle Cut: The foreshots start off with mostly methanol so would not taste good, and are mostly poisonous, but a small amount of methanol is useful in the process (and evaporates first after casting as part of the Angel's Share anyway) so the decision when to extract the middle cut is essential. Similarly, the feints, which contain propanol and heavier fusel oils are not wanted so are fed back into the spirit still. But there will be a small amount in the final product. Knowing how much of the foreshots and feints to include is part of the master distiller's craft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speed of heating / shape of still: Tall stills give a very smooth clear taste, especially when slowly heated. Short, squat stills combined with rapid heating allow many more fusel oils and other substances into the distillate, which will make the flavour more interesting, but can lead to a lack of smoothness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some cheaper spirits get around some of these issues by multiple distillations to remove some of the more complex substances - this can lead to an easier flavour for drinking, but also to something far more boring (from the perspective of a whisky afficionado) and bland.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can obtain different varieties of Japanese Whiskeys in Canada. The real question (or two) is whether or not you can obtain a particular one and whether it is obtainable in Ontario?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Each province regulates what is permitted to be sold in their liquor stores.
					The official provincial list of products will vary from province to province. Here in BC, we can obtain the &lt;a href="http://www.bcliquorstores.com/product/358390" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;SUNTORY WHISKY - HIBIKI JAPANESE HARMONY&lt;/a&gt; at our Government Liquor Stores. For some reason, private liquor stores can obtain more products from the approved list than can the Government Liquor Stores. Why this is so, makes no sense to me at all. It is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If I were in Ontario, I would ask the Customer's Services at your neighboring liquor and see if they can obtain a Japanese Whiskey or two. If they can order it in, please be aware that you may have to buy a complete box, especially if the product in question is not a popular item. This is the rule in BC, however private stores often will waive that. &lt;strong&gt;Simply go and ask them in person, I do it all the time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another thing you might try is to go to a &lt;em&gt;Wine Market or Festival&lt;/em&gt; in your area. You may get lucky. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Although not a Wine Market in the strictest sense please check this out from Alberta: &lt;a href="https://www.kensingtonwinemarket.com/blog/?p=2661" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Kensington Wine Market&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;We’re Stocking up with a Dozen Whiskies from Nikka Whisky Co. of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;We love Japanese whisky here at KWM, and feel it is every bit as complex as the best Scotch whiskies. The following whiskies from Nikka Whisky Co. will be in stock at the Kensington Wine Market...&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For what was offered at the time see &lt;a href="https://www.kensingtonwinemarket.com/blog/?p=2661" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Once again, I encourage you to ask at your local Government Liquor Store in your area.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fivebladesbrewing.com/intro-to-sour-mashing/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;em&gt;kind of&lt;/em&gt; - answers your question. The breakdown of sour mashing in beer cannot be too different. The article linked explains the process with amazing detail. Here are some pertinent highlights:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Sour mashing requires only a small deviation from your normal routine and has three goals:&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; 1. Create an optimal environment for Lactobacillus.

					 2. Prevent spoiling organisms from producing foul aromatics and flavors.

					 3. Drop pH to produce desired amount of acidity/sourness.
					&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The main difference between sour mashing and kettle souring is that sour mashing occurs before sparging with the mashed grains still present while kettle souring occurs after sparging with the full pre-boil volume (and frequently in the boil kettle). Additionally, sour mashing will have a moderately higher gravity because it is undiluted first runnings.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RgONQ.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RgONQ.png" alt="Sour Mash Differences"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
					I assume the sour mashing aspect of this is what happens when distilling whiskey.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, I am answering &lt;em&gt;assuming&lt;/em&gt; you want to stick with single malts rather than go blended. Also because people live in different parts of the world, prices may vary.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would recommend Glenfiddich 12-y as a standard go to single malt and usually a bit cheaper than the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Other good brands include Dalwhinnie and Dalmore(this one being my personal favorite) but these prices will range around the same as your Aberlour.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I've once thought about getting cheaper single malts but I have never tasted a good cheap single malt. Were they decent? A few, most were not the greatest and I would not buy again. This has been my personal experience.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Are you looking for a single malt? Those may be a little more expensive. A blend like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Famous_Grouse" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Famous Grouse&lt;/a&gt; will include good scotches from the region including Glenturret. If you are looking for something a bit smokier, I am a fan of &lt;a href="http://thewhiskeyjug.com/scotch-whiskey/talisker-storm-review/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Talisker Storm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The problem you have is implied in the question: 'affordable' and 'good' Scotch don't really go hand in hand, depending on what you mean by affordable. It's not a matter of brands, it's a matter of the average entry-point for a quality product, which is surprisingly consistent. If a distillery produces a good whisky, they are going to price it according to it's quality.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In Canada, you can typically expect any bottle that costs over about 65 CDN to be what I'd call a good, drinkable Scotch. A good metric to go by is the price of a Glenmorangie Original, or Aberlour 12. These are two starter Scotches, and most bottles at or above their price point will be what I'd call a decent whisky.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Once you get under the prices of those two bottles you'll start seeing a hit in quality, and if you get significantly lower, like 30-40 you're talking an entire tier down.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said &lt;strong&gt;one recommendation&lt;/strong&gt; to look into is 'McClelland's'. It's most certainly not a premium Scotch, but it does perform well above it's price point.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another recommendation&lt;/strong&gt; I'd make is if entry-level and above Scotches are too expensive for you then check out some bourbon and Irish whiskies. Black Bush, Writer's Tears, and Bulleit Bourbon or Rye are quite drinkable whiskies for a much better price.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;FWIW, I'd also hazard against the Glenfiddich 12 recommendation above, it is affordable but is a notoriously weak Scotch.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Flavored Whiskey is often kept in the freezer/ fridge:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fireball&lt;/strong&gt; (cinnamon whiskey), although weaker than most whiskey and far sweeter is consistently kept cold.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Honey&lt;/strong&gt; (Honey flavored Whiskey) is smooth and sweet but has more of a whiskey kick that Fireball.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are several other kinds of flavored whiskey and many are kept refrigerated, but the above two are the most common.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For non-flavored the only whiskey I've seen kept on ice, although not consistently, is Yukon Jack.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I watched the episode of NCIS LA S8/19 and it makes sense. The reference meaning the bottle of whiskey they were drinking a Yamasaki 2013 Sherry Cask was worth 3 or 4 stacks ( $3000 -$4000). Cost $3999 in 2017&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Putting a bottle &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Daniel%27s" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Jack Daniels&lt;/a&gt; into the freezer for a couple of hours or so should be okay.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The average home freezer is about -17 C (-1 F). This is cold enough to freeze your food and ice, but &lt;strong&gt;not cold enough to freeze the average bottle of 80-proof liquor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Water freezes at 0 C (32 F) and the freezing point of pure ethanol alcohol is -114 C (-173.2 F). Alcoholic beverages are a mixture of both alcohol and water (in some cases, sugars and other additives as well) so the freezing point of your alcoholic beverages is somewhere in between.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The exact freezing point of vodka, tequila, rum, whiskey and liqueurs (as well as wine and beer) is dependent on its alcohol by volume (or its proof).&lt;/p&gt;

					  &lt;p&gt;64 Proof Liquor
					  32%: -23 C (-10 F) A liqueur like amaretto and a flavored whiskey like Fireball would fall in this range. These should be okay in the freezer. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;80 Proof Liquor
					  40%: -27 C (-17 F) Includes most standard base liquors like gin, vodka, whiskey, etc. You're clear for the freezer! - &lt;a href="https://www.thespruce.com/will-liquor-freeze-760302" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Is Your Beer, Wine, and Liquor Safe in the Freezer?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A distillery is just a building at the end of a day, the flavor of a whiskey comes from the ingredients and equipment used inside it. In whiskey making the equipment used makes a big difference in the end product, here's a non-exhaustive list:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Stills: stills are used to concentrate alcohol, the shape and material used for stills make a great difference in the end flavor of the whiskey&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Barrels: whiskey is aged for years, generally in barrels of some kind. The material used can make a big difference, for instance there's charred barrels, used wine or port barrels. The whiskey will take flavors from the barrel as it ages&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The ingredients that are used in whiskey making likewise make a big difference:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Grain: Barley, Rye, Wheat and Corn are all used in whiskey making, and each give whiskey a very different character&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Peat: peat smoke is widely used in scottish whiskey making, the amount and type of peat used gives the end product more or less flavor &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Yeast: the strain of yeast used in the fermentation will have an impact on flavor&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There's also conditions to consider like the temperature and length of the initial fermentation, still heat, etc. There's the number of times that a whiskey is distilled, triple distillation would give a very different character than double distilling. These are all under control and change the end product. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So a distiller with a single set of equipment using the same grain could make many different characters of whiskey by varying the process and types of barrel used. If they have different stills and use different grains a single distillery could make a very wide variety of whiskeys. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for this specific case, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanton%27s" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Blanton&lt;/a&gt; is a brand which is named after Albert Blanton, one of the founders of the Buffalo Trace distillery and who worked there for more than 5 decades. The same company (Sazerac) owns several distilleries and produces many different brands. For all I know they do just pour standard Buffalo Trace into the bottles and market it as something else, it wouldn't be the first time a company pulled that trick, however that would be bound to be noticed by aficionados and it wouldn't do their reputation any good. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I can't speak to the specific whiskies that you mention, but you're right that it's something of a marketing trick. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would assume what's happening is that specific distilleries have the capacity to produce a certain quantity of whisky, but the market for an individual brand is lesser than this quantity. So instead of producing a larger quantity of a single brand, they produce slightly different whiskies under different names to encourage the consumer to buy more. After all, it makes more sense to have three different whiskies, than three bottles of the same whisky.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When it comes to mass-produced bourbons you're not going to see a heck of a lot of difference between different varieties, so if you're set on that style I'd recommend just picking one that's somewhere in the middle of the price range (not on the bottom of the barrel, but also not artificially priced as a 'premium' product). FWIW, my go to bourbon is 'Bulleit'.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another avenue you could take is to go for some entry-level scotches, something like a Glenmorangie Original. It might be a bit higher priced than bourbon, but you're going to get a better whisky.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the sour mash process, the distillers beer is distilled, and a portion of the spent beer is added to the next batch. Many organic acids are not very volatile, so they will remain in the spent beer. Adding this to the sweet mash will add free amino nitrogen and organic acids to the sweet mash. Yeast likes a slightly acidic environment, and many bacteria and molds do not. Adding the spent beer help keep these spoilage organisms away while also adding nutrients to the mash. The spent beer also helps with flavor consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Bourbon is not different from whiskey...it is to be understood that "bourbon" is a type of whiskey which is distilled in America (USA) this is the answer in laymen language... Try to understand the idea that "scotch" is also a whiskey which is distilled in scotland... 
					So be it scotch, bourbon, rye they all are whiskey but the difference lies in their constituent ingredient (barley, corn)...blended or single malted... Origin place, taste and texture anf lastly the alcohol content... 
					Asking the difference between  "bourbon and whiskey" is just like asking the difference between "BMW and a CAR"
					I hope you get the idea.. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for affordable single-malts, I can recommend: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Deanston, Cardhu 12, Glenfarclas Heritage and some of the Glenfiddich's whiskeys.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another great Whiskey that I can recommend is "Jameson Black barrel".
					This is an Irish whiskey but it tastes different from most traditional Irish whiskeys. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'd say yes, but with the caveat that I've only tried a limited number of Irish whiskies (mostly big name brands) and so they might be a bit more varied than I'm aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm largely ignorant of what goes into the distilling process of both Irish whisky and Scotch, but what I notice as a taster is that Irish whisky is often very sweet, with more like a sugary or fruity taste to it. I'd normally recommend them to people with a sweet-tooth.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Scotch can be very sweet too, but I find the Sherry versions often with more of a butterscotch/caramel flavour, and if they're well produced the sweetness is usually a bit more balanced than in the Irish whiskies I've tried.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If one was a connoisseur I'd imagine they'd be able to differentiate an Irish from a Scottish whisky a majority, but probably not 100%, of the time. But if someone was a beginner they'd most definitely have trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So to answer your question more directly, if you were to showcase whisky, I would argue that you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do so with product coming out of Ireland, but that it would probably be more on par quality wise with American whisky, than it would Scottish.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Aged Whiskey has gone through the majority of its chemical changes during barrel aging. It has been oxidized and condensed. The final product is generally stable, however further evaporation of liquids will occur over time just as in the barrel aging process, so storage in airtight containers would be recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sunlight has been known to increase the amount of substances like hydroxymethlyfurfurals in stored alcoholic beverages like mead and wine. I have not read any studies in direct correlation with whiskey, but with residual sugar present the production seems likely, thus storage in darkness, or non-UV light would also likely be a positive for long term storage.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Whiskey's shelf stability, especially if sealed, will bypass that of wine providing one of the most harsh environments for any sort of spoilage organism to take hold, with it's high ethanol content, as well as being more acidic than many more neutral liquors such as vodka.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For blended whisky, the age is not generally considered a relevant factor. There will be a range of ages and whiskies in there, chosen to make the end result. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Unless a particular blend has ages specified (the Grant's Family Reserve doesn't), all you can guarantee is that the youngest whisky is 3 years old. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As an example, another Grant's whisky, the 12 year old, has whiskies that are 12 years old and older blended into it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a fan of haggis and single-malt Scotch, and host of many a Rabbie Burns night, I'd say you have several good alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most of the Burns nights I've attended offered malty, full-bodied beers along with the haggis. Scottish ales, porters, wee heavies, and oatmeal stouts are some of the favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If there are wines, I'd recommend hearty reds, like a good Zinfandel.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that not all haggis is created equal. Just as no two Texans have the same family recipe for chili, no two Scots will make haggis the same. I've had haggis all over Scotland and quite a few places in the U.S., and each one is different. If you're getting it from a butcher that regularly makes haggis, ask for a taste in advance so you can ponder what to pair with it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE: Haggis in a can is an abomination.&lt;/strong&gt; Don't do it! Get fresh-made haggis from a proper butcher shop. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Having had (and enjoyed) Haggis many times, and I think it being closer to a red meat than a white meat, I'd say you'd want to pair it with alcohol that is typically served with red meat. Full bodied, medium to dry red wines, or darker bitter ales.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm not usually one to go 'by the book' with my pairings, but knowing what I know about the flavour and texture of haggis I think red wine or dark beer would be the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you like Aberlour you will probably enjoy other Speysides, some well know brands are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Glenfiddich&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Glenmorangie&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Glenfarclas&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The Balvenie&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Dalwhinnie&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The Glenlivet&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Glen Moray&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;They vary in price and each brand has different years which will obviusly effect the price. Of the above the Glenlivet Founders Reserve and Glen Maray Classic tend to be on the cheaper end of the scale.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can also pick up some really great whisky that isn't from a well known brand, for example here in the UK we have a discount chain Lidl which does a really great Speyside that is really cheap: &lt;a href="https://whiskeybon.com/scotch/lidl-ben-bracken-speyside-review/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Lidl Ben Bracken Speyside Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Will alcohol boost body fat?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That will depend on several things, such as the type of booze you drink, the amount you drink, the amount you eat and the amount of exercise you do daily.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink responsibly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Alcohol can either give you a beer belly or help you uncover your abs. After all, while one Archives of Internal Medicine study shows that people who put back one or two drinks a day are less likely to gain weight, research in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition shows that men consume an extra 433 calories on days they have just a couple of drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;While lowered inhibitions and drink-fueled munchies have something to do with it, 61 percent of the caloric increase comes from the alcohol itself. So, if you're trying to lose weight while still enjoying the occasional drink, you'd better be wise about which drinks you choose. Here are the best and worst booze you can order.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Wine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Red or white, you can expect to consume roughly 100 to 120 calories per glass. (That's assuming, however, that you're drinking a standardized 5-ounce glass. Research from Iowa State and Cornell shows that people tend to over-pour by 12 percent.)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;However, there are some considerations to make when picking grapes: White wine typically contains fewer carbohydrates than does red wine, which makes a small difference in terms of calories, says Caroline Cederquist, M.D., author of The MD Factor and creator of bistroMD. Meanwhile, red wine is richer in antioxidants, and a 2014 study in The Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, red wine's ellargic acids delay the growth of fat cells while slowing the development of new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vermouth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;"A fortified wine with higher alcohol content and infused spices and herbs, vermouth is a calorie saver if you have it by itself—as it's commonly served in Europe," says Georgie Fear, R.D., author ofLean Habits for Lifelong Weight Loss. A 1.5-ounce serving contains a mere 64 calories, and typically contains about 15 to 18 percent alcohol, she says. Plus, research out of Budapest shows that it's jam-packed with polyphenol compounds, which may promote healthy weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Still, remember that if you mix it into a Manhattan or martini, you're probably going to be consuming far more calories and sugar, Fear says.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Straight Liquors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;When it comes to getting the most alcohol for the fewest calories, shots and straight booze are the way to go. "There is not much of a difference 80-proof hard liquors," Cederquist says. "They all have around the same number of calories and carbohydrates." And as calories increase along with the alcohol content, the difference is not huge. For instance, a shot of 86-proof whiskey contains 105 calories and a shot of 80-proof vodka contains 97 calories.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;However, you also need to keep in mind that the sweeter the liquor, the more calories it typically contains, she says. "If you're looking for a lower calorie alternative, avoid the flavored vodkas and spiced rums and go for the original or 'plain' option offered," she says. "If you are looking for a flavor boost, try low-calorie mixers like a flavored seltzer or fresh squeezed lemon or lime. This will provide the taste without the calories."&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light Beers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;With fewer calories and carbs, these are the best brewskis for weight loss, Cederquist says. Many light beers contain 90 to 100 calories per 12 ounces, while extra-light beers pack about 55 to 65.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;However, just don't use that as an excuse to have more beers than you typically would, or you'll undo all benefits. Hey, they generally pack less alcohol, right? Well, yeah, but they actually tend to have a higher percentage of their calories coming from alcohol compared to standard brews. Budweiser Select 55 for example derives 88.2 percent of its calories from alcohol, compared to Bud Light at 74.1 percent, and regular Budweiser at 66.9 percent calories, Fear says.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Worst&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Sugar-Packed Cocktails&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;"Margaritas and Long Island Iced Teas can set you back more calories than a large order of McDonald's French Fries," Fear says. Even worse, calories from sugar-laden drinks come as a sneak attack. When you drink a marg, your body is so overwhelmed with the alcohol content that your body doesn't properly metabolize the sugar. Instead, it stores the sweet stuff as fat.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;There is never a good excuse to drink these and other sugar-filled cocktails especially if you are trying to lose weight or not develop diabetes, she says. Now, if you've got a skilled mixologist behind your bar, you're probably calorically safe ordering a cocktail. After all, he'd never serve up one of these artless offenses.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;High-Alcohol Craft Beers&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;"The last five years have seen an explosion of craft breweries creating high-alcohol varieties, which pack more calories per bottle than you may realize," Fear says. Remember, more alcohol means more calories. Every gram of the good stuff contains seven calories.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;For instance, Flying Dog Horn Dog, which contains 10.2 percent alcohol by volume, also contains 314 calories per bottle, and Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA boasts 18 percent alcohol by volume, but also packs 450 calories into each bottle. That's a meal in a glass. Unfortunately, though, all that alcohol can wind up making you hungrier. - &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/the-best-and-worst-booze-for-weight-loss" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Best and Worst Booze to Drink if You Want to Lose Weight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think there are two ways to look at this. &lt;a href="https://www.whisky-news.com/En/reports/Labels.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Some distilleries do put the date&lt;/a&gt; when they bottled the whisky/scotch it will just take some leg work. Even cheap Old Turkey has a bottled date &lt;a href="https://whiskeyid.com/how-to-date-id-your-whiskey/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;stamped on the label&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Then the other way is to do some reverse math. There is such a thing as vintage whisky. Distilled and put into barrels in say 1990 and aged 25 years. So it would be bottled in the year 2015. Obviously you might have to wait until they bottle it the year someone is born. You can see some of this at the G&lt;a href="https://www.glenfiddich.com/us/collection/product-collection/rare-and-vintage/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;lenfiddich website&lt;/a&gt; (unfortunately they have an "are you old enough question" to get past). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The last option is to just buy a bottle of 20 year old whisky the year someone turns 20 (or whatever year you want) and just give it to them then when it's released by the distillery. Holding on to a bottle for 20 years or so can leave it vulnerable to all types of accidents. Don't risk it and just buy the bottle when they turn 21 or whatever age you want to bestow it upon them.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Just to extend farmersteves answer...There are quite a few that produce limited releases annually.  These tend to be limited releases produced either by a new brand or established distilleries but they are usually limited to smaller cask numbers.  As they are limited I would expect you to have to pay a bit more, many sell out quickly from shops so you may have to use an Online Auction.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The following auction is highly regarded and this search (simply for the year 2018) will contain many of this years release.  Note in these cases 2018 is the year it was bottled, the age determined by when the cask was put down.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.whiskyauctioneer.com/auction-search?terms=2018&amp;amp;dsp=Previous&amp;amp;show_page=20&amp;amp;sort_by=d_DESC&amp;amp;op=SEARCH&amp;amp;form_build_id=&amp;amp;form_id=auction_form" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="Whisky Auctioneer 2018 search"&gt;Whisky Auctioneer search for 2018 whiskies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Just yesterday MacAllan released one limited to a few hundred but very difficult to get and managed very poorly by them if I say so myself...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finally. I am also aware some distilleries let you buy casks to bottle at a later date, or alternatively buy a bottle from a yet to be bottled cask.  If you do it this year you could request the bottling at a specific milestone for your child (I know people who have done this).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I just looked at several of my bottles, and the only one having a date on the bottle was Ardbeg and it was stamped on the bottle not on the label.  You should look at smaller distilleries as they would use it as a marketing gimmick.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;An alternative would be to buy a bottle of Laphroaig which allows you to register a square foot plot of land at the distillery and get a certificate for it, which includes the date of registration.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you expand your horizons, many bourbon distilleries in the US either batch or date their bottles by hand.  Bean-ball Bourbon from Cooperstown does, others such as Hillrock give a batch number, and Hudson Valley also does batch numbers by hand.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I agree with most of the comments above, especially about Ralfy on youtube.  Also via &lt;a href="http://ralfy.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://ralfy.com/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have seen Erdradour in the US, but not the Caledonia.  I got my bottle in Pilochry at the distillery.  Great tour, worth the trip if you are in the Highlands.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Other than taking a gamble once in a while, find the ambassador of the brand, and see what events they have in a larger city near you, and make the trip.  Another option is to look at some of the social organizations near you.  Some of them have fund raisers that include tastings of several brands.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've seen several scotches that are labeled "From the harvest of..." a particular year, if you want the birth year to correspond to the production year.  I got my kids vintage ports since they 1) age well nearly indefinitely if properly stored, and 2) everybody can tolerate a little glass of port even if they don't like alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bourbon and scotch are types of whiskey and cognac is a variety of brandy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Bourbon is a type of whiskey, whereas not all whiskies are bourbons! The main difference between scotch and whisky is geographic: they are made in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bourbon is a type of whiskey, whereas not all whiskies are bourbons!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.diffen.com/difference/Bourbon_vs_Whiskey" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Bourbon&lt;/a&gt; is a type of whiskey that gets its name from Bourbon County, Kentucky, where it originated. Bourbon tends to be amber-colored, and a little sweeter and heavier in texture than other whiskeys.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Scotch?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The main difference between &lt;a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/30278/what%E2%80%99s-difference-between-scotch-whiskey-and-bourbon" rel="noreferrer"&gt;scotch&lt;/a&gt; and whisky is geographic, but also ingredients and spellings. Scotch is whisky made in Scotland, while bourbon is whiskey made in the U.S.A, generally Kentucky. Scotch is made mostly from malted barley, while bourbon is distilled from corn. If you’re in England and ask for a whisky, you’ll get Scotch. But in Ireland, you’ll get Irish whiskey (yep, they spell it differently for a little colour).&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are whiskeys?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Whisky or whiskey is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash. Various grains (which may be malted) are used for different varieties, including barley, corn (maize), rye, and wheat. Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks, generally made of charred white oak. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Whisky is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types. The typical unifying characteristics of the different classes and types are the fermentation of grains, distillation, and aging in wooden barrels. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Whisky (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brandies&lt;/strong&gt; are not whiskeys, but is a spirit produced by distilling &lt;strong&gt;wine&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Brandy is a spirit produced by distilling wine. Brandy generally contains 35–60% alcohol by volume (70–120 US proof) and is typically drunk as an after-dinner digestif. Some brandies are aged in wooden casks, others are coloured with caramel colouring to imitate the effect of aging, and some are produced using a combination of both aging and colouring. Varieties of wine brandy can be found across the winemaking world. Among the most renowned are Cognac and Armagnac from southwestern France. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandy" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Brandy (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Cognac?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Cognac is a variety of brandy named after the town of Cognac, France. It is produced in the surrounding wine-growing region in the departments of Charente and Charente-Maritime. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Cognac production falls under French Appellation d'origine contrôlée designation, with production methods and naming required to meet certain legal requirements. Among the specified grapes Ugni blanc, known locally as Saint-Emilion, is most widely used.&lt;a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/30278/what%E2%80%99s-difference-between-scotch-whiskey-and-bourbon" rel="noreferrer"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; The brandy must be twice distilled in copper pot stills and aged at least two years in French oak barrels from Limousin or Tronçais. Cognac matures in the same way as whiskies and wine barrel age, and most cognacs spend considerably longer "on the wood" than the minimum legal requirement. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The white wine used in making cognac is very dry, acidic and thin. Though it has been characterized as "virtually undrinkable",&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandy" rel="noreferrer"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; it is excellent for distillation and aging. It may be made only from a strict list of grape varieties. In order for it to be considered a true cru, the wine must be at least 90% Ugni blanc (known in Italy as Trebbiano), Folle blanche and Colombard, while up to 10% of the grapes used can be Folignan, Jurançon blanc, Meslier St-François (also called Blanc Ramé), Sélect, Montils or Sémillon.&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armagnac_(brandy)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; Cognacs which are not to carry the name of a cru are freer in the allowed grape varieties, needing at least 90% Colombard, Folle blanche, Jurançon blanc, Meslier Saint-François, Montils, Sémillon, or Ugni blanc, and up to 10% Folignan or Sélect. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognac" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Cognac (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Armagnac brandy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Armagnac is a distinctive kind of brandy produced in the Armagnac region in Gascony, southwest France. It is distilled from wine usually made from a blend of grapes including Baco 22A, Colombard, Folle blanche and Ugni blanc, traditionally using column stills rather than the pot stills used in the production of cognac. The resulting spirit is then aged in oak barrels before release. Production is overseen by the Institut national de l'origine et de la qualité (INAO) and the Bureau National Interprofessionel de l'Armagnac (BNIA). - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armagnac_(brandy)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Armagnac (brandy)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One last note. There also exists a liquor that is generally known as &lt;strong&gt;fruit brandy&lt;/strong&gt; and is quite popular in various regions around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_brandy" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Fruit brandy&lt;/a&gt; or fruit spirit&lt;a href="https://www.diffen.com/difference/Bourbon_vs_Whiskey" rel="noreferrer"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; is a distilled beverage produced from mash, juice, wine or residues of culinary fruits. The term covers a broad class of spirits produced across the world, and typically excludes beverages made from grapes, which are referred to as plain brandy (when made from distillation from wine) or pomace brandy (when made directly from grape pomace). Apples, pears, apricots, plums and cherries are the most commonly used fruits. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;According to a legal definition in the United States, a "fruit brandy" is distilled "solely from the fermented juice or mash of whole, sound, ripe fruit, or from standard grape, citrus, or other fruit wine, with or without the addition of not more than 20 percent by weight of the pomace of such juice or wine, or 30 percent by volume of the lees of such wine, or both."&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;In the European Union, fruit brandies may not be labeled as "fruit brandy"; instead, the legal English denomination is fruit spirit, which is "produced exclusively by the alcoholic fermentation and distillation of fleshy fruit or must of such fruit, berries or vegetables, with or without stones".&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandy" rel="noreferrer"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; A great number of European fruit brandies have a protected designation of origin, and are labeled with their respective protected names instead of "fruit spirit" ("apricot spirit", etc.). Cider spirit and perry spirit (fruit brandy distilled from cider or perry) form a separate legal category. Some fruit spirits may be labeled with alternative names such as kirsch (cherry spirit) or slivovitz (plum spirit) regardless their country of origin.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;In British usage, "fruit brandy" may also refer to liqueurs obtained by maceration of whole fruits, juice or flavoring in a distilled beverage, and such liqueurs are legally labeled as "cherry brandy", "apricot brandy" etc. all across the European Union.&lt;a href="https://www.diffen.com/difference/Bourbon_vs_Whiskey" rel="noreferrer"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; Such beverages are used similar to cordials, and as an ingredient in cocktails and cakes. Fruit brandies obtained by distillation are often referred by the French term eau de vie.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Fruit brandy usually contains 40% to 45% ABV (80 to 90 US proof). It is often colourless. Fruit brandy is customarily drunk chilled or over ice, but is occasionally mixed. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The answer above nails the quantitative parts of the question, but I'll spend a little time adding a qualitative answer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In terms of flavour and the experience while drinking, Brandy and Whisky are quite similar. If you gave a taste test to a beginner they could easily mistake one for the other.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;At the same time, though, someone who was well versed in both liquors could likely distinguish between the two a majority of the time. While there are whiskies out there which border on cloying, brandy usually tends to be sweeter than most whiskies.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, the flavour profiles for whisky are also much broader. That is, you're likely to see much more variation in the qualitative aspects of whisky than you are brandy.&lt;/p&gt;
