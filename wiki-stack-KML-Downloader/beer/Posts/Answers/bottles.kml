					&lt;h2&gt;tl;dr&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Tapping the top causes compression waves started through the air in the opening (which is why it only works from the top.) The compression waves bounce at the bottom and become expansion waves. The compression and expansion causes agitation which foams up the beer. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Tell me more...&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The layman's summary from &lt;a href="http://gizmodo.com/the-fascinating-science-behind-why-a-tapped-beer-foams-1451022759/1451360561/@jesusdiaz"&gt;Scientists discover why beer bottles overflow after a sudden impact&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;A lot happens in the short period of time between tap and torrent. The
					  moment some jerk clocks your bottle's mouth, a compression wave
					  travels down through the glass. When the wave hits bottom, it's
					  reflected as an expansion wave that travels through the beer. These
					  waves keep bouncing back and forth, with the compression waves
					  breaking up the CO2 bubbles in your beer into thousands of incredibly
					  tiny microbubbles, and the expansion waves causing those microbubbles
					  to violently expand into skyrocketing plumes.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The result? Millions and millions of expanding CO2 bubbles turn your
					  beer into foam shooting out of your bottle. With any luck, it spills
					  all over your jerk friend's pants.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The abstract from the &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3747"&gt;published article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;A sudden vertical impact on the mouth of a beer bottle generates a
					  compression wave that propagates through the glass towards the bottom.
					  When this wave reaches the base of the bottle, it is transmitted to
					  the liquid as an expansion wave that travels to free surface, where it
					  bounces back as a compression wave. This train of
					  expansion-compression waves drives the forced cavitation of existing
					  air pockets, leading to their violent collapse. A cloud of very small
					  daughter bubbles are generated upon these collapses, that expand much
					  faster than their mothers due to their smaller size. These rapidly
					  growing bubble clusters effectively act as buoyancy sources, what
					  leads to the formation of bubble-laden plumes whose void fraction
					  increases quickly by several orders of magnitude, eventually turning
					  most of the liquid into foam.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Fully attributing &lt;a href="http://www.berghoffbeer.com/blog/"&gt;the Berghoff Beer Blog&lt;/a&gt; for this interesting story (emphasis mine),&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Around World War II, brown glass rose in demand and many companies had to forfeit their brown glass for their country. Unfortunately that meant companies with higher quality beers had to use clear glass, which made their beers look like cheaper, clear glass beers. Higher quality brewers’ solution was to sell their beer in green bottles so a consumer could tell the difference between a regular beer and a higher quality. &lt;strong&gt;The green beer bottle became a status symbol for many European breweries.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;These days, there’s not much of a reason to sell a beer in a green bottle other than for marketing and aesthetic. Many companies use it to distinguish their beer from others. Of course, some beers have used green bottles for so long, it would seem silly to switch to a brown glass now.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucky for us, glass suppliers are able to apply clear, UV protected coats to glass that help keep beer fresh no matter what kind of bottle it is in.&lt;/strong&gt; [...]&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.berghoffbeer.com/blog/what-does-the-color-of-your-beer-bottle-mean/"&gt;http://www.berghoffbeer.com/blog/what-does-the-color-of-your-beer-bottle-mean/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, perhaps it's no longer the case that clear and green bottles are (noticeably) inferior to brown bottles!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Edit: I failed to find historical sources for the above claims, even some indication of higher demand for brown glass during World War II. However, the story seems widely believed today, true or not.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would expect that companies which use clear bottles don't expect their product to see that much sunlight, or that they think their customers won't notice a little skunking if it does see any.  Anecdotally, I typically associate clear bottles with the larger brewers (Coors, Budweiser), and I don't think of those beers as having much in the way of hops, the source of the isohumulones which, when combined with light, create the "skunk".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_bottle#Lightstruck_beer" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; points out something interesting as well:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;In some cases, such as Miller High Life, a hop extract that does not
					  have isohumulones is used to bitter the beer so it cannot be
					  'lightstruck'.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is an incomplete answer, but I know that there are some smaller bottles of "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_ale" rel="nofollow"&gt;old ale&lt;/a&gt;" beers which are made for aging.  In particular, there are several from the UK which are sold in the 200-300mL range, such as &lt;a href="http://draftmag.com/cellar/uncapped-44-25-and-4-year-old-thomas-hardys-ale/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Thomas Hardy&lt;/a&gt;'s.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm afraid that I can't tell you anything about the effect (or non-effect) of bottle size.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not really.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt;, larger bottles mean that the little bit of air trapped at the top of the bottle is smaller compared to the volume of beer than it would be in a standard 12 oz bottle.  However, I've been unable to find any research backing this up, and anecdotally it makes no difference.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Larger bottles are favored for aging beers mostly for practical reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Stores are more willing to sell a single large bottle (whereas many often require the purchase of an entire six-pack for smaller beers)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;It's easier to share a large bottle, which you often want to do with a good beer you're aging&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;They're often (but not always) cheaper than the equivalent beer split up between several smaller bottles.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But taste and aging-wise, there's no benefit to larger bottles.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No for the cans; maybe for the contents.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While it's hard to predict the future, we can infer from the past.  As it stands, beer cans as old as 40 years are pretty much worthless (with a few exceptions).  This is because right around the mid 70s, beer can collection as an activity exploded.  Beer cans before that point became valuable, but beer cans from after that point were heavily collected (up through the present day), and are therefore pretty low value.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;TLDR: There exist too many well-preserved beer cans from the current era for them to be worth anything in the next 20 years at least (and probably well through the next 40-60 years).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That's just the cans, though.  Exceptions might be very specific beers known to be age-able for decades.  Unfortunately, most beers just don't age that long.  Even a hearty barely wine usually peaks, at most, after a couple years.  The Stone Vertical Epic 020202 series was meant to be aged 10 years, which is unusually long for a beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you could find a beer you reasonably believed would improve over the course of several decades, you might be able to get some money out of it if it were stored properly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not likely, unless there are some rare beers in there that benefit from aging and are kept in the right conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most beers will oxidize over time, even with a sealed cork or cap a minute amount of oxygen can permeate the seal, over the course of 20 years this could damage the beer.  Some companies may wax dip their beers as well, in many cases wax dipping is more for aesthetics but can also help minimize oxygen exchange for periods of long storage.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Only certains beers are suited for aging, such as some lambics, saisons, Belgian quads, and high ABV stouts and barleywines, to name a few.  Even for some of these it may be noted to cellar for no more than 3-5 years.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For long term aging you also need to maintain temperatures in the range of 55°F.  This temperature should be held consistently with any major swings up or down being avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Outside of this you would need to have beers that are rare and highly sought after today to have even a chance of them being valuable in the future.  Even if you picked out 20 of the most sought after beers today it's important to remember tastes change and they may not be sought after in 20 years.  Just look at the changes the American craft beer environment has gone through in 20 years!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can decant the beer between two large glasses or pitchers - the agitation will cause the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to come out of solution quickly and also not raise the temperature too much. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sample after 4-5 decants to see how much the carbonation has dropped, and repeat as necessary. You will end up with quite a bit of foam, hence the need for larger glasses or a pitcher.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;How long do you leave them in the fridge before you open them?  Making sure they've had a good several hours to chill may mitigate the explosion.  You could also try a homebrewer's trick, which is to chill them really cold, pop the caps all off then put new caps on.  You would need a &lt;a href="http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/brewing/brewing-equipment/bottling/bottle-cappers/red-baron-emily-capper.html"&gt;bottle capper&lt;/a&gt; to do this.  They're fairly cheap but you probably wouldn't have them unless you were or knew a homebrewer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, your best course of action may actually be to contact Hitachino.  Gushing bottles are often a sign of a wild yeast infection, so it's possible you may have just gotten some bad beer that got mishandled in shipping or something messed up on the bottling line and they missed it.  They may replace the pack or at least give you some other cool stuff to make up for the mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Certain wavelengths of light are responsible for skunking beer. I believe these are mostly in the blue and ultraviolet parts of the spectrum. Brown bottles do the best at blocking out the UV rays. This is why you can get an occasional Rolling Rock that tastes off. I've never heard of a UV reflective coating before, but it makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What follows is probably only relevant if you want to be nit-picky about this:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If it is not in direct sunlight, I'd say your pretty ok. I don't know what your lighting situation is, but I know most incandescent bulbs mostly give off infrared light (I'm not sure if infrared light has been correlated to skunking) and the modern CFL bulbs mostly give off light in the visible spectrum. I'd say both however give off some sort of UV light.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are really concerned, you could tint the cupboard glass. Vehicle window tint is designed to block out UV rays that can damage the interior of cars. Your level of protection depends on how dark you want your tint. If you want the highest protection though, I'd recommend a wooden cupboard.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Over-carbonation is typically a sign of infection, which is certainly a possibility.  It's not a problem I've had with Hitachino, but at their price point I don't drink them often&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Go to the store and get Bitburger german pilsner in a can, and in a bottle.  Tell me if you taste a difference.  I tried that and the canned stuff is a heck of a lot better tasting than the skunked stuff in the brown glass bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The chances of contamination at a Japanese brewery are very low.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Japanese tend to drink their beer much colder than craft beer drinkers in the United States - Think Coors cold.  We suggest placing the beer in the freezer for 3-5 minutes before opening the bottle, leaving it undisturbed and pouring it into an over-sized nonic glass. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hitachino's beers when stored and poured correctly are quite good, but buying them in the United States after a trans-pacific journey is both expensive and less tasty than on tap.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think for short term storage it shouldn't be a problem. It sounds like you're just keeping the bottles in the cupboard outside their cardboard carriers? You could always use the carriers or keep most in carriers in the back and single bottles in the front if you enjoy the appearance of the bottles. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Samuel Adams' carriers are taller for the exact reason of keeping out light, and they use brown bottles so obviously even with brown bottles light is still of some concern.
					&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					I've usually had a problem with beer tasting off if it goes from a refrigerated state to room temperature and then back in the fridge. I've noticed this happens to me more frequently than anything with light.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;No. They are not sufficient, but are one of several necessary conditions to keep beer from going bad. In general, keep beer at a cool temperature (50-60 degrees), away from light, and stand the bottle up (do not lie them sideways like wine bottles are stored). Brown bottles help keep beer away from light, but as a rule of them, store your beer someplace dark. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Draft beer does not give you a hangover, headache, or any kind of sickness just because it is a draft beer. If you’ve ever felt sick after drinking draft beer, you either:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Had too much&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Drank from a dirty tap.&lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Any alcoholic drink will cause a hangouver if you drink too much. Bottled beer and draft beer are basically the same product, they should produce the same hangover.
					But it's easier to drink too much of draft beer as they are typically served in larger volumes. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The exception are darker beverages (like wine and cognac), they produce worse hangovers because part of their alcohol is in worser forms to your body then ethanol. I am not aware of any beer containing it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Glass vs bottle or can will be a pretty noticeable difference with most styles of beer simply due to the size of the opening.  When you pour from the storage vessel to the glass you disturb the beer a lot which drives CO2 gas out, and that takes a lot of aromatics with it so the aroma you get from the beer in a glass is WAY stronger and more complex than what you'd sniff from the bottle or can.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also smell is a pretty huge part of tasting something and when you drink from a glass you're putting your nose right into the thick of all that, so the flavor will be more intense as well.  Bottles and cans sort of keep that toned down since you don't smell the beer as much.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There used to be a prejudice against cans because the liquid and the aluminum would react and oxidize, but they started coating the insides with a food safe epoxy resin decades ago and it's completely sealed now.  As far as taste goes there's no difference between the two, but cans actually store a bit better because they let in no light and no air while bottles will eventually let through enough to affect the beer.  Brewers like cans as well since they're more portable, don't shatter, chill faster, and are often cheaper to fill.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The process is a bit different in freely moving bottles when compared to bottles on a solid surface.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Bottles that can't move only foam a little bit, where the hitting bottle foams as much as the hit bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Bottles that can move (even 1 mm is enough) move down faster than the beer. This creates a lower pressure inside the bottle. 
					Beer can hold a lot less CO2 at lower pressure so any bubble that can grow, will grow and new ones will form at an increased rate.
					The top bottle will have an equal but opposite pressure change, but increased pressure just increases the amount of CO2 that the beer can hold so no extra foam will be produced here.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Fun sidenote: If you hit hard enough the pressure in the hit bottle gets low enough to create a small and very short lived vacuum at the bottom of the bottle, the beer rushes towards the vacuum with such power that the bottom of the bottle breaks off. You can also do this with your hand instead of with another bottle. &lt;a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Break-a-Beer-Bottle-With-Your-Bare-Hands" rel="nofollow"&gt;How to Break a Beer Bottle With Your Bare Hands&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would add that beer that tends to last longer in a can because of way it's sealed.  No bottle cap for leaking oxygen and light can't penetrate so it's not going to be ruined as fast when it's sitting in the store fridge under the fluorescent lights&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The cage is simply twisted closed.   You'll see that bottom wire is twisted tight and bent upwards.   Simply bend it back down to horizontal, and untwist to loosen the cage.  At that point you'll be able to lift the cage free, and un-cork by hand.  It's been a year or two since I've had a bottle of Delirium Tremens, so I don't remember how tight the cork was, but certainly some beers that are corked and capped like this do have corks that are fairly resistant to removal.  If that is the case for your bottle, then I find that twisting the cork as I pull up will generally free it nicely.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I cannot recall delirium ever being packaged in a strange way the site (in dutch) also only shows Deliria packaged the way you describe. In either way i think they should be opened like a bottle of champagne, open the metal wire casing twist the cork out (or push it with your thumb) and it's often advised to wrap your hand around the neck of the bottle which will make it less eager to foam excessively. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here you have some pictures to take a look at: &lt;a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Champagne-Bottle" rel="nofollow"&gt;How to Open a Champagne Bottle&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I just went through four Hitachinos, and I can say for sure - they are solidly carbonated, but nothing I would call undrinkable. I've definitely had - and enjoyed - more carbonated beers. I've also had them before (bottle and poured at a bar) and never had the overcarbonation problem you describe.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Headaches from draft beer could be caused by a sensitivity to tyramine. People with this food and beverage allergy should be aware of the consequences of what happens when consuming foods high in tyramine. HealthLine explains why you may have to say no to draft beer:
