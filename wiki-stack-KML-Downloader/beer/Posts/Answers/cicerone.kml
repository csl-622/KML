					&lt;p&gt;Basically, they are experts in beer. They are knowledgeable in everything from the brewing process and the beer styles to properly serving beer and how to pair it with food. Yes, there are certification programs around, such as &lt;a href="http://www.cicerone.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not sure about training, but it seems like it involves a series of exams, much like actuarial exams or the FE and PE for engineers. &lt;a href="http://www.craftbeer.com/craft-beer-muses/beer-experts-and-cicerone" rel="nofollow"&gt;craftbeer.com has a great article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oz_Clarke" rel="nofollow"&gt;Oz Clarke&lt;/a&gt;, you should burp the beer (to judge the hops).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;See this clip from Oz &amp;amp; James Drink to Britain (episode 1, starting at about 2:28):&lt;br&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/101/taste/"&gt;Beer Advocate's Guide&lt;/a&gt; is a decent one.  The abridged version is:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Look at the beer.  How's the color and head?&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Swirl it a little bit to pull out the aroma&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Smell it.  Swirl again if need be.  I recommend taking a 20 second break after smelling, then smelling again, since if you smell too long, your nose gets used to it and it becomes harder to pick up the notes.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Sip it.  Don't swallow immediately, but keep it on your tongue for a moment.  Breath out with it still in your mouth and pay attention to the resulting smell (unless you just ate a bunch of garlic before the beer).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Taste again as the beer warms up a bit.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Just like there is no standards for understanding Computer Science education there is no standardized wine or beer education. You get the education where you can. I have pretty extensive experience in both wine and beer education. At one time, long ago, I was a BJCP certified judge. I have a winemaking certificate from UC Davis (short course) Both were a rigorous education. Then I went on to start a winery and eventually taught at a local community college that has a 2 year wine program. I think only the lead instructor had anything like a masters in wine (MW) the rest of us just university classes and self taught.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Getting a degree in brewing from an accredited college like UC Davis would have the most clout. I wouldn't say the WSET is universally accepted as the "gold standard" in wine education. If all you want to do is get some type of certificate for being a server then the Cicerone or BJCP will probably serve the purpose. Getting a &lt;a href="https://www.cicerone.org/us-en/certifications/master-cicerone" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Master Cicerone&lt;/a&gt; would probably be the highest for beer. Beer education has always been less formal than winemaking. I'm not sure why since brewing beer is way more complicated than making wine. I'm sure it has to do with the snobbery associated with wine vs. the everyman appeal associated with beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As stated, the BJCP certifications, as well as the Certified Cicerone(r) are the most universally recognized across the craft beer industry.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are many brewing degrees available as well, ranging from certificates to advanced vocational trades and brewmaster educations more common in countries that treat brewing as a tradeskill.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It depends on your industry focus, BJCP is most focused on homebrewing, judging homebrewing, and the historical preservation and relevence of beer styles.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Cicerone program is concerned with a well rounded understanding of beer, draft line systems and maintenance, and service. It's suited for primarily industry professionals in a front-of-house role, sales representatives, or Brewers honing their sensory evaluation. The Cicerone program uses the BJCP guidelines for style recognition.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Degrees are usually for production Brewers, lab technicians wishing to specialize in beer quality assurance, or sales personnel looking to further their depth of knowledge in regard to the brewing process. Every school will be slightly different, and may be taught according to a general regional style of brewing, (German, English, Belgian), and will differ in style of brewing as well as elective material, but will usually cover the science in regard to wort production and fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And finally, brewing itself can often be a heavy amount of on the job training, with some of the most knowledgeable brewers never having a formal certification, but just a wealth of work experience.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is nothing entirely universal or recognized as a complete education at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
