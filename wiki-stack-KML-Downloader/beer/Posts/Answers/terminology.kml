					&lt;p&gt;There are a few theories out there, and their veracity, like that of most historical "facts", is hotly debated.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One theory begins in 1722 when Ralph Harwood, a London brewer, created a beer called &lt;em&gt;Entire&lt;/em&gt;.  For some time, working folk had been drinking a blend of beer, ale, and strong beer, which pubs would mix to balance out their stocks and maintain acceptable flavor.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entire&lt;/em&gt; was a pre-mixed version, brewed by Hardwood then sold and delivered to pubs.  Prior to this point, each pub had mixed their own.  In addition to economies of scale, Harwood's method allowed for aging of the finished product.  Historians theorize that the name &lt;em&gt;porter&lt;/em&gt; came about because of the porters who worked at the markets and delivered the final product to the pubs.  A variation of this theory suggests that &lt;em&gt;porter&lt;/em&gt; simply refers to the working class occupations of those who drank the concoction.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another theory suggests that &lt;em&gt;porter&lt;/em&gt; comes from the Netherlands, where a beer called &lt;em&gt;poorter&lt;/em&gt; was being made as early as the 1300s.  The Dutch were prolific traders, and cultural transfer could easily have occurred.  The term &lt;em&gt;poorter&lt;/em&gt; originally concerned inhabitants of walled cities and may also have been related to social station.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some of the mocelues in the beer are broken down by ultraviolet  light and bind to sulfur atoms. This causes Skunking. This is why some bottle six packs have a tall sleeve and beer keeps longer in a darker colored bottle. A common misperception is warming and cooling over and over again causes Skunking.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Skunking is a stage in a beer's life in which it goes rancid. It may smell funny, almost like a skunk, and taste bad. As John pointed out, it is generally caused by excess exposure to light. Beers packaged in clear (Corona and Land Shark for instance) or green bottles are particularly susceptible to this. It is best to avoid these kinds of beers to avoid the risk of skunked beer; choose beer bottled in brown bottles or cans, which are less susceptible to light exposure. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It doesn't actually mean anything; or at least, it almost never means the same thing twice, and doesn't refer to any &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; common style or process. It's about as meaningful as the fact that several dozen breweries have a beer they label as "Select".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For example, in the case of Molson Export, the story goes that it was deemed so high quality that it was "good enough to send overseas" - and, implicitly, better than competing &lt;em&gt;imported&lt;/em&gt; brands.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One common usage is for a line with slightly higher ABV (it keeps better in shipment!) or tailored to suit the ABC laws of other jurisdictions to which it might be shipped. But there isn't any single meaning that's widely understood. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;All malt beer is made entirely from mashed barley malt and without the addition of adjuncts, sugars or additional fermentables.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From an expert of a widely known brand beer producer in my country (Turkey), beers here must be at least 60% malt (This may be different in other countries). The rest are adjuncts, like sugar or corn or rice etc. Using adjuncts is also for decreasing the cost or to lighten the color of beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Draft beer&lt;/code&gt; is another name for &lt;code&gt;Draught beer&lt;/code&gt;, it means that the beer is served from a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cask_ale"&gt;cask&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keg"&gt;keg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When you see this term plastered on beer cans, then it means that it's a &lt;code&gt;Canned Draught&lt;/code&gt;.   The can contains a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget_%28beer%29"&gt;widget&lt;/a&gt;. This widget was invented by Guinness in order to let consumers drink a &lt;code&gt;Draught beer&lt;/code&gt; at home. This differs from a typical can in that the beer is usually carbonated by forcing CO2 directly into the bottle/can or intermediary vessel, or by "bottle conditioning" (leaving live yeast in the beer and adding something for it to eat, creating CO2 and more alcohol).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Everyone on this site should be thankful for Guinness for having invented the widget!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Trappist beers are all abbey beers, but not all abbey beers are trappist. It's a bit like champagne, it's a protected product name to designate a certain type of classical brewn beers.Trappist is the enumeration of beers brew within the walls of an abbey inhabitted by the Trappist monks of the Tre Fontane. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Currently (Okt. 2015) there are 11 recognized trappists, of which 10 are actively producing: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Six Belgian trappists:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Chimay &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Orval&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Westmalle&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Westvleteren (St. Sixtus)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Achel (St.  Benedictus of the Achelse kluis)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Rochefort&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Netherlands:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;La Trappe (Brouwerij de Koningshoeven)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Zundert (Brouwerij Abdij Maria Toevlucht)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Austria: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Stift Engelszell&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Italy:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Tre Fontane Abbey&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;United States of America:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Spencer&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There's also one aspiring Trappist brewery in the US named St. Joseph’s Abbey.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are some strict rules to obtain "Authentic Trappiste Product":&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The beer must be brewed within the walls of a Trappist monastery,
					either by the monks themselves or under their supervision.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The brewery must be of secondary importance within the monastery and
					it should witness to the business practices proper to a monastic way
					of life&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The brewery is not intended to be a profit-making venture.  The
					income covers the living expenses of the monks and the maintenance
					of the buildings and grounds.  Whatever remains is donated to
					charity for social work and to help persons in need.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are some standardized naming conventions, for instance the Double (orginally used by Westmalle) is a brown ale which has an alcohol level of around 7%. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Tripple is another name first used by Westmalle, which are often blond and have an alcohol level of about 8% to 10%. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For future reference you can always visit the &lt;a href="http://www.trappist.be/en/pages/trappist-beers" rel="nofollow"&gt;Trappiste website here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Simply put, a draft (or draught) beer is one that uses a mechanism to push the beer from it's container (barrel/keg or can.) Typically the beer is pushed using gas, or drawn via a partial vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A regular (non-draught) beer is a beer decanted without any special mechanism. For example a beer served directly from the bottle or a beer served from a tap inserted into the base of the cask/barrel and gravity fed. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When I visited Stella Artois brewery in Leuven (Belgium), they told us that they distributed the same beer in two kind of bottles. In brown reusable simply etiqueted bottles for distribution inside Belgium (note that it is a regular beer, the most drunk in Belgium), and in green more fancier etiqueted bottles with "imported" insciption on it for distribution around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In belgium Stella artois is a normal cheap beer, but where I live, in Spain, it is sold as imported special beer and costs more than double. However, the liquid inside the bottles is the same. So it is just marketing stragegy.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The guy who showed us the brewery was clear. While people outside belgium are kind to pay more for a fancier bottle, they would distribute more expensive fancier bottles.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Draft isn't a very regulated term but most often draws its meaning from context.  At a bar, draft is usually placed opposite bottled, meaning like you said that the beer is pushed using gas from a keg or drawn via vacuum from a cask.  This is the actual meaning of draft.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But..&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;On bottles and cans it most often means "Like-Draft", or the marketing department's way of telling you this beer tastes more like the version of our beer that you get when you go to bar and get off the tap, but in the comfort of your own home.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For a beer like Guinness or Boddingtons, this means a widget to hold high pressure Nitrogen gas to simulate the effects of a "Beer Gas" pouring system which uses a high pressure mixture of Nitrogen and CO2.  Guinness has actually replaced the widget in some of their "draught" packages as well, I believe the draught bottles.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But for a beer like Miller Genuine Draft, or the other Japanese beers you're mentioning, it just means the beer is unpasteurized which gives it a flavor more like what you get from a fresh, unpasteurized keg rather than a pasteurized and/or filtered bottled beer.  This is in line with the meaning of "nama" as you mentioned, as the beer is more "fresh" than traditional bottled beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's likely just naming differences.  Though the BJCP has distinct categories for "Dark American Lager" and "Schwarzbier (Black Beer)".  The main difference seems to be that Dark lager is sweeter and more towards caramel malt than Black which is more dry and slightly roasty.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ginger beer is not just water, sugar, crushed ginger and  yeast. I make it with some spices boilled in water to flavour it, some of it to kill off the yeast if I want it to. KIlling off the yeast makes it an ale ; and cider must have apples or apple juice in it.  That's my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;IMHO, I would classify ciders, perrys, and meads to be more like wine than beer -- they are made by fermenting fruit or honey without substantial change to the base ingredients. Beer is made from malted grain, which must first be mashed to convert starch into fermentable sugars. Beer must contain 4 essential ingredients: Malt extract (from the grain), hops, water and yeast. It may contain others as well, but if any of these four are missing it is not beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think that your premise of "that alcoholic drinks are essentially either Beers Wines or Spirits." is wrong because it oversimplifies and excludes some beverages. Besides mead and cider, there are also malt-based alcho-pop beverages (Mike's Hard Lemon, Twisted Tea, etc.) that I would not call beer either - they contain 3 of the four ingredients, but lack hops. There are other local indigenous alcoholic beverages around the world that don't fit any of these categories, like Japanese sake.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are many styles of beer -- so the word "beer" refers to all of them, and there is no style that is called just "beer". Here is a link that describes many styles of beer, mead and cider. Note that this is not a comprehensive list; brewers keep developing new styles all the time to create desirable products. For example, Black IPAs came into vogue a couple of years ago, now I am seeing White IPAs.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/catdex.php"&gt;BJCP Style Descriptions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is quite simple.
					Beer is made off starch (read: the alcohol)
					and Wines are made from fruit's sugar (fructose and glucose).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think the main difference is that beer is brewed - you have to steep the grain in water. You don't do this for meads or wines. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer generally refers to the fermented product of malted grains, yeast, water, and hops. An incredible variety of beers are derived from only these key ingredients, though many brewers do add additional ingredients called adjuncts (fruit, spices, herbs, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Mead is the product of fermented honey, sometimes called "honey wine", and is more comparable to the wine family (including cider and fruit wines) than beer in terms of body, alcohol, bitterness, base sugars, and typically effervescence.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beck's is a pale German pilsner brewed by Beck's Brewery headquartered in Bremen.  The actual beer you drank was likely brewed in St. Louis, however, as Beck's is wholly owned by AB InBev.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Pale Lagers as a style are usually straw colored, up to a light gold with a white head.  The flavor is very light and dry with only slight malty sweetness.  A little crisp hop bitterness without too much hop aroma.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most "macrobrews" will be somewhat similar, though the stock "American" variant of Pale Lager like Budweiser or Miller will have a corn sugar flavor to them and likely be a bit lighter in body.  Beck's claimed to adhere to the German Beer Purity Law which would prohibit the use of an adjunct like corn.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;St. Pauli Girl is a very similar beer, and I think is even brewed in the same town as the original Beck's.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you want to stick with imports just about any pale German lager is going to do it for you since it's a very traditional style.  Anything by Spaten, Hacker-Pschorr, or Weihenstephan is solid and usually pretty easy to get ahold of.  Pilsner-Urquell is also a great beer, but it's in the Pilsner style so while it's still a pale lager Pilsners can have a sulfur-y or buttery tinge due to the green bottles and slight diacetyl.  Pilsners also have a strong hop character and bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to try local or American brewed versions just about anyone's Session Lager (Full Sail comes to mind, as does Notch if you're near MA at all) should be similar.  According to &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/place/city/6/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this list&lt;/a&gt; on BeerAdvocate you should be near Berghoff and Baderbrau which will both make traditional German styles.  Some breweries, Baderbrau included, will call their pale lager a "Lawnmower beer".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Branching out, Sam Adams Boston Lager is a style called Vienna Lager which may also appeal you.  Though it will be significantly maltier than Beck's.  Anything with Dortmunder in the name will also be similar, though hoppier but not like an American Pale Ale or IPA or anything.  You might also be interested in any brewery's Cream Ale, which is an Ale version of the Pale Lager style.  Kolsch style beers may also appeal to you since they share the same light body and slight maltiness.  Kolsch's are hybrid beers which are fermented warm like an Ale would be, but then cold conditioned like a Lager.  Officially Kolsch can only be brewed in Cologne, Germany, but many American breweries will make a Kolsch style since it drinks really well in the summer and provides more flavor variety than pale lager or Cream Ale.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Does that help?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The term "cider" is generally reserved for apples.  There are 'pear ciders' such as Woodchuck that use the name, but as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cider"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; points out, "A similar product made from pears is called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry"&gt;perry&lt;/a&gt; but sometimes (incorrectly) called Pear Cider in the marketing of some producers' products".  I personally can forgive this, since pears are closely related to apples, and the result is quite tasty.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The "beer" part of ginger beer is due to the fermentation process involved in its creation.  In this way, it is more similar to "root beer", since ginger is a root, like the sassafras root used in root beer and birch roots used in birch beer.  The website todayifoundout.com has a well referenced article for &lt;a href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/07/why-root-beer-is-called-that/"&gt;Why Root Beer is Called That&lt;/a&gt; covering the naming of root beer.  If the ginger based version isn't fermented, but is instead ginger flavouring added to carbonated water, it would be "ginger ale"; I have no idea why, since an India Pale Ale is certainly fermented.  Even with ginger products, the differentiation is not really all that terribly strict, as noted by this &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/20/ginger-ale-vs-ginger-beer_n_1438420.html"&gt;Huffington Post article&lt;/a&gt;.  Initially, ginger beer, root beer, birch beer, etc, were frequently alcoholic, but Prohibition ruined that for the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a bit of a side note, the alcoholic versions are making a wonderful comeback (in my personal opinion) with &lt;a href="https://www.sprecherbrewery.com/hrb.php"&gt;Sprecher's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://smalltownbrewery.com/?page_id=11"&gt;Small Town Brewery&lt;/a&gt; for root beer.  I personally have not seen as much alcoholic ginger beer, but &lt;a href="http://www.crabbiesgingerbeer.co.uk/"&gt;Crabbies&lt;/a&gt; from the U.K. is quite good.  Although I personally do not like &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/697/24751/"&gt;Kuchi's ginger beer&lt;/a&gt;, I have several friends who absolutely love it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Fluid Ounces, even though it sounds like a measure of weight, is actually a measure of volume.  Specifically, 1 fluid ounce is the volume of 1 ounce (by weight) of pure water.  Similarly, in the metric system, 1 ml (or cubic centimeter) has 1 gram of mass, so often times (even in the US) you'll see ml listed as the volume as well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It sounds like you live in a place that uses the metric system. A fluid ounce (fl. oz.) is a measure of volume in U.S. customary units: 1 fluid ounce = 29.5735 milliliters. A Fluid ounce in British Imperial Units is slightly smaller: 1 fluid ounce = 28.413 ml. However, you are unlikely to find any modern labeling that uses British Imperial units since the U.K. has fully adopted the metric system, so in all likelihood the labels you are seeing refer to U.S. customary units.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Many large brewers, like AB InBev's famous Budweiser line, Miller-Coors' flagship brands and other Standard American Lagers (BJCP Style 1B) use adjunct grains in their grain bill.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aroma:&lt;/strong&gt; Little to no malt aroma, although it can be grainy, sweet or corn-like if present. Hop aroma may range from none to a light, spicy or floral hop presence. Low levels of yeast character (green apples, DMS, or fruitiness) are optional but acceptable. No diacetyl.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appearance:&lt;/strong&gt; Very pale straw to medium yellow color. White, frothy head
					  seldom persists. Very clear.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flavor:&lt;/strong&gt; Crisp and dry flavor with some low levels of grainy or
					  corn-like sweetness. Hop flavor ranges from none to low levels. Hop
					  bitterness at low to medium-low level. Balance may vary from slightly
					  malty to slightly bitter, but is relatively close to even. High levels
					  of carbonation may provide a slight acidity or dry "sting." No
					  diacetyl. No fruitiness.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mouthfeel:&lt;/strong&gt; Light body from use of a high percentage of adjuncts such
					  as rice or corn. Very highly carbonated with slight carbonic bite on
					  the tongue.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall Impression:&lt;/strong&gt; Very refreshing and thirst quenching.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comments:&lt;/strong&gt; Strong flavors are a fault. An international style including
					  the standard mass-market lager from most countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Two- or six-row barley with high percentage (up to 40%)
					  of rice or corn as adjuncts.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some beers bill themselves as a "Pale Ale", like Rolling Rock also use adjuncts, like rice.  This notation is designed to set them apart from those other beers.  It should be noted that the BJCP guidelines for a Pale Ale are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aroma:&lt;/strong&gt; Usually moderate to strong hop aroma from dry hopping or late
					  kettle additions of American hop varieties. A citrusy hop character is
					  very common, but not required. Low to moderate maltiness supports the
					  hop presentation, and may optionally show small amounts of specialty
					  malt character (bready, toasty, biscuity). Fruity esters vary from
					  moderate to none. No diacetyl. Dry hopping (if used) may add grassy
					  notes, although this character should not be excessive.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appearance:&lt;/strong&gt; Pale golden to deep amber. Moderately large white to
					  off-white head with good retention. Generally quite clear, although
					  dry-hopped versions may be slightly hazy.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flavor:&lt;/strong&gt; Usually a moderate to high hop flavor, often showing a citrusy
					  American hop character (although other hop varieties may be used). Low
					  to moderately high clean malt character supports the hop presentation,
					  and may optionally show small amounts of specialty malt character
					  (bready, toasty, biscuity). The balance is typically towards the late
					  hops and bitterness, but the malt presence can be substantial. Caramel
					  flavors are usually restrained or absent. Fruity esters can be
					  moderate to none. Moderate to high hop bitterness with a medium to dry
					  finish. Hop flavor and bitterness often lingers into the finish. No
					  diacetyl. Dry hopping (if used) may add grassy notes, although this
					  character should not be excessive.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mouthfeel:&lt;/strong&gt; Medium-light to medium body. Carbonation moderate to high.
					  Overall smooth finish without astringency often associated with high
					  hopping rates.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall Impression:&lt;/strong&gt; Refreshing and hoppy, yet with sufficient
					  supporting malt.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comments:&lt;/strong&gt; There is some overlap in color between American pale ale and
					  American amber ale. The American pale ale will generally be cleaner,
					  have a less caramelly malt profile, less body, and often more
					  finishing hops.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History:&lt;/strong&gt; An American adaptation of English pale ale, reflecting
					  indigenous ingredients (hops, malt, yeast, and water). Often lighter
					  in color, cleaner in fermentation by-products, and having less caramel
					  flavors than English counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Pale ale malt, typically American two-row. American hops,
					  often but not always ones with a citrusy character. American ale
					  yeast. Water can vary in sulfate content, but carbonate content should
					  be relatively low. Specialty grains may add character and complexity,
					  but generally make up a relatively small portion of the grist. Grains
					  that add malt flavor and richness, light sweetness, and toasty or
					  bready notes are often used (along with late hops) to differentiate
					  brands.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The only fermentable sugars are from malt, 2 row North American barley and English crystal malt in the case of this beer. So as others have stated no adjuncts are added. This beer does add ginger for flavoring&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Well in Germany these wouldn't be called beer because in Germany beer can contain only malt, hop, water and yeast. Since many Asian beers contain rice these aren't called beer in Germany.&lt;br&gt;
					I don't know if other countries even have regulations whether a drink is allowed to call itself beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Heineken is the closest. I only actually enjoy two brands of beer: Heineken used to be my favorite until I got bored with it and the store clerk recommended Beck's. They go hand in hand! Like peas in a pod!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beck's is a German pilsner (a type of lager), sharp, crisp, flavorfull, and is not filling. Beck's uses roasted hops and has a more bitter earthy flavor with much less foam.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The flavor of other "light lagers" (european pilsners) may be similar, however, a German pilsner is much easier to drink because, unlike most other light lager beers, a true pilsner is much less filling and has much less foam. German pilsners are noted for "drinkability". Beck's can be consumed with a large meal and then consumed afterwards as well. I believe this is why many non beer drinkers prefer and enjoy Beck's and almost no other beer. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilsner#Pilsner_beer_styles" rel="nofollow"&gt;Click here for a list of "German style pilsners" as well as a list of the other types of similar beers and what makes them different&lt;/a&gt; Light lagers such as Heinekin, Stella, Amstel, etc ... are "European pilsner" beers typically labeled as lager whereas a German pilsner beer is typically labeled "pilsner" or "pils".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/81/37570/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Heineken does produce a true pilsner variety&lt;/a&gt; but it is not officially distributed or available within the United States. &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/81/246/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Heineken lager&lt;/a&gt; is distributed and sold throughout North America and has much more body and is more filling as one would expect from a light lager or "european pilsner".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sam Adams Gold pilsner is described as having "great body". This is not a characteristic of most German pilsners that are sharp and light bodied. This beeradvocate post goes on to say that &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/articles/216/" rel="nofollow"&gt;"This is one of those beers to give to a Bud drinker"&lt;/a&gt; . . . definitely not something most people would say of Beck's. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Similar beers include: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Pauli_Girl" rel="nofollow"&gt;St Pauli Girl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;pilsner&lt;/strong&gt; (not to be confused with St Pauli Girl lager) is brewed for export only at the Beck's brewery in Bremen Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsingtao_Brewery" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tsingtao&lt;/a&gt;, a Chinese brewed German pilsner. Tsingtao is a product of the German occupation of Qingdao from the late 1800s until 1914. Not quite a flavorful as Beck's because the original recipe has changed but still a German pilsner in many aspects. Tsingtao is widely available at many Asian restaurants throughout North America and is a much better alternative or substitute for Beck's than Heinekin or Stella.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Löwenbräu produces Beck's under licence for southern Germany and other parts of europe and is known for similar flavor (but then again, so is Heineken).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/articles/216/" rel="nofollow"&gt;here is another list of German Pilsners.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Update:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're going to go the way of sam adams, at least get the right kind of beer and not some awful american lager. &lt;a href="https://www.samueladams.com/craft-beers/noble-pils" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sam Adams makes a Noble Pils.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Noble hops are the type of hops German pilsners are distinct for, strong hops flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Even better is &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/10607/62989/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sixpoint crisp&lt;/a&gt;. Strong hops flavor, easy to drink, and almost no hint of barley. More fruty than Beck's. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=2&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0CCsQFjAB&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPilsner_Urquell&amp;amp;ei=5P7GVIW-GMmyggS8s4GIAw&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNG2zAjSX00VamqUUpxEorf_KRbDiw&amp;amp;bvm=bv.84349003,d.eXY" rel="nofollow"&gt;Pilsner Urquell&lt;/a&gt; has a bit more foam than I would like from a German beer (probably because it's not German) but still did not weigh heavy on my stomach and easy to drink as well. Not quite as much flavor but I did not try the bottle. This one is a traditional pils.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I tried another German beer at the bar recently "&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://us.weihenstephaner.com/en/our-beers/?slide=Original%20Premium#slider-beer-main" rel="nofollow"&gt;Weihenstephaner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; original", brewed at the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weihenstephan_Abbey" rel="nofollow"&gt;world's oldest brewery&lt;/a&gt; in Germany and brewed according to the German purity law of 1516. Sure enough, I didn't have to burp once. Drank a full pint glass and wasn't bloated one bit. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finally, the taste was the same familiar strong, pungent, and bitter hoppy taste I've grown so fond of from drinking German Beck's over the years and yes it comes in a very dark brown bottle. The bitterness is ranked at 21. They also make a pils with a bitterness of 32.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I feel it should be added that beer brewed in Germany often conforms to the Reinheitsgebot or the German purity law of 1516. This gives German beer the crisp fresh taste and this is also why the foam doesn't linger and make you feel bloated. In all other countries, including the united states, beer manufacturers are known to &lt;a href="http://foodbabe.com/2013/07/17/the-shocking-ingredients-in-beer/" rel="nofollow"&gt;include many other ingredients&lt;/a&gt;. Notably, chemicals are added for "head retention" that are not included in German beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While I was in Germany, you had pretty much two common choices of beer available from the local brewery: Pils and Export. They were quite different, with Pils being lighter in color and taste and Export being darker and a little heavier flavor. They were in the same colored glass bottle with different labels. They are obviously two different beers. The name had nothing to do with whether it went out of the country or not. Now, maybe back when it was first developed way back when, it was exported to another people somewhere, I don't know. My beer knowledge is not that impressive, so I have relayed what I experienced. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the US, the "microbrewery" name is going away, and being replaced with "craft beer" as many formerly small breweries have grown so much. But they are still small compared to companies like Budweiser, Miller, Coors, etc. One &lt;a href="https://www.brewersassociation.org/statistics/craft-brewer-defined/" rel="nofollow"&gt;definition&lt;/a&gt; is: "Annual production of 6 million barrels of beer or less..." &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, they take every conceivable form: big restaurant plus small brewery, small restaurant attached to big brewery, tasting room in an industrial park (without food), some guy's garage... whatever the local law allows.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The only constants, for businesses that last, are good beer and staff that like beer too.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I found this pretty amazing &lt;a href="http://www.popsci.com/sites/popsci.com/files/styles/large_1x_/public/import/2013/images/2013/01/CBWFlavourWheelMarkDredge908.jpg?itok=7zVn407o"&gt;infographic&lt;/a&gt; at popsci.  Most of them seem pretty clear, but for context reading some of the &lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/catdex.php"&gt;BJCP Style Descriptions&lt;/a&gt; might help you out.  But really, describe it however it tastes to you even if the word isn't commonly used in beer tasting.  There are some hop varieties that, to me, smell and taste like raw green onions rubbed on feet so I just say that.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You judge a beer based on visual, aroma, taste, mouthfeel; and descriptive terms generally fall into these categories. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Visually you might describe the color of the brew (amber, golden, inky black, hazy, clear), the color and retention of the head, how the beer poured. Aroma might be described by smell of hops (floral, citrusy, resiny, piney, etc.), or malts (caramel, toffee, smoke, chocolate, etc), or other aromas present (molasses, booze, soy sauce, oak).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Describing taste opens up even more potential terminology, but don't be shy to use whatever terms or comparisons best describe the flavor for you. Think of tasting beer as an evolution of flavor in your mouth: describe how it hits your tongue; how the flavor builds, morphs, and leaves; and the aftertaste. You might use any word you would to describe the flavors of food and more to describe beer (Sweet, salty, sour, tangy, raisins, dough, bread, bacon, spicy, herbal, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finally, for mouthfeel, you're looking at words describing the texture and consistency; so ones like smooth, rich, chalky, gritty, effervescent, thick, syrupy, etc., are very useful when appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There was a lexicon written, but it does not seem that it ever made it to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Trained tasters have fairly similar tastes, as that is what makes them so important. Thus they will know the difference between roasty, coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, white chocolate, coffee with milk, latte.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The beer descriptors (I think) are a lot more down to earth. (To quote CBR) If beer had a wine vocabulary, we would say simcoe is feline, as opposed to cat piss! :p&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Listen to podcasts like Dr Homebrew, Brewing With Style and Craft Beer Radio. They rate the beers, providing amazing insight to the vocabulary of a beer judge as well as the judging process.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In Wisconsin, there is not a coined term for those types of "craft brews" as produced by a global brewery.  They are generally referred to simply by describing the brew as a/an fake or impostor craft, craft-style beer, or Big Beer craft.  (The descriptors simply degenerate as the beer-passion elevates.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This 2013 TIME article simply references "Faux Craft" and "Crafty"
					&lt;a href="http://business.time.com/2013/08/13/that-craft-beer-youre-drinking-isnt-craft-beer-do-you-care/"&gt;http://business.time.com/2013/08/13/that-craft-beer-youre-drinking-isnt-craft-beer-do-you-care/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If it's a matter of simply communicating effectively, I don't feel the need to use a coined term (as astroturf is to grassroots).  For marketing purposes, however, it seems there is still time for a hilariously ironic name to be coined.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Young in terms of establishments - Micropubs "traditionally" have to adhere to certain "standards": &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is only one room&lt;br&gt;
					Generally too small to have a bar&lt;br&gt;
					No Televisions&lt;br&gt;
					No Juke Boxes&lt;br&gt;
					No manufactured (think commercialized) beer&lt;br&gt;
					No lagers! (Literally is a dirty word - think yelling a racial slur among the people associated with that slur)&lt;br&gt;
					No spirits (usually just Wine, Ale, Cider - though soft drinks and water can be supplied for children and DDs)  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The focus is to shun electronics (outside of electricity) focus on social interactions and ales (and maybe sometimes pub snacks).  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This seems to be a very United Kingdom centered movement (as I havent heard of this in the US).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I believe the type of glass you are looking for is called an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Fashioned_glass" rel="noreferrer"&gt;"Old Fashioned glass"&lt;/a&gt; named for the cocktail typically served in it. Depending on the size of the drink you may possibly want request your drink in a "Double Old Fashioned glass". I would hope that simply requesting your martini be served in an Old Fashioned glass would suffice.&lt;/p&gt;
