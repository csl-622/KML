					&lt;p&gt;Plastic food packaging in general is usually lined with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_A" rel="nofollow"&gt;Bisphenol A (aka. BPA)&lt;/a&gt;, as are some canned goods, which is a rather controversial chemical. It's been linked to cancer, sexual dysfunction, and other ailments. So I try to avoid it whenever possible and buy my food in glass jars. I can only imagine how much BPA is  dissolved into alcoholic beverages which are bottled in plastic or cans, being that alcohol is corrosive. I learned that lesson when I tried cleaning my GameBoy with rubbing alcohol as a kid. So I try to avoid alcohol bottled in plastic and canned alcohol as well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The thing you have to realize is that plastic isn't really a solid, but a very viscous liquid. Glass is also a liquid, but it's much more viscous than plastic. That's why if you've ever been in a building that's a couple hundred years old, the glass on the windows is thicker at the bottom of the glass panes. Since both are liquids, they're obviously going to get into your drink. However, glass is a natural substance while plastic is not, so I trust it more.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;tl;dr—We don't know (via science, at least).&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Letting alone ethanol, which triggers innumerable biochemical pathways in our bodies, hops itself &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; affect potency and sexual desire, in males at least, but there appears to be few clinical studies supporting this claim directly. Many articles online appear to have chained together several studies (or played news-telephone) to publish indirect conclusions, many of which oversimplify the effects of estrogen. For example, contrary to popular belief, it isn't &lt;em&gt;testosterone&lt;/em&gt; (alone) which masculinizes the male brain and behavior, but rather &lt;em&gt;its interaction with estrogen&lt;/em&gt;, produced &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; testosterone through a process known as aromatization.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; So it's not as simple as more-estrogen-less-sex-drive.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm certainly not qualified to deliver conclusions myself, but I can at least point to some of the important studies from which current (mis)conceptions have derived.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1: &lt;a href="http://shahlab.ucsf.edu/papers/paper14.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wu, M. V. et al. Estrogen Masculinizes Neural Pathways and Sex-Specific Behaviors. 2009. [PDF]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Why some claim that hops decreases sex drive...&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hops contains phytoestrogens,&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;substances that promote estrogenic actions in mammals and structurally are similar to mammalian estrogen 17&amp;beta;-estradiol (E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) [...]&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.comilac.com.tr/uploads/pdf/22ComFUGA.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ososki, A. L. and Kennelly, E. J. Phytoestrogens: a Review of the Present State of Research. 2003. [PDF]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Specifically,&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;a recurring suggestion has been that hops have a powerful estrogenic activity and that beer may also be estrogenic. [...] We have identified a potent phytoestrogen in hops, 8-prenylnaringenin, which has an activity greater than other established plant estrogens.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://press.endocrine.org/doi/pdf/10.1210/jcem.84.6.5887" rel="nofollow"&gt;Milligan, S. R. et al. Identification of a potent phytoestrogen in hops (&lt;em&gt;Humulus lupulus&lt;/em&gt; L.) and beer. 1999. [PDF]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, it's worth noting that the same paper concludes,&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;[...] despite the high estrogenic activity of 8-prenylnarigenin, the total estrogenic activity of beer made using whole hops is still low [...] and no detrimental health effects due to "estrogens in beer" are to be expected.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Anyway, another study led by the same researcher delved into the mechanism of action:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;8-Prenylnaringenin alone competed strongly with 17&amp;beta;-estradiol for binding to both the &amp;alpha;- and &amp;beta;-estrogen receptors.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://press.endocrine.org/doi/pdf/10.1210/jcem.85.12.7168" rel="nofollow"&gt;Milligan, S. R. et al. The endocrine activities of 8-prenylnargingenin and related hop (&lt;em&gt;Humulus lupulus&lt;/em&gt; L.) flavonoids. 2000. [PDF]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;(In case one is unfamiliar with how receptors work, receptors "catch" freestanding compounds in a medium such as the bloodstream, thereby reducing their effects. The phytoestrogen in hops appears to get itself "caught" by estrogen receptors, thereby blocking those receptors from catching estrogen it'd normally catch, thereby leaving higher levels of estrogen in the bloodstream.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;...but it's not that simple!&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Again, from these findings alone, conclusions about male potency and sex drive can't be so easily drawn. Hormone interactions are sufficiently complex that researchers are still trying to untangle, isolate, and explain ever-more-specific biochemical pathways. Certainly the average Joe (or journalist) wouldn't be capable of appreciating the magnitude (or triviality) of the effects of biochemical pathways described in researchers' findings, much less draw definitive conclusions about physiological effects like "potency," "sex drive," and how it all affects, say, muscle-building. Not to mention all the other chemicals in play!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a very example of the latter, one site [&lt;a href="http://www.peaktestosterone.com/Testosterone_Beer.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;] (which, unfortunately, ranks high among Google search results) is clearly biased, grasping for evidence to "prove" that beer has detrimental effects on testosterone activity. I'm not saying beer &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt;, but their article states that Xanthohumol, another compound found in hops, "blocks testosterone," when in fact &lt;em&gt;the very paper it cites&lt;/em&gt; says (in its abstract nonetheless),&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Although hops is commonly linked with phytoestrogenic effects, we identified XN [Xanthohumol] as a pure estrogen antogonist. Interestingly, XN may also reduce the generation of estrogens by inhibition of the enzymatic activity of aromatase, which converts testosterone to estrogen. Anti-estrogenic effects of XN [...] were confirmed in vivo in an uterotrophy assay with prepubertal rats.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dkfz.de/en/tox/download/gerh/pdf-files/Proc.-2nd-Humulus-Symposium-2009.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;Strathmann, J. et al. Xanthohumol from Hops Prevents Hormone-Dependent Tumourigenesis In Vitro and In Vivo. 2008. [PDF]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;On top of all this, ethanol affects so many parts of the brain via so many chemical pathways—what's even the significance of 8-prenylnarigenin or Xanthohumol when stacked against ethanol? Do you know?—I sure don't—and probably no one does—else it'd have been stated by researchers themselves, without the "help" of attention-seeking bloggers and headline-hunting journalists.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;In conclusion,&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying these blogs, articles, and threads are necessarily &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;—they might be right, whether right-by-chance, or right-by-empiricism (observation). What I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; saying is that they can't be &lt;em&gt;right-by-science&lt;/em&gt;, as currently available research seems extremely domain-specific, incomplete in larger perspectives, and therefore not generalizable.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Addendum&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The study by Ososki and Kennelly also states&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;As potential endocrine disrupters, phytoestrogens may act as antiestrogens and harm the reproductive health of males (Sharpe and Skakkebaek, 1993; Santti &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;, 1998). Reduced sperm quality, undescended testes and urogenital tract abnormalities were increased in the sons of mothers taking DES compared with those who did not take the miscarriage preventative drug [...]&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This statement is initially misleading as it says "males" instead of "&lt;em&gt;developing&lt;/em&gt; males"—a fact not made clear until the following sentence. From the studies it cites (emphasis mine),&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;We argue that the increasing incidence of reproductive abnormalities in the human male may be related to increased oestrogen exposure &lt;strong&gt;in utero&lt;/strong&gt;, and identify mechanisms by which this exposure could occur.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/014067369390953E" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sharpe, R. M. and Skakkebaek, N. E. Are oestrogens involved in falling sperm counts and disorders of the male reproductive tract? 1993. [URL]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) induces persistent structural and functional alterations in the &lt;strong&gt;developing&lt;/strong&gt; reproductive tract of males.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://tih.sagepub.com/content/14/1-2/223.short" rel="nofollow"&gt;Santti R. et al. Phytoestrogens: Potential Endocrine Disruptors in Males. [URL]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, more potential sources of misunderstanding and misreporting.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Our bodies are ecosystems as much as they are machines.  We have a wide variety of microbes in our intestines and even if the yeast is not the culprit something else could be encouraged to grow.  I tend to suspect this is the real problem for the entirely unscientific reason that I have never noticed pasteurization to affect whether I am bloated after drinking beer (and sometimes it happens, and sometimes it doesn't).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So in answer to your question, it is complicated, and it might be a factor but it is almost certainly not the only one.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I guess there are 2 important think to point out:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Beer is also alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That is directly from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_and_sex#Alcohol_and_sex_in_men" rel="nofollow"&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Men's sexual behaviors can be affected dramatically by alcohol. Both chronic and acute alcohol consumption have been shown in most (but not all) studies to inhibit testosterone production in the testes. This is believed to be caused by the metabolism of alcohol reducing the NAD+/NADH ratio both in the liver and the testes; since the synthesis of testosterone requires NAD+, this tends to reduce testosterone production.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;As testosterone is critical for libido and physical arousal, alcohol tends to have deleterious effects on male sexual performance. Studies have been conducted that indicate increasing levels of alcohol intoxication produce a significant degradation in male masturbatory effectiveness (MME). This degradation was measured by measuring blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and ejaculation latency. Alcohol intoxication can decrease sexual arousal, decrease pleasureability and intensity of orgasm, and increase difficulty in attaining orgasm.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Since wikipedia show related soruce of that info and most of them are clinical research, we can say that alcohol have a negative effect on men.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;In many women, alcohol increases sexual arousal and desire, although it does lower the physiological signs of arousal. Women have a different response to alcohol intoxication. Studies have shown that acute alcohol consumption tends to cause increased levels of testosterone and estradiol. Since testosterone controls in part the strength of libido in women, this tends to cause an increase in interest in sex. Also, because women have a higher percentage of body fat and less water in their bodies, alcohol can have a quicker, more severe impact. Women’s bodies take longer to process alcohol; more precisely, a woman's body often takes one-third longer to eliminate the substance.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Sexual behavior in women under the influence of alcohol is also different from men. Studies have shown that increased BAC is associated with longer orgasmic latencies and decreased intensity of orgasm. Some women report a greater sexual arousal with increased alcohol consumption as well as increased sensations of pleasure during orgasm. Because ejaculatory response is visual and can more easily be measured in males, orgasmic response must be measured more intimately. In studies of the female orgasm under the influence of alcohol, orgasmic latencies were measured using a vaginal photoplethysmograph, which essentially measures vaginal blood volume.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Different from men, we can say alcohol have more pros beside few cons for women.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Beer and couples&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;h3&gt;Men&lt;/h3&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer is probably the least powerful aphrodisiac alcoholic drink. The alcohol percentage in beer is low, meaning that more liquid has to be consumed to raise men's testosterone levels to hit that "comfortable" level. Most beers are very nourishing and filling, and when too many of them are consumed, they can create an unpleasant stomachache. Drinking too much beer will make men go to the washroom more often, as well as create a bloating sensation. The effects of being bloated surely don't entice sexual encounters and won't lead men to seek out sexual opportunities. Yet, some special beers have a local reputation for increasing libido, but even with that, beer is not the best choice for men.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h3&gt;Women&lt;/h3&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While hops in beer will have a negative impact on men’s hormonal balance, it may actually be positive for women. Hops has aphrodisiac-like qualities for women, as because of the phytoestrogen it contains, which mimic natural estrogen. Low sex drive in women is often cause by low levels of estrogen.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Consuming beer, especially hop-rich varieties like IPA, could actually help restore hormonal balance and help with libido and also alleviate menopausal symptoms of fatigue, irritability and hot flashes&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer was commonly drunk in the middle ages (and renaissance), but what they drank is different from the beer we're used to today.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer and ale, being grain-based, were important dietary staples -- it's said that beer is liquid bread, and that's not far off.  For the common man (not nobility), in particular, grain made up a substantial part of the diet, with meat being fairly rare.  (Will try to update later with a friend's research on amount of grain/household consumed in medieval England, but it's substantial.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Common beer was not aged for months or years like some beers today; rather, a batch might be produced in as little as half a week.  These are "small beers" (or "small ales", for the unhopped variety), which are mildly alcoholic but drinkable in volume without unfortunate effects.  These small beers/ales were produced in the home/manor; it was just one more task for the cooks.  (See, for example, Markham's &lt;em&gt;The English Housewife&lt;/em&gt;, 1615 -- so that's rnnaissance not medieval, but is consistent with earlier cooking sources I've seen.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm not aware of exceptions being made for pregnant women and small children.  Arguing from absence of evidence is risky, but I've worked with a variety of medieval and renaissance cookbooks and the occasional medicinal source, and I haven't seen anything along the lines of "drinks for the pregnant and young".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You may find the following helpful:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer apparently not only lowers the risk of kidney stones, but also helps dissolve and pass existing kidney stones (additionally by dilating the ureters—the tubes connecting the kidneys to the bladder).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Beer consumption was inversely associated with risk of kidney stones; each bottle of beer consumed per day was estimated to reduce risk by 40% [...]&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Just like wine, absolutely! I'm not a doctor and I am not giving medical advice; I am not liable whatsoever for your drunken antics. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With that said, in addition to kidney benefits:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Beer contains high amounts of silicon, which makes bones stronger&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;In moderation, it has been shown to lower the risk of cardiovascular problems. However, when abused, cardiovascular problems spike instead. It helps to raise levels of "good cholesterol" which helps to keep arteries free of blockages.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;It may help out your brain, keeping Alzheimer's disease at bay.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;It is high in antioxidants and helps reduce your risk of cancer.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;It is high in B vitamins, namely B6 and B12&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Moderate amounts of any alcohol, beer included, may help decrease your risk of stroke by reducing the chance of blood clotting in the cardiovascular system.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;I highly doubt this one, but apparently, studies have shown a reduced risk of diabetes among men who drink occasionally.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Studies have shown that it has been linked to lower blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;It contain fiber! Beta-glucans in particular, which are a soluble type of fiber.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Like sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi, yogurt, miso, and kombucha, beer is a fermented food, so many of the benefits of fermented foods such as aiding in digestion may apply to beer as well.&lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I do not know much  but I know there is a published book about that. &lt;strong&gt;Beer in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Richard W. Unger&lt;/em&gt;. Some lines from the excerpt of the book:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Modern beer, however, has little in common with the drink that carried that name through the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Looking at a time when beer was often a nutritional necessity, was sometimes used as medicine, could be flavored with everything from the bark of fir trees to thyme and fresh eggs, &lt;strong&gt;and was consumed by men, women, and children alike&lt;/strong&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was the beverage of choice of urban populations that lacked access to secure sources of potable water&lt;/strong&gt;; a commodity of economic as well as social importance; &lt;strong&gt;a safe drink for daily consumption that was less expensive than wine&lt;/strong&gt;; and a major source of tax revenue for the state. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Unger describes the transformation of the industry &lt;strong&gt;from small-scale production that was a basic part of housewifery&lt;/strong&gt; to a highly regulated commercial enterprise dominated by the wealthy and overseen by government authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These are some part I crop from the excerpt. Probably book have more but since I do not own it, I can not help you more.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;update: There is a big excerpt in &lt;a href="http://books.google.com.tr/books?id=7eYLjJp0y7UC"&gt;Google Books&lt;/a&gt;. It contains first a few tens of pages with some removed pages but I guess it will give you more ingormation about that.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a number of uses I have heard of people using beer for.  I will add a personal experience below as well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have heard of people washing their hair with it, believing it helps promote healthy hair and scalp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy, high starch beers, have long been used as a food source for fasting monks, sort of a liquid bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beer is commonly used for cooking certain things because the alcohol (as with wine) helps bring out certain flavors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Additionally I want to mention something I use it for.  This works for me because of very specific reasons and &lt;strong&gt;I am not recommending that anyone else try it.&lt;/strong&gt;  However, I get asthma frequently following upper respiratory illnesses (I have since I was a teenager).  I have a couple of alternative medical strategies for dealing with this depending on what is available.  Note, if you have asthma, don't take medical advice from me: asthma can be life threatening.  Work with a doctor.   However, among other things, I find that drinking a number of drinks of beer or wine for two nights in a row will cause the asthma to clear up until I get sick again.  This naturally works best when I am not otherwise consuming alcohol, but it allows me to be mostly medication free regarding my asthma (doing this two to three times a year).  Again this has a bunch of risks, so I am mentioning it just for informational purposes.  In general anything medical deserves a great deal of respect because what can cure can kill.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also some kinds of traditional beer have very specific health benefits.  In Indonesia, "tape hitam" (black rice beer, consumed with the lees as a sort of soup) is generally understood to reduce blood cholesterol.  As it turns out the helper cultures used are extremely close (and sometimes the same) as those which produce lovostatin.  In fact lovostatin was originally found in Chinese fermented rice products.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The answer is complex, to be honest.  In the Middle Ages?  Where?  When?  These are important questions.  Lumping around a thousand years and very different cultural eras (ranging from the Vendell-era Norse to the Byzantine Empire) into the same label is problematic at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The answer I think to the question as stated has to be "no" insofar as there were times and places in the Middle Ages where beer was a clear luxury (early medieval Iceland comes to mind).  Similarly, it isn't always clear that beer was universally consumed by the lower classes in much of the Middle Ages (though certainly towards the end it became more common).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 1:  Anglo-Saxon England&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This being said, beer was an important dietary staple in much (though not all!) of medieval Europe at least among monks, merchants, and the upper classes.  Heavier beers were used as bread substitutes.  For the common man in Anglo-Saxon England, though, even bread was a luxury  and most grains were cooked into gruel, porridge, either with or without fracturing (think of bulgur wheat).  This would then be supplemented with vegetables, eggs, dairy, and sometimes meat (even for the serfs, at least in Anglo-Saxon England, meat was not out of the question).  Well water was the primary source of hydration in this era (again see Hagen, below), and laws were passed to ensure that drinking water directly from someone else's well was protected, legal activity (in other words, a well owner could restrict what people could take away from the well, but not what they could drink on the spot).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If we separate out the lower classes and the areas where beer was not commonly available (Iceland, for example) the picture changes dramatically.  Beer was very common, but not at all a homogeneous beverage.  Bald's Leechbook (10th Century, Anglo-Saxon) contains the warning that while "&lt;em&gt;ealu&lt;/em&gt;" (-&gt; ale) may be consumed by pregnant women, "&lt;em&gt;beor&lt;/em&gt;" (-&gt; beer) causes miscarriage.  Identifying these beverages is problematic. Ann Hagen ("Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink") suggests that "beor" must have been a strong mead instead of a malt liquor based on descriptions of specific gravity (she calculates a minimum alcohol content of around 20%).  If it was a strong mead, it may have been further supplemented by herbs like mugwort, henbane, and hops, and therefore even more problematic than a strong mead might be.  In this case, it would have been fermented grains would have been certainly consumed by children and pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Interestingly the traditional fermented rice and cassava dishes here in Indonesia are acceptable to serve to children too.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources on history&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Hagen, Ann.  "&lt;em&gt;Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Pollington, Stephen.  "&lt;em&gt;Leechcraft&lt;/em&gt;" (for an edition of Bald's Leechbook with facing page translation).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 2:  Medieval Iceland&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The early Icelandic settlers tried to grow barley for beer with only very limited success.  Alcoholic beverages were thus very much a luxury item, and usually if someone was going to have it (going mostly by medieval saga evidence as ethnography), it was going to be someone who had gone viking and returned with a fair bit of wealth.  A second point though is that Icelandic society recognized about three levels of society (&lt;em&gt;godhi&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;bondi&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;thrall&lt;/em&gt;) based on relationship to certain kinds of property:  a &lt;em&gt;godhi&lt;/em&gt; (priest-attorney-legislator-jurist) owned a &lt;em&gt;godhord&lt;/em&gt; (the office was property and could be sold, loaned, or even put into partnership property).  A &lt;em&gt;bondi&lt;/em&gt; (free juryman) owned land.  And a &lt;em&gt;thrall&lt;/em&gt; was owned (though the actual requirements would have been more like early serfdom than slavery due to a lack of central administration and enforcement).  In addition to successful bondi-turned-vikings, you would have had the fact that a godhi had sufficient economic benefits from office to likely be able to afford alcoholic beverages at least sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In Iceland, drinking was usually a social action and as far as the existing evidence goes would have been a specifically male activity limited to the sorts of ritualized drinking portrayed in Beowulf (such ritualized drinking is portrayed in the Volsung Saga, Egill's Saga, Njall's Saga, and many many others).  Drunkenness was warned against in the literature, and there are very interesting questions of what else was put in the beverages, since poisoning was a pretty clear concern in the literature (Eddic poems such as Havamal and Sigdrifumal speak to both these concerns).  From archaeological evidence from "continental" Scandinavia, we may surmise henbane was common, and this may to some extent play into the references to military drinking in Hrolf Kraki's Saga.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In short, in Iceland, as far as we can tell, beer and mead would have been limited to far more ritualized roles (reinforcing social obligations, certain forms of oaths, etc).  Literature on women and alcohol is very sparse.  It's probable that the bride drank at the wedding as part of making the wedding official.  There's a lot of uncertainty beyond this however in terms of attitudes towards pregnancy and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Further reading:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;the various sagas referenced above.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Poetic Edda&lt;/em&gt; (I usually recommend the Hollander translation if you are going to work in translation because he tends to be transparent about which emendations he is using).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Byock, Jesse:  &lt;em&gt;Viking-Age Iceland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Byock, Jesse:  &lt;em&gt;Medieval Iceland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Roesdahl, Else: &lt;em&gt;The Vikings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Pollington, Stephen: &lt;em&gt;Leechcraft&lt;/em&gt; (for some archaeological discussions of Scandinavian forts and brewing).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most beer has a lot of calories. Just like any other calorie intake, if you consume more than you burn, you will gain weight.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, yes, drinking "too much" beer will "increase the size of belly". What "too much" means, however, is dependent on your other habits.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The typical "(beer | pot) (belly | gut)" is usually "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_obesity"&gt;Abdominal Obesity&lt;/a&gt;" which, by definition, means obesity in the abdominal area specifically, i.e. the belly. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There might be trace amounts of it due to the oxidization of methanol from partially fermented sugars.  But unless it is added to beer, not enough to be significant as opposed to other compounds that are present.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h3&gt;Use&lt;/h3&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Formaldehyde can be used as a cheap clarification agent (making the beer clear; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrus_crispus"&gt;irish moss&lt;/a&gt; is a safe additive used for the same purpose).  However, as it's a known carcinogen, it should be used very minimally.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h3&gt;Prevalence&lt;/h3&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;TLDR: It's not widely used, and its use is in decline.  Here's &lt;a href="http://www.beer-faq.com/formaldehyde-beer/"&gt;a reasonably well-sourced article&lt;/a&gt; on it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It was hard to find any good sources on it, but:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Various articles and blog posts seem to indicate there may be some in a few Chinese beers.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Most beers with formaldehyde have below the WHO safety limit, and so are fine to drink.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Some sources seem to say that formaldehyde may occur naturally in some brewing processes, but only in trace (and safe) amounts.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A beer belly comes not so much from beer and the frequent drinking of it as it does with the food that is typically associated with beer (for example, burgers, pizza, etc... very high in calories).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;tl;dr—Yes, but only at safe levels.&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Formaldehyde was detected in beer, at safe levels, as far back as 1983:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;A simple procedure was developed for the determination of formaldehyde in samples of beer and soft drinks. [...] Levels of formaldehyde found were in the low mg/kg range. Detection limits were less than 0.1 mg/kg of sample.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03067318308071912#.UuleRfm-1cY"&gt;Lawrence, J. F. and Iyengar, J. R. The Determination of Formaldehyde in Beer and Soft Drinks by HPLC of the 2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazone Derivative. 1983; published online 2006. [URL]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A more recent study summarizes how China came under scrutiny, but also how industry standards have changed since (emphasis mine, hereon):&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;In 2005, various Chinese newspapers reported that formaldehyde was detected in 95% of the samples of Chinese commercial bottled beers tested in the course of a journalistic investigation. The addition of formaldehyde during mashing is allowed in China, and it is believed to improve the clarity of the resulting wort and beer and the colloidal stability of the latter. &lt;strong&gt;Nevertheless, the hygienic standard for fermented alcoholic beverages in China was revised, to stipulate that the formaldehyde content of the finished beer must not exceed 2 mg/L.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2050-0416.2006.tb00733.x/pdf"&gt;Wu, Q. &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; Investigation into Benzene, Trihalomethanes, and Formaldehyde in Chinese Lager Beers. 2012. [PDF]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From the abstract of the same paper,&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Beers brewed commercially in China have been surveyed for the presence of a number of potential contaminants, including benzene, trihalomethanes and formaldehyde. [...] Formaldehyde was measured in 29 beers (including 7 imported brands) using solid-phase microextraction with on-fiber derivatization. Formaldehyde levels were between 0.082&amp;ndash;0.356 mg/L. &lt;strong&gt;None of the beer samples exceeded WHO drinking water criteria for benzene, trihalomethanes or formaldehyde.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared their results to existing literature, which they found were similar:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Donhauser and co-workers examined beers from Europe, using a HPLC method, and showed that 65% of them contained detectable formaldehyde, although in many the level was close to the detection limit of 0.2 mg/L. More recently, the South Korean Food and Drug Administration has analysed imported beers (13 from China and 4 from Germany). They found that the average content of formaldehyde was 0.132 mg/L, which was compatible with food safety legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;(I couldn't find a free link to the above-referenced material, only &lt;a href="http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?f=1987/DE/DE87098.xml;DE86J0377"&gt;a citation&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Apparently, formaldehyde does appear naturally in the brewing process (though, again, I couldn't find the study, only &lt;a href="http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?f=2012/OV/OV201203266003266.xml;DE19950083764"&gt;another citation&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Borchert has confirmed that formaldehyde can be formed naturally in the brewing process, thus beers can contain up to 0.1 mg/L of formaldehyde, even when none is used in the brewery.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Anyway, formaldehyde no longer seems preferred as a clarification agent, as a substitute exists:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;To meet consumer expectations and to avoid further problems, more and more breweries now choose &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone"&gt;PVPP&lt;/a&gt; as a replacement product for the clarification of wort and beer.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Well, yes, beer has some calories, according to this article; &lt;a href="http://www.webmd.com/diet/features/the-truth-about-beer-and-your-belly" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Truth About Beer and Your Belly&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;A typical beer has 150 calories – and if you down several in one
					  sitting, you can end up with serious calorie overload.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;but read further&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Alcohol can increase your appetite. Further, when you're drinking
					  beer at a bar or party, the food on hand is often fattening fare like
					  pizza, wings, and other fried foods&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've heard from a lot of people that beer increases appetite more that other alcoholic drinks, and in fact beer pairs very well with such calorie rich food as pig knuckle, or similar... as well as pizza, chips etc. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you compare calories in beer and pig knuckle you'll see what is more likely to cause obesity. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There was a study at the University of Tokushima that showed beer containing flavaprenin

					&lt;p&gt;No, drinking warm beer will not prevent the common cold.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There was at least one study conducted revealing that humulone, an chemical found in hops, could help to fight a cold. This study seems to be both biased and exaggerated, as it was conducted by a beer company and the concentration in beer is so low that getting a therapeutic dose would create more problems than it would solve.
					&lt;a href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/12/10/got-a-cold-have-a-beer/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Got a Cold? Have a Beer!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I imagine that the rumor was based on either the above misleading story or a similar one based on a historical view of beer through "rose colored glasses".
					This coupled with the commonly known (and scientifically supported) method of drinking hot fluids to treat cold symptoms creates a believable enough tale to increase sales.
					&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/south_east/7771893.stm" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Study finds hot drinks help colds.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;No.  An adjunct is simply an ingredient that is not strictly necessary to brew the beer.  In some cases the purpose of the adjunct is to reduce costs, while in others it is to achieve certain flavours (e.g. in honey beers, or various spiced beers).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If cost is the primary concern, then GMO ingredients may be picked if they are cheapest.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When adjuncts are used for flavour, cost is not going to be the primary concern so it would be incorrect to assume that a GMO source would be picked by default.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The chances of corn being grown for industrial purposes, like making dextrose have a very high probability of being GMO. If you are buying specialty grains (like for steeping), the probability of those ingredients being genetically modified are much lower. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, finding out whether or not your adjunct is made from GMO corn (or rice) is very difficult. You may be able to find companies that market things as GMO-free, in that case, they are &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; GMO free. Otherwise, they may or may not contain GMOs. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are concerned about the safety of genetic modification, you should know that GMOs are very safe and are tested for safety much more than the wild crops their genes are borrowed from. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First of all, GMO seem to be getting a bad reputation, as opposed to the hormones that are given to animals, like dairy cows.  In general, GMOs are safe.  In fact, modifying plants' properties and features to something that the farmer wants is been going on for thousands of years (it's how we got broccoli from a plant that looked more like kale).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, many of the Light Lagers (BJCP Styles 1A, 1B and 1C) have adjuncts like corn and rice (as much as 40% of the total grain bill), both of which are notorious for having many varieties that are GMO.  One of the reasons for this is that it allows the brewer to brew a high ABV beer and add water back to bring the ABV down to whatever the local laws say are the maximum without being labeled with the ABV.  Large breweries will manufacture in one state and sell their product in many states.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have noticed that some beer labels list GMO free rather prominently, however, if a GMO free lifestyle is something you're interested in, I would stick to beers that have ONLY Barley, Hops, Water and Yeast as ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;According the Briess, a very large maltster, website:
					[B]ecause malt is made from whole grain and minimally processed, it is an all natural ingredient that helps achieve product claims like natural, healthy, Kosher and non-GMO.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes it does! A beer belly is caused by excess calorie intake and reduced calorie expenditure because of a sedentary lifestyle.

					&lt;p&gt;It depends... I don't see an issue with the standard Tums or Rolaids but there might be issues with ranitidine according to some studies.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/news/20000215/zantac-alcohol-dont-mix"&gt;http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/news/20000215/zantac-alcohol-dont-mix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"The effect was striking," says author Charles Lieber, MD. In a
					  three-hour test period, conducted under conditions similar to social
					  drinking, the study showed that ranitidine can increase blood alcohol
					  content by 38%. Levels reached in the study exceeded the legal
					  drinking limit -- and the effects lasted up to two hours after
					  drinking stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Although I don't have any medical data to back it up, I feel that the old remedy of drinking hot beer actually helps with cold. I live in Poland, and just like in Germany we do use this old world remedy of drinking warm/hot beer to keep the cold away. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What's more is, that here in Poland serving warm beer with spices, sometimes with honey is really popular in the fall. And although my comment will probably get bashed by not having a medical back up -- it really feels like the warm beer helps the body fight off the bacteria/germs.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Now that I think of it...The tradition of drinking warm beer is probably comparable to drinking mulled wine (in poland referred to as Grzaniec, and Glühwein in Germany).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Drinking beer alone does not cause you to get a big belly, it's the amount food that goes along with it. People usually drink beer in the evening, and tend to eat a lot of food at the same time. And this is great and dandy, but what people forget about is that they eat late (here combined with drinking beer so even more calories), and then go straight to bed. The body does not have a chance to break down all of these calories, and instead all of this excess fat is being stored.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In short, the beer alone does not cause the fat, it's the food that goes along with it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Calories are calories. A typical middle-aged male needs about 2100 calories per day. Consuming more calories than this per day will increase your weight. If you drink four 12-ounce regular (5%) beers per day, you will add between 500-700 calories to your daily diet -- depending on the style of beer you consume, meaning its sugar content, which will vary with beer style. This calorie range translates into around 3500-5000 extra calories per week, which is equivalent to gaining about 1.0-1.4 lbs of weight per week if this calorie intake is above your body's minimum requirement (ie: 2100 x 7 days). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;After 3 months you will have gained anywhere from 13-18 lbs. It doesn't matter what you eat or don't eat along with your beer. If your beer drinking brings you over the 2100 calorie per-day threshold, those calories will show up as fat in your body. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;All of this assumes no exercise. If you are active and can burn off 300-500 calories a day through a combination of working out and regular body movement (general walking, going up and down stairs, prolonged upper-body activity), then you will cut into that calorie gain in proportion to your activity.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;QI provides the answer: with a few exceptions (where it will make you vomit) it is perfectly safe to drink alcohol whilst taking antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Apart from some special circumstances, it is on the whole OK to drink while on antibiotics. The reason why people think that you should not is that when antibiotics was first being used it was to cure syphilis. The patients would still be infectious for the first week, so were told not to drink because they were more likely to have sex while drunk. This has since passed down and has become a "tradition" in a way. The main reason that people are told not to drink when on antibiotics is because doctors prefer people not to drink because it is better for them. However, the are some antibiotics like Flagyl which will make you vomit if you take them with alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Anxiolytics is too broad of a term to address. Alcohol is actually frequently considered an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiolytic#Alcohol" rel="nofollow"&gt;anxiolytic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Antidepressants, on the other hand, certainly &lt;strong&gt;can have adverse effects&lt;/strong&gt; when mixed with alcohol.  As far as drug interactions go, it will largely vary on the drug--without more information it is really impossible to say for sure what the answer is in your case.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, on a more broad note, the use of alcohol is generally perceived as counterproductive while on antidepressants.  &lt;strong&gt;Alcohol can contribute to depression&lt;/strong&gt;, so it is generally advised to be avoided while taking antidepressants. For more information, see this article: &lt;a href="http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/863.aspx?CategoryID=73" rel="nofollow"&gt;Can I drink alcohol if I'm taking antidepressants?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Both alcohol and prescription drugs (anxiolytics and antidepressants) can have a variable effect on one's alertness and reactions. Some people can drink 5 litres of beer and feel nothing. Many will feel dizzy and some will get near a coma.  Men tolerate alcohol better than women and some guys are very quick metabolizers, so they get alcohol out of their blood very quickly. The same reasoning aplies to drugs that act on the central nervous system. They have a sedating effect similar to alcohol and one may not feel one hundred percent alert while others may feel extremely sedated and unable to perform tasks that require attention and precision. For all this, there is always a warning about mixing alcohol with those drugs. However, effects vary a lot and you may get away with drinking and taking an SSRI such as Fluoxetine, Paroxetine or Sertraline. With a Benzodiazepine (Alprazolam, Clonazepam, Diazepam) you have to be more careful.  These drugs are more sedating than antidepressants and you may feel nothing, you may feel dizzy, or you may fall sound asleep.  One never knows for sure, so you gotta be careful. And do not drink and drive, even if you haven't taken any of these drugs. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;MD-Tech provided a rather good answer. I suppose in theory you could also add to it the risk of infection if you are drinking an unpasteurized beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Normally you would have gut bacteria which would prevent the yeasts from colonizing your gut, but if you have lost those bacteria due to antibiotics then in theory you could get an infection. Of course, if you're still on antibiotics, odds are they will kill the yeast.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer is fermented typically (but not exclusively) via yeast.  When live beer yeast, actually a fungus, is present, it creates a hostile environment for (potentially harmful) bacteria reducing their prevalence.  Therefore, fresh beer could be considered a safer alternative to say, river water.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's true. There's been big debates over to what degree they were aware that water caused diseases while beer did not, but a big factor was that beer was seen as nourishing (which it is) while water was not. In an age where getting enough to eat was a recurring challenge, this contributed to making people prefer beer/wine. In practice it seems people preferred alcoholic drinks for both reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Generally, people would drink small beer as an everyday drink against thirst (and that's what children got, too), and beer proper for celebrations. That's actually a Finnish saying: "small beer for work, beer for celebration" ("Kaljalla työt tehdään, oluella pidot pidetään").&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Small beer was generally made together with beer. That is, they'd do a mash, and the first wort that's run off has the most sugar. As you keep pouring water through, obviously more and more sugar is washed out of the malts, and the wort keeps getting waterier. Eventually they'd stop, and make beer from the wort. Then they'd continue, and run off a much weaker wort from the remaining sugar in the malts. This was the small beer. Many places they would even do a third beer, which was so weak it would barely ferment. There were also other grain-based drinks, made from flour or bread, and typically sour and just barely alcoholic. Kvass is the best-known example, but there were many others.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Weak beer as an every-day drink continued for much longer than you might think. It was the introduction of tea/coffee that first started displacing it. Then, later, higher availability of milk, then juices and soft drinks continued the process. On Gotland, off the coast of Sweden, children were drinking weak beer as late as the 1960s. I lack data for exactly when this ended elsewhere, but it was long, long after the Middle Ages.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It certainly doesn't keep the cold away or reduce the duration, but I'll be damned if it doesn't make you feel better drinking it. Mulled beer is just nice when you're cold, and when you've got the cold, the last thing you want to feel is cold.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Stews, casseroles, and chilis don't ward off the cold either. That doesn't stop people from eating ample amounts of them come autumn and winter. Neither do chicken soup nor porridge reduce the duration of a cold. That doesn't stop nearly every culture around the world from serving some variation thereof (or a mix of both, in the case of congee) to sick people.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, why stop there? Beer is nice too. All those things also help keep you hydrated, which can never be a bad thing if you're sick.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Basically, if it makes you feel better, it may as well ward off disease. I mean, it's right there in the word. Dis - ease. A lack of ease. If it puts you at ease, it's a remedy in my book.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;None, the hops are added to provide a bitter flavour and because they have an antibiotic property that favours yeast over other microorganisms.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The hops are filtered out in the brewing process so there is no calorific gain.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In a typical UK beer recipe the hops are typically 1% of the dry ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As everything in life, it depends.... From the &lt;a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/expert-answers/antibiotics-and-alcohol/faq-20057946"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Antibiotics and alcohol can cause similar side effects, such as
					  stomach upset, dizziness and drowsiness. Combining antibiotics and
					  alcohol can increase these side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;A few antibiotics — such as metronidazole (Flagyl), tinidazole
					  (Tindamax) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra) —
					  should not be mixed with alcohol because this may result in a more
					  severe reaction. Drinking any amount of alcohol with these medications
					  can result in side effects such as flushing, headache, nausea and
					  vomiting, and rapid heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So some antibiotics may not cause issues while others might. Best thing to do is follow the medications warning label&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Assuming no side effects, the alcohol can actually inhibit the effect of the antibiotic i.e. negating the effect. It would be as if you hadn't taken any, so it would affect your medication course. As it is, some medication does cause side effects and since most people don't read the leaflet insert in their medicine box, it's safer to generally avoid the booze.&lt;br&gt;
					Antifungal treatments can be fine, but no one right in the head would drink a load of vodka with paracetamol unless they were trying to end it all. Each drug is different.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer is a taste preference, and therefor the chances exist that you may "learn" to like beer. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a child I tasted the pale mass-produced lager that my father drank and I did not like it. But children (usually) prefer sweet over bitter.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As we grow older, our taste change and we learn to enjoy a more varied amount of flavours, including bitterness, and we then start to enjoy beer more.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another thing to take into consideration: There are MANY different types of beers! A person might love sour beers, but hate IPAs. Or prefer Bocks over fruit beers. It is a personal thing, but it means that, even though you do not like one style of beer, it does not mean that you will hate all beers!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a brewer once said: "If you have have not found a beer you love, keep drinking more beer"&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Adding any particulate to a beer will reduce the carbonation due to more nucleation sites and the flavor may change from the tobacco ash, but the only way to increase the alcohol content of a beer in your glass is to add alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not to be snarky, but there are as many uses for beer as there are people who use it.  I'm here because I use it, specifically high-hop/low alcohol (IPAs) as an alternate for sleep medication, since I don't want to be taking the same ones all the time.  (And though it's impossible to separate the sleep benefits, I think it helps with anxiety, not just at consumption time, too).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer, particularly the hoppy stuff, is known to raise blood estrogen levels. &lt;a href="http://goo.gl/qctfH3" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://goo.gl/qctfH3&lt;/a&gt;.  Frankly, though I'm no expert by any stretch, I'd say a (that's one) bitter IPA at bedtime is the perfect prescription for menopausal insomniacs.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There's so much to read about beer and hormones.  To each his (her) well-read own.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I don't remember much of the advantages of using beer in your hair, but it was &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNSCPod_Khk" rel="nofollow"&gt;popular in the 70s&lt;/a&gt;.  Variations across beer styles are much greater than variations across brands within a style, so if you know what style of beer you want to use, it should not matter much which brand you pick.  My recommendation is to go with the cheapest brand you can find within the style you want to use.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I will put forth my own experience.  I disliked beer when I was young.  It was not until I tasted ale imported from England that I liked it and sought it out.  I loved Samuel Smith's, Old Peculiar, Bass Ale, and others.  I expanded from there and sought out other beers and ales that were not your ordinary North American Lagers and found many I liked.  I quickly discovered homebrewing while perusing a used bookstore.  This was way before it was popular here and way before 'Craft Brewing' was a term that people knew.  I started to make my own.  Now I really like beer. However I still don't really like most of the big-brand beers.  And I don't drink beer as a thirst quencher.  But if someone offers me a beer - I am no snob and say yes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as DNA or genetically based dislikes.  I don't think there is a 'beer' gene.  There may, however be genes that make people dislike, or at least avoid certain tastes or aromas, or perceive these in different ways. These could then translate to dislikes of beer.  However, there are so many types of beers that this is probably very unlikely.  It would at least it's unlikely that beer would be the only thing that would be affected by this inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think a dislike of beer can be overcome.  Many people have notions of beer that are not really true.  A friend said she hated dark beer because it was too bitter.  I explained that this was not really true (that all dark beer is very bitter). So, I brought over some examples that were not bitter, but chocolaty, sweet, roasty, etc.  She now loves dark beers (most are actually not very bitter).  With some people it is really difficult to overcome these dislikes however.  But at least, in my opinion, most of these dislikes are learned.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would suggest the extra kick would be due to the fact that as you smoke the cigarette, you are taking in nicotine, which does enhance the effect of alcohol. So the effect is not coming from the ash, but the cigarette you smoke to get the ash.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8605457?dopt=Citation"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; research paper published in BMJ they concluded the following:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Results from observational studies, where alcohol consumption can be
					  linked directly to an individual's risk of coronary heart disease,
					  provide strong evidence that all alcoholic drinks are linked with
					  lower risk. Thus, a substantial portion of the benefit is from alcohol
					  rather than other components of each type of drink.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This argues that health benefits are alcohol related and not specifically beer related. This is, again, during moderate consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There's very little hard research on the healthful benefits of beer, though there is some observational research on both beer and (as Jens mentioned in &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/a/4731/37"&gt;his answer&lt;/a&gt;) on the benefits of moderate levels of alcohol in general.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's also been noted that there beer has a number of ingredients that are generally believed or known to be healthy, including vitamins, fiber, silicon, and others.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, while I wouldn't base a diet on it, moderate consumption of beer is at least anecdotally a reasonably healthy habit in which to imbibe.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While a doctor probably won't ever state that drinking beer is "healthy," doctors do provide advice on what "moderation" is. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Women who consume eight or more drinks per week are considered excessive drinkers. And for men, excess is defined as 15 or more drinks a week. (A drink is defined as just 5 ounces of wine, 12 ounces of beer or 1.5 ounces of spirits.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Moderation is around 1-2 drinks per week or per 2 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;All of this varies of course per individual's weight, current health, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer contains alcohol. Beer is addictive because some people are indeed predisposed to be an alcoholic. Beer drinking is no different than any other method of consuming alcohol. Yes, alcoholism is in your DNA. That's why some people get carried away with the allure of Beer only to find out that they are now dependent on alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer is alcohol no matter what people may think. Alcohol is a dangerous drug that happens to be legal right now. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are no proven benefits to drinking, bathing, washing hair or dishes in beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer has a reputation of being safer than whiskey, but the opposite is true.
					Both can kill you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;No, absolutely not.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Where this conception comes from is that &lt;em&gt;almost everyone&lt;/em&gt; who has their first beer drinks some of the worst beer out there, usually in their teens because they're surrounded by masses of other people who also don't know anything about alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So their first impression of beer is either a Heineken, Budweiser, Canadian, Guinness, etc, and &lt;em&gt;that's what they decide beer is like&lt;/em&gt;. People who want to get drunk continue drinking it and eventually acclimatize to it, and people who really don't like generics end up switching to sweeter alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The thing about beer though is that &lt;strong&gt;there is a huge variation in flavours and styles&lt;/strong&gt;. To try a Budweiser and then say "I don't like beer" is really saying "I don't like Budweiser". It's an opinion that arises out of the ignorance of what's available to the consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And so I'd argue that if almost anyone wanted to make an honest attempt to find a beer they liked, they would eventually find something under the enormous 'beer' label that they enjoyed. I've just convinced way too many people who thought they didn't like beer to start drinking it to believe it's at all hereditary. Psychological? Maybe. Genetic? No.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Alcohol free beer is not non-alcoholic, it does still contain some alcohol. It often contains around about 0,5%. A beer can be called alcohol-free from 1%.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To specifically respond to your situation I could not find any source saying that the Netherlands have an age restriction on alcohol-free beer. On the contrary the following sources indicate the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is also often seen as a gateway if you let kids buy bottles of lets say &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lH5hM.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Becks Blue&lt;/a&gt; it gets them in to drinking at a young age and as a younger body is still not fully developed it can lead to health issues or dependency on alcohol from an early age so it really comes down to not enough research on how a younger body can processes it and it is really hard to get that research done as we don't really want to be giving alcohol to kids &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here's a good link regarding yeast, now this article is talking about candida but can likely apply to other strains of yeast&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In a nut shell, a definite answer is not always easy to come by in medicine since many factors can give different results. Anything from the make up of your intestinal flora, your diet, to medications you take can have different affects that may be causing bloating or excessive flatulance. To answer your question, yes it could be the yeast activity but also it may be an intolerance to the yeast itself, also the bacteria in your intestines may not like the "new" yeast introduced and may produce additional toxins. Or  a combination of all this plus more.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Without getting technical, I think it really depends on the individual person just as much as the science behind it, hence the articles from previous posts. I have known females that will get extremely aroused just by drinking one or two sips of alcohol, this is due to the fact that these individuals actually had a very satisfying encounter with alcohol and sex, others may be put off if the experience was bad. I think quantity is key to sex and alcohol. Drinking alcohol impairs judgement and can make a person more out going and take more risk too much drinking can lead to passing out or getting the o' limp noodle despite the fact that you want to have intercourse. I guess there is not an exact scientific answer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your body takes a while to break down alcohol that is in your bloodstream. I believe it is 1 hour per 3%. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;During this period you will not rest, as your body is still hard at work.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hangovers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Primary causes are dehydration and toxins built up in your system from the impurities in the alcohol you've been drinking, but in my personal experience and research sugar content can also contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Dehydration&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Alcohol makes people urinate more, which raises the chances of dehydration occurring. Dehydration can give the individual that sensation of thirst and lightheadedness.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Impurites&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most alcoholic beverages contain small amounts of chemicals
					other than ethanol as a by-product of the materials used
					in the fermenting process (e.g., grains and wood casks). Congeners
					are complex organic molecules with toxic effects including
					acetone, acetaldehyde, fusel oil, tannins, and furfural. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Spirits have these in higher quantities than beer or wine due to the distillation process. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Sugar content&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Depending on what specific brands you are drinking and/or what you are mixing with high sugar content can cause you to have a sugar crash contributing to the hangover feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Quality&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In my personal experience the mornings after indulging with top shelf spirits are notably better than those done on a budget. Bargain spirits tend to be cut with grain alcohol and balanced with corn syrup contributing to the issue, but in general higher priced spirits tend to be more highly refined (Vodka for example tends to have more filtration the more expensive it is).  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;References&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I do this about once a month and can confirm that it's more than safe, it's delicious. In fact during the 19th century half of London lived on porter and oysters!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'd recommend oyster stouts, London porters or champagne with them. Stouts and porters are particularly traditional in London &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy wine, melon de bourgogne (aka Muscadet) or a chablis are a classic pairing for oysters. I also enjoy champagne or a Spanish txakoli with oysters.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You are confusing the issue with alcohol and raw oysters. Alcoholism can lead to liver damage which can predispose folks towards a dangerous Vibrio infection. So folks with liver damage (including alcohol abusers) should avoid raw oysters due to the risk of vibrio. Alcohol itself has no affect on Vibrio. The low alcohol content in beer won't sterilize anything anyway (it is the boiling wort part of the MAKING of beer that made beer a "healthy" option in the olden days :)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I heard this from someone in 1993 and his explanation was it changes the boiling point (which still didn't explain how it made the beer stronger).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;li&gt;There seems to be much "science" that would document that warm beer has zero capability to prevent a cold. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The question really asks why people "believe" that warm beer is successful in doing the job of preventing or helping the immune system of a physical body successfully deal with a cold.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;That "science" has so far failed to identify "why" warm beer or chicken soup is perceived by people as producing salutatory results is a failure of scientific vision. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would wonder this. 
					 - Is the immune system supported by the oils, liquid, and vitamins in chicken soup? If so, how is this accomplished. 
					 - Is the immune system supported by warm beer somehow? If so, how is the
					   accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I wonder if adding heat alone so the body can devote more of its energy to the immune system helps fight off the flue virus that produces the thing we call a cold. I wonder if the presence of herbs in beer helps the immune system in a way we do not yet pay attention to, or understand. Could it be, that at a vibrational level of frequencies, "home remedies" function successful to accomplish something that "science" does not yet understand. I do know that the Pentagon has used frequency science to deal with health issues via research done by Sharry Edwards per: &lt;a href="http://www.soundhealthoptions.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Sound Health Options.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have episodes of heartburn, usually from eating beef or potatoes and I find it very soothing to drink a splash of bitters in club soda.  I make homemade bitters with ginger, grapefruit, gentian root, and several spices that seem to be the most effective. Bitter herbal liqueurs are popular in Europe for before or after a meal to stimulate the appetite or aid digestion.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Gentian root is one of the most common bitter agents. While I don't know of any clinical studies, gentian root has been used in herbal medicine for centuries to treat digestive issues. It makes sense from an evolutionary perspective because bitter compounds are mostly found in plants and are often more or less poisonous. If the body produces more digestive enzymes in response to bitter flavors, the extra enzymes can neutralize the poison or extract more nutrition from the plant material. It's certainly not totally effective, salivary enzymes won't save you from hemlock poisoning, but it could reduce the ill effects of mild poisons. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm no expert but i'll give it a shot:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Jägermeister and other herbal liqueurs do contain herbal essences that probably have some effect on your body. But not in any medicinal quality, otherwise it couldn't be sold as food in the EU by law. There are strict rules (e.g. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_2001/83/EC" rel="nofollow"&gt;Directive 2001/83/EC&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In general the usefulness of digestifs for the digestion is heavily discussed (there are opinions that the alcohol takes away any positive effect the herbs might have). But i don't have any reliable sources at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And the alcohol is unhealthy, no doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So from a medicinal point of view: stay away from digestifs and stop eating too much so you won't need any digestion-helper.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From a recreational or culinary point of view: If you enjoy the taste, a digestif is a great closure of a good meal and the psychological effect of "believing it helps" works sometimes. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And i personally like the taste and drink it recreationally and not just as digestif ;)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Angostura bitters and club soda is a regular drink in my house. I find that it calms my stomach and just generally makes me feel better. I like to use a heavy dose of bitters--usually like 8-10 dashes--per 8 oz of soda.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When I have a nasty cough or a cold I drink Jägermeister to soothe the sore throat and to keep me from coughing every five seconds. I find it cools my throat and makes it less itchy. This works really well for me, a lot better than actual cough medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As happy as the above comments may make you, ashes in your beer is not a big deal and frankly, I'm amazed at the question. I tried your experiment of adding cigarette ashes into my coffee.  I have to say I was disappointed.  Besides seeing the happiness on the faces around me, I can't say it made any difference in the taste.  Now beer on the other hand may have a more profound taste change due to the ashes.  It really depends on the kind of beer and the type of ashes.   However, I do believe that if you like beer you might not even notice the ashes.  For example, if I'm looking into a beer glass and something is floating inside, I would be surprised to even notice it.  From the point of view of the ashes.  I can only surmise that they would prefer to go into an ash tray.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Answer: no, there is no change in taste in small amounts of ashes.  The more ashes you add to the beer the more of a scratchy texture but no difference in taste.  If you fill the whole beer with ashes you might find it milk shake like but bitter.  If you ever try that I'd like to hear your experirences.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.draft-beer-made-easy.com/carbonation.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; has very good information on how CO2 interacts with beer.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That being said, temperature plays a big part in the flavor of beer. &lt;a href="http://craftbeerrestaurant.com/Craft_Beer_Restaurant/Temperature_Guidelines.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Here is a the consensus of guidelines&lt;/a&gt; of what temperature types of beer and wine should be served.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There should be nothing wrong with refrigerating your beer and then warming it up. I really enjoy the flavor profiles in a lot of the darker, heavier beers I pour when they warm.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just make sure that you clarify what temperature your fluids need to be before ingesting with your physician.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As with all alcoholic beverages there should be no issues drinking them cold, warm or even hot. The alcohol pretty much kills any nasty things. There may be some flavor issues. Flavors are more pronounced when the liquid is warmer as the volatile compounds that make up the flavors are more easily released but that is not necessarily a good thing in terms of flavor. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Commonly known amongst bartenders, a remedy for curing the hiccups is to eat a &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/31/style/a-bitter-medicine-cures-the-hiccups.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;lemon wedge doused with bitters&lt;/a&gt;. (In case anyone is wondering... don't eat the rind. Bleh.) Traditionally Angostura bitters are used, although it's possible that Angostura's use is due to availability, for a long time it was the only type of bitters most bars carried. A caveat though, the lemon trick is only recognized for curing hiccups induced by drinking alcohol. I say it's still worth a try, no matter the cause of the hiccups. If the flavor sounds unappealing you can put granulated sugar on the lemon in addition to the bitters. Sugar has a hidden benefit too, it's a known hiccup remedy when taken by itself... and not just the ethanol induced ones.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Actually, there are studies that show moderate consumption of alcohol &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;WILL&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; help reduce chances of coming down with the common cold - if prevention is the key to the question...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, two large studies have found that although moderate drinking will not cure colds, it can help keep them at bay. One, by researchers at Carnegie Mellon in 1993, looked at 391 adults and found that resistance to colds increased with moderate drinking, except in smokers.
					  &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/18/health/18real.html?_r=0" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Claim: A Little Alcohol Can Help You Beat a Cold&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Drink alcohol in moderation as a preventative measure. Studies have shown that, while a cold cannot be cured by alcohol, moderate alcohol consumption can increase one's resistance to the cold. One study has shown that drinking 8 to 14 glasses of red wine a week has reduced the chances of getting a cold by 60 percent.
					  &lt;a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-Alcohol-to-Treat-a-Cold" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Knowing How Alcohol Can Help&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There will be a very fine line that's easily crossed when using this as a preventative measure... Alcohol dehydrates the body which can weaken your immune system - your body needs lots of fluids to keep up it's normal function. Binge drinking has been clinically shown to lower the body's immune response.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your body needs all of the fluids, nutrients, and rest it can get to battle symptoms once it's full-blown infected. So, drinking WHILE sick is generally a very bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With that being said, a shot of whiskey with lemon and honey might help relieve that sore throat and bring on that long night's rest that your body will be craving... Or, a warm beer (in theory.) Just the one, though!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There isn't going to be (or rather it wouldn't be visually appealing enough) a source for what you want. Your best bet is to search "::insert alcoholic family you wish here:: Infographics." When you do you will find that some people have made things like this from PopChartLabs! They have two great ones for Whiskey and Scotch too. &lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zDUpS.jpg" alt="BeerFam"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Apparently alcohol is not unhealthy if you limit yourself to a drink a day.  Life expectancy increases with moderate alcohol consumption however if you go far beyond that life expectancy decreases.&lt;br&gt;
					I rarely have more than two  to three drinks a month however in light of this information I'm thinking of increasing my consumption.  
					Whether the 50-plus Herbs in Jagermeister make it healthier or not I think it's a good place to start.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer can make you gain weight by three means, but you shall &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; pursue it !&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First&lt;/strong&gt; is alcohol, which is a byproduct of the fermentation of starch by yeast. Starch is a carbohydrate, and it has it's own nutriting quality, including energy. Its energy is transferred to alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the energy it carries is not used by basal metabolism or physical activity, it'll be stored. It is why non pathological drinker get fat. But drinking regularly may drive you to pathological drinking, even when you never get drunk nor make any excess.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second&lt;/strong&gt; is cereal malt (beer component) and non fermented starch itself : first is an aliment (cattle) and second is a carbohydrate : they are particularly fit for storing when unused.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third&lt;/strong&gt; is oestrogen. Hop, the flavouring and conservative plant used in beer production carries a phyto-oestrogen, which has the same effect on the human body as the feminine hormone. One of the effect of oestrogen is modifying the fat storage (many a women complain on her weight change under contraceptive pills), both for developing sexual character (women's are the sole primate with permanent breasts) and storing fat in case of starvation during pregnancy.
					You already guessed why messing with hormonal rates in your body is no option.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I strongly recommend you to seek help in gaining weight from a trained medical staff, or at least from a specialized Stack Exchange site. A change in your feeding habits may be way more efficient and less hazardous.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Basically, you must eat and brink more than your body burns, while making the right amount of physical exercise to gain muscles as well as body fat. Beer nutriment don't really matches the kind of food you shall seek with this objective.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sources: Wikipedia, French medical awareness websites, and my personal experience as a beer cellarman.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am pretty sure it gives you a kick but I don't think it's the one you are thinking of.
					I am interested in a more experienced answer because I went to a rural area near a village in a Mediterranean country recently  and they told me to watch out because guys in that area spike girls' drinks with cigarrette ashes so that they can get them more drunk or make them wanna puke so that they both 1) make fun of them and 2) can take advantage of them. 
					And there were some known solid incidents from the girls I met not just rumors so I'd say it does a good damn job. 
					I came across this because I'm looking for a way to avoid drinking something like that because that sounds like a freaking dangerous trap, but I can't find much.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here are some hard alcohol risks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hard Alcohol Risks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Hard alcohol consumption is contraindicated in certain segments of the population because of the latter’s higher susceptibility to the effects of the beverage. For instance, individuals who have difficulty sleeping, or suffer from depression or other mental disorders, are advised against intake as the psychoactive mechanism of the drink can further worsen said conditions. Consumption is also strongly advised against in pregnant women as it can lead to severe gross motor development, fetal alcohol syndrome, and sudden infant death syndrome, to name a few, in children who got exposed to hard alcohol in the womb. Persons who have to deal with chronic gastrointestinal disorders like irritable bowel syndrome have to steer clear as intake can severely aggravate the conditions as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;This beverage has a substantial concentration of ethanol per volume as well. Excess ethanol consumption inflicts sever damage to the liver and can bring about scarring or cirrhosis, inflammation or alcoholic hepatitis, and even cancer of said organ. This type of alcohol is associated with other cancers such as those afflicting the mouth and pharynx, the bowels, the breasts, the prostate, and the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Hard alcohol has a powerful diuretic effect as well. Because this is the case, individuals who have diarrhea, renal problems, or other medical conditions that are prone to severe dehydration must avoid consumption of this drink as well. Such fluid-draining effect of hard alcohol can instigate premature wrinkling of the skin due to dehydration, and may increase the frequency and severity of dermatological allergies like psoriasis and eczema. - &lt;a href="http://superhumancoach.com/negative-effects-of-hard-alcohol/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Secrets of the Superhuman Food Pyramid: Negative Effects of Hard Alcohol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These are just the tip of the iceberg, for drinking those extremely high levels of alcohol could lead to alcohol poisoning very fast and thus cause unconsciousness or even worse, death.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Alcohol overdosing is nothing unusual. It’s hard to come across anything beyond 40 percent at bars (unless on demand) because the higher the ABV (alcohol by volume), the higher are your chances of you getting knocked out. But still, there exists a dark land of spirits where ABV can go up to a suicidal 96 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spirytus Rektyfikowany (96% Alcohol)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The purity of rectified spirit has a practical limit of 95.6% ABV; this hard to pronounce Polish Vodka is a murderous 96% ABV. &lt;strong&gt;In short, abusing this drink can literally make you meet God!&lt;/strong&gt; Spirytus is actually more potent than the widely-known Everclear and sits atop as the world’s strongest alcoholic beverage. -  &lt;a href="http://www.mensxp.com/health/addiction/27309-10-alcoholic-drinks-so-strong-they-can-knock-out-the-manliest-of-you.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;10 Alcoholic Drinks So Strong They Can Knock Out The Manliest Of You&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Last I knew malt gave the most chance of gout. Whisky is less. Wine 0%. You can get gout from other ways as well (too rich diet).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have friends who has gout who still drinks beer, BUT you should be aware of your alcohol limit before you get the worst out of the scenario. Wine should be the best way for you to get the booze out of the drink. So watch out of the alcohol content before doing so, its no that I'm encouraging you to do so, but any limit due to your condition would not lead to NOT doing so. Better yet consult your specialist if you still have the urge to engage in drinking beer/wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The answer to this question is going to differ from person to person, since gout sufferers react differently to both diet and alcohol. For some individuals alcohol increases pain in gout sufferers, while in others it decreases their pain. One has to know how to micro-manage their personal diets and alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;For those who want to micro-manage their gout diet, you should know that there is never a single best alcoholic beverage. You know that your overall diet needs change at different times in your gout treatment plan. This applies equally to alcohol.  &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;You should know that the affects of alcohol are different for every gout sufferer. For that reason, I urge you to get a personal gout management plan from your doctor. - &lt;a href="http://www.goutpal.com/3344/what-is-the-best-alcoholic-beverage-to-drink-with-gout/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;What Is The Best Alcoholic Beverage To Drink With Gout?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Gout attacks rise with when your diet is high in purines. Purines are found in high-protein foods, and they are also found in some drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;“Beer contains a large amount of purines and has a strong association with gout attacks. One study estimated that patients who consumed a 12-ounce serving of beer daily were 1.5 times more likely to have gout compared to those without alcohol consumption,” says Dr. Sloane. Beer is especially bad for you if you tend to get gout symptoms because it is high in alcohol and brewer’s yeast, both of which may trigger gout pain.” - &lt;a href="https://goutandyou.com/gout-and-alcohol/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Gout and Alcohol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It seems that wine, whiskey or scotch may be a reasonable substitute for beer if drank in moderation or small amounts.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;“In a &lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140673604160005.pdf" rel="noreferrer"&gt;study published in The Lancet medical journal&lt;/a&gt; this spring, researchers followed over 47,000 male medical professionals with no history of gout for up to 12 years. By the end of the study, close to 2 percent of the men had experienced attacks of gout. Men who drank the most alcohol daily had twice the risk of developing the disorder as men who did not drink. Beer drinkers increased their risk by 50% for every daily serving, while those who drank hard liquor increased their risk by 15% for each drink. Men who drank wine did not appear to increase their risk for gout, although few men had more than two glasses of wine daily so these results are less conclusive. - &lt;a href="https://goutandyou.com/gout-and-alcohol/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Gout and Alcohol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140673604160005.pdf" rel="noreferrer"&gt;The Lancet Journal&lt;/a&gt; "interprets" their findings as such:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interpretation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Alcohol intake is strongly associated with an increased risk of gout. This risk varies substantially according to type of alcoholic beverage: beer confers a larger risk than spirits, whereas moderate wine drinking does not increase the risk.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Even though this study is in favor of drinking wine for gout sufferers, all alcohol consumption must be done in moderation and prudence as individuals react differently to alcohol and different types of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In general beer is not considered healthy.  In excess it is definitely not healthy.  Alcohol is hard on the liver.  Alcohol withdrawal has the highest death rate. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Up to 2 beers a day is generally considered a maximum intake.  You would pick up like 300 calories.  There are better ways to pick up 300 calories. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One pound can be gained through the consumption of about 3500 calories more than you burn.  If you drink a brand of beer with 200 calories per serving, it'd take 18 servings to gain a pound (assuming your diet otherwise negates your metabolism).  That pound, likely, would be fat.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I don't think you really want to do this, as enjoyable as you may find beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Limit: So, I would speculate that if you're "vaping" the same quantity of alcohol as you might instead drink, then you're facing the same risk. It's the same as drinking alcohol - the risk is cumulative and hard to define - it really &lt;a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/alcohol-related-brain-impairment" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;depends&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;how much&lt;/strong&gt; you drink and &lt;strong&gt;how often&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Effect on lungs: Frankly this is hard to say, as I am quite confident there have been no large scale (AKA reputable) studies (nor can I find any) performed on the effect of vaping alcohol on lung tissues. I would &lt;em&gt;expect&lt;/em&gt; the effects to be minimal, but then again, personally, I'd probably still just stick to drinking my alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I can't provide any scientific basis to this, but I am thoroughly confident that vaping is simply a fad or novelty to enjoy - think of the increased costs and lack of accessibility compared to just drinking alcohol - you simply need a bottle of beer and a fridge, or a bottle of spirits and a glass versus a specialised glass, tea candle, vapour catching vessel and a &lt;strong&gt;glass or metal straw&lt;/strong&gt; (seriously, who keeps one of them around?).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Brandy affects blood pressure in the same way that any alcohol affects blood pressure. In the short term, alcohol can temporarily increase blood pressure. In the long term, with too much repeated consumption, there can be long-term more permanent blood pressure increases. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In 1998, my VERY FIRST GOUT ATTACK came on after I decided to get into fine wines. Others may differ, but I will only have a small serving of wine as a toast or with dinner a couple of times a year. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Due its high alcohol content, you will still be able to drink the sake without worrying about your health.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, the recommended consumption period is usually one year after bottling. After that, the maker cannot guarantee the flavor of the sake. Whatever the flavor of your sake is right now, whether it aged well or went plain ugly, is not the flavor of the sake as advertised by the sake maker. Oh, and if the bottle is open, like wine, sake will oxidize rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sake may or may not age well, depending on the sake. I don't have enough knowledge to say what those differences are, though from my experience, old sake can become either a tad acidic or more rich in its original flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You may be able to sell the bottle so someone interested, but I don't think there is a giant market for it outside of Japan (though I may be wrong about that). In Japan, there would be plenty demand for old sake there.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;By law, there should be a date on the bottle (not sure if they print that on the box) which indicates the "month of bottling". Although, that law may not have existed 50 years back...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Note there is a chance it will go bad in the case it is nama (fresh) sake, which you can tell if you see 生 somewhere on the label. Nama sake is sake that does not undergo the two pasteurization processes after being made, so the yeast is still alive. Taste guarantee is only about a half a year, and something 50 years old will probably taste yogurty or cheesy.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I usually use either Jägdbitters (a Jägermeister-like bitters sold at Aldi) or my family's version of Bärenjäger (which I prepare at home - nope, it's not bitters, but it was also used historicaly for the same purpose), mostly when I feel a cold coming up due to catching rain.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Jägermeister gives a soothing feel to the throat if taken when you're already with the cought, but if taken as a preventive, it makes me feel like a warm blanket was dropped over my shoulders and I don't get the actual cold afterwards. It always works we me too, better than pharmacy bought stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ramazzotti, Italian herbal/bitter liquor. i drink a shot glass full of it when ever I have a stomach ailment. Works like a charm. And tastes great on ice and some like it with a touch of lemon in it as well. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I had 3 gout attacks last year. I used to drink lots of beer which was the cause for my attacks. I tried everything after the 1st attacks to replace beers but everything including vodka, wine, whiskey were triggering my attacks. 
					Great news is that I have been drinking dry apple cider regularly now and not facing any issues.&lt;/p&gt;
