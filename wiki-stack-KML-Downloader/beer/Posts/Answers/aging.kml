					&lt;p&gt;Aging, from my experience, involves the heavy proteins settling to the bottom of the bottle. Filtered beer typically doesn't need to be aged because all of that is already removed. You can consider this "pre aged" like a shirt may be "pre shrunk". Best not to buy with the assumption that it will get any smaller (or improve with time).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Much of the time, aging allows the beer to mellow out a bit. I find darker beers benefit from this the  most, but it really depends on the type of beer. Lagers, stouts, porters, have to age longer than pilsners and ales, as a general rule. But whether the brewer has begun or simulated this process is unknown. I guess it's best to follow the instructions on the bottle, or look up the bottler and see if they have recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Good question! I know that most (almost all) beers will not improve with age, and as you say will simply spoil. I don't know of any beers that you really want to age in the same way that you would age wine. In general, I would not age any beer unless it has specifically been presented to you by the brewer as something that should be aged.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Bottle fermentation or bottle-conditioning is adding yeast to the bottle at bottling time, so that the beer continues to ferment in the bottle. The main purpose of this is to carbonate the beer in the bottle, without injecting CO2 under pressure. I think most brewers do any conditioning before they sell their product, so you don't have to do this yourself unless you're homebrewing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's not clear to me why wine ages in the bottle, while whisky and beer don't. Any good answer would probably just confuse me anyway, with lots of mumbo-jumbo about tannins and stuff. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of considerations, although this is far from a complete answer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, a stronger (higher ABV) beer will tend to cellar better, as the alcohol can act to help prevent oxidization.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Second, a beer with less emphasis on hops, and more on malt, yeast, or other characteristics, will be a better candidate, because the qualities that hops impart will fade in a fairly short time.  This is why your IPAs and such should be consumed sooner than later -- the character is primarily in the hops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The purpose of cellaring a beer is to see its improvement over time.  Some may stay exactly the same, which others will change.  I think the answer there lies in whether there is still active yeast or bacteria in the bottle, and whether there is anything for them to chew on.  Some styles (lambics, for example) are far more prone to this, but I don't think there's a hard and fast rule that one couple follow.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Typically it depends on the style. High ABV beers, such as imperial stouts and barley wines will typically age well while others lower in ABV will go rancid after 3-6 months. Obviously you're not going to want to cellar a Bud Light (it tastes rancid anyway before storing it). But even when speaking of higher quality beers, you're not going to want to cellar witbeers, pale ales, and things of that nature which are rather light beers. It is usually best to ask the brewer if the beer is recommended for storing. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In terms of commercial beers, it is hard to say.  In general I find that aging tends to allow flavors to meld.  If I brew beer and do a brief aging in oak (or add oak chips), the beer usually &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; aging to achieve balance.  This is most typical with something I sometimes make called ebulon (non-carbonated, fermented malt and elderberries, secondary fermentation in oak for a month, then bottled and aged for several more months).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Extrapolating from my experience here, I would expect a few general rules to apply:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beers with disparate sharp contrasts (particularly where fruit are involved) may benefit from aging.  I could imagine things like full-bodied apricot ales aging well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher ABV and richer beers are likely to age better than lower ABV and lighter beers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is assuming you hope to see a general "smoothing over" of contrasts in an aged beer.  Some things will usually fade and some others may increase (for non-pasteurized or unfiltered beers, yeast flavors will usually increase).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You remember correctly. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/age-wine-wooden-barrels/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/age-wine-wooden-barrels/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NM6JH.png" alt="Tannic Acid"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;(Tannic acid, a tannin found in oak)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Tannins, the chemicals that are transferred from the oak barrels to the wine, are extremely good at forming hydrogen bonds (just look at the structure!), which makes them very soluble in water. Considering that both beer and wine have no shortage of water in them, these molecules are quite willing to join either substance.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for the aeration, I believe that may actually be an undesirable consequence of using the barrels for beer. However I can't imagine the effects being very profound unless you were aging the beer like you would with wine (months or years versus weeks).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;DIPAs generally have a high enough ABV (7%+) to age for a few months...but you probably don't want to.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most contemporary IPAs and DIPAs are best drank within 3 weeks from the date of bottling.  Stone's "Enjoy By" Series gives you 5 weeks to drink the IPA if properly refrigerated.  Super hop-bursted IPAs with a ton of aroma like Heady Topper recommend to drink them within 2 days, claiming the flavor and aroma begins to degrade after only a few hours if unrefrigerated.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One notable exception is Dogfish Head's 120 Minute IPA which is super high ABV and can probably be considered a barleywine for the purpose of aging.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Less intense IPAs like Long Trail's Vermont IPA could probably keep up to 2 months, maybe 3 with really good refrigeration but not much beyond that without starting to taste real strange and losing a lot of their floral and herbal notes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In short, the main factors in aging is a combination of compounds breaking down and oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;IPAs - hop aroma breakdown&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For IPAs, it's the hop aromas that break down fairly quickly - the aromatic compounds are volatile and break down noticably within a short timeframe:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Tom Nielsen, Sierra Nevada’s senior research analyst focused on hop
					  degradation, says that their research has shown that after about two
					  and a half to three months, hop aroma in a packaged beer, derived
					  mainly from beta acids in the hop flower, has already started to
					  diminish significantly. It’s a sentiment backed by Patrick Langlois at
					  Great Divide in Denver, brewers of notable hoppy beers including their
					  Fresh Hop Pale Ale, Titan IPA, and Hercules Double IPA. “Hops tend to
					  dissipate in three to four months, which is why that is the
					  recommended shelf life for most of our beers. 
					  (&lt;a href="http://beeradvocate.com/community/threads/how-much-does-keeping-a-beer-cold-really-help-retain-hop-aroma.6336/"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Barley Wines - Oxidation&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Barley wines are not hop flavor or aroma focused beers - the major hop component is bittering acids, so they don't suffer the same problem with aroma losses as IPAs. However, some of the bittering compounds also have a &lt;a href="http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;amp;pid=S0100-40422000000100019"&gt;half-life of 1 year&lt;/a&gt;, so clear changes are happening in that timeframe to the bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, the major change for a barleywine is oxidation. There is always oxygen in the beer - either small amounts introduced during packaging, or from oxidization during the mash, which is then later released into the beer. When alcohol in the beer oxidizes, it becomes ethanal (acetaldehyde) which is a main component in sherry, and gives apple or sherry-like tones, which in a big barleywine are considered positive effects of aging, if kept in check. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;Stouts&lt;/h2&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Contrasting with both IPAs and barleywines, Stouts that are meant for aging are neither hop focused nor benefit much from oxidation. Oxidizing the medium roasted malts in the wort would produce cardboard flavors due to production of &lt;a href="http://brewingreality.blogspot.no/2010/04/flavour-compound-of-week-trans-2.html"&gt;trans-2-nonenal&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, the highly kilned malts act as an anti-oxidant to help prevent the beer from oxidizing. What little odization does occur tends to produce port-like flavors.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The roasty character in stout comes from large Maillard compounds. These are still poorly understood, I can't find research to back it up, but I would guess the roasty character mellows due to the large compounds breaking down into shorter ones. This might explain why in some stouts the dark fruit flavors become more emphasized over time (since they are shorter Maillard compounds.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is an incomplete answer, but I know that there are some smaller bottles of "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_ale" rel="nofollow"&gt;old ale&lt;/a&gt;" beers which are made for aging.  In particular, there are several from the UK which are sold in the 200-300mL range, such as &lt;a href="http://draftmag.com/cellar/uncapped-44-25-and-4-year-old-thomas-hardys-ale/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Thomas Hardy&lt;/a&gt;'s.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm afraid that I can't tell you anything about the effect (or non-effect) of bottle size.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not really.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt;, larger bottles mean that the little bit of air trapped at the top of the bottle is smaller compared to the volume of beer than it would be in a standard 12 oz bottle.  However, I've been unable to find any research backing this up, and anecdotally it makes no difference.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Larger bottles are favored for aging beers mostly for practical reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Stores are more willing to sell a single large bottle (whereas many often require the purchase of an entire six-pack for smaller beers)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;It's easier to share a large bottle, which you often want to do with a good beer you're aging&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;They're often (but not always) cheaper than the equivalent beer split up between several smaller bottles.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But taste and aging-wise, there's no benefit to larger bottles.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I agree with the other answers: IPA's are not really intended to be aged like a barleywine. However, the style was historically brewed to survive the long journey by ship from England to India. So while they might lose some the freshness and hop volatiles over time, you can certainly keep them for many months and they will still be very drinkable. (Assuming, of course, that the brewery handled the beer properly prior to bottling).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, don't be in a rush to finish them. And never, ever throw beer out that you think may be too old without tasting it first. Beer does not spoil in the sense that it becomes harmful or dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are a few types of beers which are (generally) good to age.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strong Beers:&lt;/em&gt; like such as barleywines, robust porters, and imperial stouts. It is benefical if a beer is 8-10 percent or stronger, since an elevated alcohol profile will typically become smoother, mellower and more agreeable. That does not mean lower alcohol percentage beers can not be aged, but higer percentage beers are more suitable most of the time. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Malt:&lt;/em&gt; like Palo Santo and World Wide Stout. Darker, maltier beer is better because the sweet, residual sugars tend to soften over time. Even lower-alcohol beers with a malt-heavy profile will age better. &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wild Beers:&lt;/em&gt; living organisms change the beer as it ages in the bottle. Orval Trappist Ale is a classic example. The Belgian pale ale receives a dose of Brettanomyces yeast as it goes in the bottle. The yeast can live in the bottle for years, slowly consuming sugars and protecting the beer’s existing flavors by consuming oxygen. Over time it goes from being bright and hoppy to bready, earthy and spicy. But sometimes they are unstable, because the yeast rapidly works through a beer and alters its character.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What not to age:&lt;/em&gt; IPA do not improve with age. Hoppy beers are not for aging.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Quite the opposite, bottle conditioned beer is perfect for aging. The yeast carbonates the beer and will produce slight changes over time, like upping the ABV. This needs to be done in climate controlled environments similar to wine. The yeast will settle to bottom and you want to avoid pouring this into your glass when finished. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I brewed a Imperial honey stout and aged a few bottles at 68f for about a year for my birthday. The beer started at about 7.2 ABV The beer finished at over 9 ABV (this is because the yeast had plenty of starch to munch on and the carbonation was not affected. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In addition to Waitkus his answer I would like to note that the perfect time to drink a beer depends on the type, brand and most importantly taste. There is also a difference when storing larger bottles. For instance a 75 cl Duvel bottle (or larger) can be stored easily for several years, whereas the smaller bottles of the same beer don't fair too well. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Other beers, mostly heavier abbey beers allow for prolonged storing. For instance an Orval changes taste quite drastically once you have stored it for about 1 - 2 years. I've even seen these beers being stored for 30 years and still being drinkable (although you needed to pour it very carefully as there was a lot of cediment). The monks of Westmalle even have 35 year old beer on site for their own consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In regards to taste, they tend to become heavier, stronger in taste, sometimes a bit more sour. They also loose a bit of their carbonation (very old beers).  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Bottle conditioned beers definitely have longer shelf-lives than their pasteurized/filtered counterparts - the yeast helps scavenge oxygen and release sulphites to stop free radicals (such as from lipid breakdown) from staling the beer. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The yeast can survive for decades - Guinness &lt;a href="http://zythophile.wordpress.com/2011/03/18/bottle-ageing-beers-the-donts-and-dos/" rel="nofollow"&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt; yeast still alive in the bottle after 35 years!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;How long a bottle conditioned beer can be aged for and, thus how soon you should drink, comes mainly down to &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;the alcohol percentage - stronger beers age better, and&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;the color - darker beers age better than lighter ones&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While a light beer may be best consumed within 5 years, darker beers can be aged much longer than that. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;See&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I believe the general principal is that lower temperatures will result in slower (or negligible) aging process than warmer temperatures. The results will certainly vary depending on the ABV and other qualities of the beer. Storing bottles horizontally should prevent the corks from drying.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Remember, that not all of the beers are suitable for aging. Mainly porter beer can be stored beyond expiration date (30 years!), but some others too. And i see no point for aging beer in a fridge.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That sounds pretty much like an ideal place to store and age beer and wine. 65F is maybe a tad on the warm side, but nowhere near the temperatures that would actually cook the beer and be harmful to it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is no harm in taking the bottles out from the fridge and in to your "cellar". And yes, leaving them in the fridge will not be good from an aging point of view and yes, the corks are likely to dry out in the fridge.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It won't hurt the beer to take it out of the fridge.  Work done by Dr. Charles Bamforth has suggested that every extra 10 degrees Celcius of temperate cuts doubles the speed of beer deterioration.  So, if you pull them out and store them at cellar temp (~55 F), they'll age about twice as fast.  Dark is definitely good. Higher humidity vertical storage is preferential to horizontal storage in a bottle conditioned beer, as you'll want particulate settling in the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can see an interview with Charlie &lt;a href="http://beersmith.com/blog/2014/01/31/flavor-stability-in-beer-with-dr-charlie-bamforth-beersmith-podcast-74/" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the late response, but as I look on the internet for discussions concerning this topic I ran across this question.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the mid 1800's in England, IPA's were created and produced for multiple reasons. Long story short, as Europe was going through a technology renaissance period, ingredients used for brewing changed and grains that were converted into malt became lighter. Therefore, dramatically changing the "beer", that was much darker at that time, now into and ale. As this changed the palettes of many at that time they also introduced a great amount of fresh hops to these new ales to make a strongly hopped ale. The term IPA was introduced as a well known brewer(s) started shipping this new type of beer to India, giving it the distinct name IPA-India Pale Ale.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am providing this back ground to make a point. As this product was fermented, it was very typical to age and IPA Beer for a minimum of 1 year. This was done to assure that the beer was completely fermented and safe to transport on ships to India. This trip would take even more time and put the produced under various environmental stresses. This beer or "ale", was hopped very strongly and even topping the very hoppiest beer on the market in the U.S. today. Using the freshest malt as well as the freshest hops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My final point or argument is, that as I recreate the IPA and use fresh ingredients typical to a real IPA, I find that my IPA's last over a year in the bottle. As I drink them 3 to 6 and even 9 and 12 months the hoppy flavors still remain and even develop. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are many variables that allow me to get to this end result. This including yeast and malt selection, and also multiple methods that help produce beneficial fermentation, allowing the taste of the final product to be clear of flaws that would be created by the yeast during primary as well as the bottling (carbonation) period.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;After 30 years of beer making many of these truths become evident as I continually taste the final product, take very good notes and adjust my recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Finally, I can say that with the correct procedure of beer making, an IPA can be enjoyed at various stages from 1 week and even up to one year and can still be enjoyed for its distinct hop flavor and aroma.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would suggest reading "Vintage Beer: A Taster's Guide to Brews That Improve over Time" by Patrick Dawson. To summarize his findings on what types of beers improve with age they must contain at least one of these three characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;High ABV (8% or more)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Sour&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Smoke&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that if a beer has two or more of these characteristics the odds of it improving with cellaring go up. But even if it has all three characteristics it may not improve with age, or only aging to a certain point.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Plus you must remember that proper aging is also required. Proper storage, temperature control, how the bottle is positioned while being stored, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally I was quite taken with 60, 90, and 120 minute IPAs (thank you DFH) when shelved in cool and dark places for as much as a year. My guess is it would have been good for longer, but tasty beer and curiosity got the best of my experiment. I think Wayne in Yak deserves an up vote I can't yet do thanks to my noob status. Well researched and void of conjectural inaccuracy. If hops were the only flavor in IPA then yes it could be decreasingly "hoppy" but that's assuming we're referring to the aroma hops. Your bittering hops would surely deepen with time. But with any beer there are more layers than one. High ABV beers will just broaden the chord change more as every flavor will carry different in the changing alcohol/water/sugar levels that time provides. Fruit in the beer no matter its place on the sweet/sour spectrum (notably normally high point as well) have similar success on the "cool dark" shelf. This is due to natural fermentation of organic matter  stored over time. Ever noticed how fresh salsa gets effervescent in your fridge? Granted there are no chunks of fruit (or tomatoes luckily) in your beer so the effects are severely lessened. They weigh in on the scale equal to the alcohol changes mentioned above. A personal favorite of mine is a Scotch Ale stored for as long as you can wait. Hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Chemical reactions during a beer's aging are very complex, depending on a series of factors according to the beer's constitution and interaction between its components, as well as human perception of flavors. Certainly something way too complex to be briefly answered here.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I recommend you to read &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Patrick Dawson's Vintage Beer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; book. While it's not a extensive and deeply scientific study on the matter, I guess it's as best as you can get in a single literature nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Although some people have been aging beer for a long time, there isn't much formal knowledge about it yet, and most of what is known is from empiric experience and based on a lot of personal beliefs rather than strictly technical. But the book covers the basic.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer barrel-aging is a complex topic, and there's more than one reason for doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It has become a common practice in the american industry to age strong beers in barrels (mostly ex-bourbon oak barrels, but no only), to &lt;em&gt;mellow&lt;/em&gt; it and add another layer of flavors (almost the same thing that happens with whisky). It's very common with Imperial Stouts, for example, which is one of the styles that goes best with this kind of practice. Generally, boozy and dark beers are more suitable for this, but not only (people age belgian tripels, for example, which, while being sometimes boozy, aren't roasty at all).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, talking about oak, you get that vanilla, coconut, sherry flavors, sometimes some smoke from the barrel's inside toast, and things like that. Boozines is softened as well (mellowed). Off course, inside the barrel, a lot of complex reactions occurs, and I don't know how it can be compared with wine chemically, but, along with other compounds, tannins are incorporated to the beer, altough it doesn't always appear so much in the final product like in wines. It all depends on a series of factors, including the amount of time the liquid spends in the barrel.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Besides it, some aeration and in consequence oxidation does occur, but that's not the main purpose in that "type" of aging. Flavors of the original barrel's content may be picked as well, in higher or lower levels.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another main use of barrels in the beer industry is for production of wild/sour beers, in that case, the micro-aeration being a main desired factor. When people want to sour their beers and/or develop wild characteristics in it, they use different organisms after the primary fermentation. In order to sour it they use bacteria and for the rustic (wild) flavors they use another kind of yeast called brettanomyces in a further step of fermentation/maturation, in which oxygen presence is fundamental, but a slow pace is mandatory as well to avoid an overgrowth of the organisms and a possible "spoilage" of the beer. So, the barrel is a perfect place for this process to take place, because wood allows the oxygen to get in very slowly. Besides it, the barrel itself becomes a colony house for all those bugs (as brewers call those wild microorganisms), so you may not even need to pitch any yeast/bacteria after some time anymore. Off course, the wood alone impairs some flavors to the beer as well. You end up with a very, very complex product.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These days, people are doing all kinds of crazy experiments you can think of, and there's no mandatory rule when using barrels. It all depends on what result you want to achieve and real-world experience as well. There's a lot of methods, and every one is still figuring it out.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have not aged one yet (they only arrived in my country a month ago!), but I am sure it should age well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Due to the higher ABV it should develop some fruity aromas and flavours, maybe even go into the sherry-like arena.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you do age them, age them properly (cold/cool and in the dark) and try one every year. Certain beers age amazingly well in the beginning, but then go sideways after year 5, others you can leave for ages!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Aging or 'Finishing' is an extension of the maturation process, when the spirit is subsequently filled into empty casks that previously held other
					wines or spirits for a further relatively short period at the end of maturation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The selection of casks can affect the character of the final whisky.
					  Outside of the United States, the most common practice is to reuse
					  casks that previously contained American whiskey, as US law requires
					  several types of distilled spirits to be aged in new oak casks. To
					  ensure continuity of supply of used oak casks some Scottish distilling
					  groups own oak forests in the US and rent the new barrels to bourbon
					  producers for first fill use. Bourbon casks impart a characteristic
					  vanilla flavour to the whisky.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;so really the longer you age the whiskey the more of the flavor you are going to capture form the cask &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, we have to understand &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; we age whiskey in the first place.  It's primarily to extract compounds from the wood of the barrels (and any previous contents) so that they can add flavor and complexity to the final product.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From there, there are several factors that determine how long a typical aging period might be.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the wood in the barrels is new, or has been previously used.   Bourbon, which is typically aged as few as 4 years is aged in casks of new wood, meaning there are more compounds in the wood to be extracted, and they can be extracted more quickly.  Scotch, on the other hand, which is often aged from 10-25 years, is aged in previously used barrels, so it takes longer to extract the desired level of flavoring compounds.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much flavor you want the wood to add to the finished product.  A Rye, aged for 10 years, is going to have a lot more oak than you would want in say, an Anejo Tequila, which will often be aged for just a year or two.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of wood can have an impact as well.  Most whiskeys are aged in American or French oak, but if other woods are used, a tighter grain, or different wood chemistry can mean that you need more time in the barrel to the get the flavors that you want.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A true Scotch whisky has to be aged at least 5 years to qualify as whisky. Beyond that, the factors that change over time are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;colour &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;nose &lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;flavour&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The whisky takes on these from the wood, and from the previous contents. So for a really well rounded whisky, especially for a full bodies peaty, smoky whisky, that age is essential. That said, there are some amazing young whiskies, and some older whiskies that aren't as nice, so this comes down to taste,&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In fact there is a current furore in the industry about No Age Statement whiskies, as various blends are being sold off young, potentially putting the longer term whiskies in jeopardy as volumes will be necessarily reduced in the long term, becuase of a drive for shorter term profits...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The alcohol content &lt;strong&gt;decreases&lt;/strong&gt; as the &lt;a href="http://www.whiskymag.com/glossary/angels_share.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Angel's Share&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; leaves the cask over the years.&lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Way variable.  On the high end even from year to year the same vineyard and same grape will vary how long to hold. When it is released the vineyard and others will have a recommendation.  On the shelf at the liquor store is often ready to drink.  High end wine that is going to be put up is often bought out before it even hits the shelves.  Some wine that still needs to age does hit the shelfs.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wineries will typically hold some back to mature. Follow when they release it.  But that often goes to high end restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Answering myself. I didn't remember the beer very well as of the time I posted the question, and now I've had it again.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I turns out this beer is actually an english barleywine, even mentioned by BJCP style-guide as an example of the style. And, as so, it's (very) well-suited for aging, considering its high ABV, melanoidins and beta acids levels (english hops are high in beta acids, which age well, in opposition to popular most popular american hops).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'll get some bottles for my cellar.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Home brew here: I do German Hefeweitzen, or wheats. No preservatives. Did a dark one, went overboard on the dark malt, used 4 times as much as I should. Got something that tasted like a Guiness out of it. Not bad, but not what I was looking for in a dark German wheat. Put the bottles away in a dedicated fridge, a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Oh my god, the sugars built up! Just tried it for the first time tonight, to see if it was spoiled. I am now going to brew this one as my "one year old", as a special recipe. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can age a good, quality beer, at least under refrigeration. I am just learning about this. I am just consuming my one-year-old bottle of medium Hefe that I brewed last summer (my favorite recipe), and it is knocking a punch in terms of good flavors.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Even though you think this is a issue with certain types of mead during aging, I can't help but think you are just dealing with contamination that is turning some batches foul. I've never read of any type of mead that WORSENS with proper aging. So either you just don't like dry mead (maybe try carbonating it?) or you have contamination ruining your mead independent of what type it is. Alas, it is hard to find commercial meads to see what you actually like. Chaucers is wretched. I've seen some Scandinavian meads (like &lt;a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/19218/135533/?ba=Wobbly" rel="nofollow"&gt;Vikings Blod&lt;/a&gt;) but they are pricey ($30+ for a bottle) so I've only tried a few. Maybe there is a mead brewers gathering near where you live? &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://myplace.frontier.com/~mshapiro_42/meadmanl.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Meadery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Your Mead was great when bottled, but the taste has changed
					  dramatically for the worse after only a few weeks? What you probably
					  have is a vinegar infection. Smell the Mead and look for any hint of
					  an aspirin or vinegar smell. If you catch it right away, you can often
					  save a batch by treating it with sulfite tablets, but the odds are not
					  very good. You can only stop further damage, not reverse what has
					  already occurred. Worse, if a vinegar infection got into your Mead,
					  it's undoubtedly living in your brewing system somewhere. Go after it
					  with a vengeance. Sanitize everything post haste, maybe even throwing
					  out all of your siphon hoses (acetobacteria loves to hide there). Make
					  sure there is a good seal on your air-locks. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;If you have done all of this, and your Mead still tastes terrible
					  after six months, try again. Examine all of your sanitation
					  procedures, especially bottle washing. Make sure that any herbs or
					  raisins or whatever that you might have added were not a source of
					  bacterial infection. Most foul tastes are the result either of
					  sterilizer contamination or bacterial infection. If you used an exotic
					  ingredient, such as papaya peel, maybe you should try a new recipe.
					  Maybe aging will solve the problem, maybe not. At a meadmakers
					  gathering back in 1986 there was a Mead that everyone agreed had been
					  the meanest they had ever tasted just the year before, but which had
					  improved dramatically after a year of aging.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Oh, and another possibility that might slowly degrade your taste, from the same site:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;You don't want the Mead to sit on the sediment for too long,
					  especially in a warm climate, because the spent yeast will begin to
					  feed on the sediment (a process called autolysis), and this will give
					  your Mead an unpleasant taste. If your Mead takes a long time to
					  ferment, rack it every month or so if it keeps throwing sediment.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In this case you make be bottling too soon, or adding too much sediment when you do bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest determinants in how well a mead or beer or wine will age is oxidation. The only time that oxygen is beneficial is when your must or wort (IDK the currect term for unfermented mead) has cooled and you are ready to pitch the yeast. Oxygen at this point will help the yeast to multiply. But when the liquid is hot prior to cooling, and after fermentation is complete, you should be careful to minimize the amount of oxygen you are adding to it. Always stir gently and avoid splashing when racking and bottling. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You use the word "skunking" in the title. True skunking (as opposed to staling or oxidation) is caused by a chemical reaction between hop extract and light. If you are adding hops to any meads, be sure to protect the bottles from light by storing them in a dark place, preferably in a box. Sunlight and florescent lights are particularly harmful.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes, I have the general simple rule you are looking for: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Price&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The cheaper a wine is (especially for Cabernet), the earler you should drink it. But there are some underlying explanations to explain why.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Cabernet Sauvignon is built for ageing. It has very thick skin, high levels of acidity, and low sugar content. For ageing, tannins are good, acidity is good, and too much alcohol can be bad. The sugar in Cabernet Sauvignon has an alcohol potential of about 12.5%, against 14.5% for Merlot. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Tannins and acidity need time to soften, that is why a normal Cabernet wine from a respectable winery should need 2-4 years before it can be appreaciated, and reach its peak in 5-10 years. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The lifespan is shorter for lighter wines, for example in vintages where it rained a lot, the wine can be diluted and age a lot quicker. In these conditions the bottle may reach its peak in less than 3 years. This is also true for industrial wines who do not want to take risks and do not wait long enough for the grapes to mature, giving very light wines. If you look at Bordeaux wines, a 2010 tastes younger than a 2013. Because 2010 was hot and 2013 was very wet.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Over the years, wineries have developed some techniques to push the ageing potential further:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the Vineyard&lt;/strong&gt;: Planting vines in higher density (going up to 10000 plants per hectare in the Medoc region), performing green harvests, using only old vines, to get more fruit concentration.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the Wine Cellar&lt;/strong&gt;: Some techniques are used to extract the grapes and concentrate the wine even more. Pre-fermentation cold maceration has become a popular practice for example. Or some more extreme things exist, like reverse osmosis, which is used in some top Bordeaux Chateaux to extract water out of the wine. The less water there is, and the more dry matter it has, the more ageing potentiel it gets.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the Ageing Cellar&lt;/strong&gt;: Top red wines all over the world are aged in new oak barrels during nearly 2 years. Oak adds new types of tannins and anti-oxydants to the wine. This increases ageing potential a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Cabernet Sauvignon is especially famous for its affinity for Oak. The Oak softens the Cabernet tannins while adding more of its own extra soft tannin flavours. This way the bottle can be opened earlier than expected but also age until later than expected !&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;All these techniques make the wine more complex, and enable it to age longer. These techniques also cost a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some great Cabernet Sauvignon from the Bordeaux region should only be opened starting from 20 years after bottling, but will need around 40-50 years for their most complex aromas to show.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So in the end you got to know the techniques and terroir quality of the vineyard who produced your bottle, and the quality of the vintage. But that is usually reflected in the price of the bottle anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Being a former winemaker, Cabernet can made in a variety of styles from cheap Trader Joes Cabernet ready to drink the day you buy it, to Napa Valley cabs that won't soften up for at least a decade. In fact, I've had 20 year old cabs that were still so tannic, I don't think they would ever soften up.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From a winemaking perspective, usually I found that wines taste flat for several months after bottling. I think the introduction of Oxygen (not necessarily a bad thing) at bottling time alters the wine for a while, but with age things start to level out. For a high quality cab, I would wait a year after bottling for things to come around and you can taste full flavors. BUT, that doesn't really mean the wine is ready to drink. Usually several years after bottling cabs start to soften their tannins and become much more approachable. Not everyone likes that though, many people like a younger fruitier wine. YMMV. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is for wine that is stored in a temperature controlled environment and not on your kitchen counter. Heat makes the process speed up but not necessarily in a good way. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are no hard and fast rules about when you drink a wine. I would error on the side of drinking sooner than later because it's possible to get vinegar or a corked wine the longer you wait. If you have several bottles of the same wine. Sample one every couple of years until you think they are ready. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not knowing much about the beer but the 30 second Google search - I will try to give insight as to why this may happen.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've noticed this was a Trappist beer. As such, there is probably as much yeast in there as homebrew beers that have had sugar added to carbonize the beer during the bottling process. When too much sugar is added at this step, the homebrewing community refers to the disaster that happens next as "painting the ceiling." This comes from the present yeast having too much sugar to eat and over-pressurize the beer. The first time this happened to me I thought someone was shooting either in or right beside my house. I know that the Trappist Monks have been doing things a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; longer than homebrewers; but, the situation is still plausible. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is also a chance for glass defects. Or perhaps, the bottle was knocked over and created a stress fracture that over time gave way with your slight nudge. You could always reach out to Westvleteren XII Gurus and ask what is the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; way to store the beer so this doesn't happen again. Sorry for your loss! :(&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've been homebrewing and winemaking for almost 25 years and there are 3 reasons why a bottle might explode.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Too much sugar for the secondary fermentation in the bottle. Homebrewers do this ALL THE TIME. Turns your beer into little hand-grenades. Sometimes fermentation is not complete and with the normal addition of sugar at bottling can cause problems. This happens frequently in high gravity beers.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Infection - by this I mean something other than yeast was in the beer and started eating the sugar to make the carbonation in the beer. It could be a wide variety of agents from yeast to bacteria to fungus. They convert sugar to CO2 at different rates than yeast. Many times they produce more CO2 causing gushing beers and sometimes broken bottles.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Defective bottle. 99.99% of the time bottles are built to spec, but occasionally one slips through with a defect and many times that can lead to a bottle failing. Also, bottles are sometimes dropped or banged around causing a crack.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Any beverage that is "bottle conditioned," with active yeast, has the possibility of this happening.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In most cases, the yeast will be limited by either -&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Fermentable sugars already being depleted (not all sugars are readily fermentable to brewing yeasts)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Alcohol levels (this is the waste product of yeast) reaching levels that are toxic to the strain of yeast, and they either die or go dormant&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your typical home brew will go through fermentations so case #1 applies, and then they add just a bit of corn sugar and bottle so just a bit more fermentation occurs to carbonate the beverage in the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Other bottle conditioned brews might do an estimate of how much sugars have been used and how much remain, by measuring the specific gravity of the beer (more dense with sugars, less dense with less sugar and alcohol instead).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If their calculations were off, and there was still more sugars that could ferment, then pressure would build beyond what was needed just to carbonate.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I had a batch of stout where the yeast culture I used was pretty old, so it was less active than usual.  The time when I thought it was done fermenting was actually not accurate because of the less lively activity, and my bottles of stout all started exploding in my basement, and I had to dump the rest of the batch out to save the bottles.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I also had a fruit punch recipe that my uncle used for a wedding beverage, using just fruit juice, wine and champagne.  He used a much better champagne than the recipe called for, so there was live yeast.  When he put the leftovers back into the wine jugs and put them in the fridge, they got very "lively", with carbonation, more alcohol content, a bit drier, and one jug shattering from the additional fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Quick answer no. The yeast used should have very little effect on on the expiry date. Things that will affect this more are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Temperature of fermentation&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Hot side aeration&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Cold side aeration&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Pasteurization&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Filtration&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Colour of bottle the beer is stored in&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Type of beer ie % dark malts&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Live product vs sterile filtered&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This list is incomplete. This is an incredibly complex subject, there are PhDs in Brewing/Chemistry handed out for small aspects of each of these topics.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is a quick overview presentation of the technical aspects surrounding beer stability and stabilisation. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is generally preferred to store wine on it's side, but I think the climate the wine is stored is even more important. Generally, a wine like a vintage port, will spend only a short part of it's lifetime on a shelf in a store. I really doubt that even a year or two will dry out the cork unless the humidity levels are very low. One way to check if the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ullage_(wine)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;ullage&lt;/a&gt; level is low. Ideally, any wine that you want to age should be kept on it's side, in a dark, cool location. Moving the wine upright and back once a years is not ideal. Will it hurt the Port? I really doubt it. Port is pretty sturdy stuff since it's fortified. I wouldn't worry too much about it. The age is also a factor. If it's 10 years old, that's nothing for a port. If it's 50 years old, then I start to worry about it...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Right now I can think about some characteristics of a Sotch, that depend &lt;em&gt;partly&lt;/em&gt; on the age:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flavours:&lt;/strong&gt; The longer a whisky matures in a cask, the stronger is the influence of the cask on the flavours. So the character of a very young whisky largely comes from the distillery. That often means some fresh, fruity flavours, with a significant alcoholic taste. The character of an older whisky is largely defined by the cask(s). That often means some sort of wooden and softer flavours, besides other flavours that depend on the concrete cask.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Color&lt;/strong&gt;: Assuming the same cask, an 18 years old whisky is always darker than a 12 years old one, because the former had more time to absorb the color from the cask. (Ignoring the fact that many distilleries add caramel colouring before the whisky is bottled)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol and volume:&lt;/strong&gt; Over the years, the whisky constantly evaporates through the cask. Therefore, the amount of whisky in the cask is constantly decreasing (that's one reason why old whisky tends to be more expensive than young whisky). As alcohol evaporates easier than water, the alcohol concentration is decreasing as well.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm sure that a distillery doesn't use the same distillate for all products. But I have no idea if that means, that the distillate that is designated for an 18 years old whisky is crafted with more care than the one that's designated for a 12 years old whisky. Only differently, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Due its high alcohol content, you will still be able to drink the sake without worrying about your health.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, the recommended consumption period is usually one year after bottling. After that, the maker cannot guarantee the flavor of the sake. Whatever the flavor of your sake is right now, whether it aged well or went plain ugly, is not the flavor of the sake as advertised by the sake maker. Oh, and if the bottle is open, like wine, sake will oxidize rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Sake may or may not age well, depending on the sake. I don't have enough knowledge to say what those differences are, though from my experience, old sake can become either a tad acidic or more rich in its original flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You may be able to sell the bottle so someone interested, but I don't think there is a giant market for it outside of Japan (though I may be wrong about that). In Japan, there would be plenty demand for old sake there.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;By law, there should be a date on the bottle (not sure if they print that on the box) which indicates the "month of bottling". Although, that law may not have existed 50 years back...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Note there is a chance it will go bad in the case it is nama (fresh) sake, which you can tell if you see 生 somewhere on the label. Nama sake is sake that does not undergo the two pasteurization processes after being made, so the yeast is still alive. Taste guarantee is only about a half a year, and something 50 years old will probably taste yogurty or cheesy.&lt;/p&gt;
