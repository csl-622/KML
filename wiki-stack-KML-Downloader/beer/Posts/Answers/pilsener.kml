					&lt;p&gt;In general, you just want to store your beer bottles standing upright. For tons of detail on bottle storage, &lt;a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/101/store/"&gt;BeerAdvocate has a great guide&lt;/a&gt;, but in short: storing a standard shaped beer bottle upright minimizes the surface area exposed to air in the bottle, slowing oxidation, and preventing spoilage. Additionally, in the case of unfiltered or bottle conditioned beers, it's highly desirable that any yeast settle at the &lt;em&gt;bottom&lt;/em&gt; of the bottle - and not anywhere else. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've looked into this quite a bit; I was thinking of building a beer rack as a winter project. However, All my research tells me that beer should always be stored upright, no matter what variety, unlike wine which is best stored on its side. &lt;a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/101/store/"&gt;Beer advocate has an interesting article on the subject.&lt;/a&gt; For corked bottles, one does not want to impart any off-flavors from the waxes and other chemicals on the cork. For proper aging, it is also best that the yeast be allowed to settle on the bottom of the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's true that there are &lt;a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/human-biology/hangover3.htm"&gt;different types of hangovers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, those are mostly the result of differences in the impurities in the alcohol (that is, all the non-alcohol stuff that differentiates beer from wine from vodka).  And for those differences, it's largely the difference between different types of liquor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer is, compositionally, pretty much the same.  There might be enough difference between a heavy chocolate stout and a hoppy IPA, but between different brands of lighter beers (like pilsners), there's unlikely to be a noticeable difference in hangovers barring a weird food allergy to a minor element of one pilsner vs another.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some far more likely causes of your friends reporting worse hangovers for different brands of the same beer type are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Different quantities between evenings.  One evening you drank 10 Pilsner Urquells and the next you drink 8 Beck's.  How well are you really counting at that point?  If you think you had "about 9 beers" both nights, you might blame the worse hangover on Pilner Urquell.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Differences in alcohol level between brands.  The difference between 3.8% and 4.2% adds up after a while.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Small sample size.  Would you rely on a medical study of only 3 or 4 people?  Probably not.  Likewise, if your friend reports getting a bad hangover the last 3 or 4 times they drank Konig, it may just be a bit of coincidence, and they would have had a nasty hangover those nights regardless of what they drank.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Well, when it comes to very hoppy beers nowadays, I can't help thinking about American IPAs. It's not even close to any german style, off course, but if you are looking for hops, that's the one style to go for.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there are some german microbreweries making IPAs there, like Hans Müller Sommelierbier's Backbone Splitter IPA, Ale-Mania's Imperial IPA and Crew IPA. I just don't know how available they are over there.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In general, german styles aren't so hop-forward, favoring balance over excess. Styles like Munich Helles and German Pilsners have a definite hop profile, which I find just the exact right amount to balance malt and compose the aroma profile, but nothing overwhelming like an IPA. The rare doppelstick style (double altbier) has a high IBU count, but just to balance the malt sweetness, which is massive in this style, and not to stand alone.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Californian brewery Stone is going to open a production plant in Berlin soon, so their beers will be available when it kicks off. And, just in case you aren't aware, Californian beers = loads of hops. So, keep an eye open.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Try "Flensburger Pilsener", another typical Pilsener from Northern Germany. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Did some reading and found this site listing a number of microbreweries and beer gardens. &lt;a href="http://www.praguebeergarden.com/pubs/category/microbreweries" rel="nofollow"&gt;Pubs (Microbreweries)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And this place seems cool, &lt;a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274707-d4793505-Reviews-Pivovar_Hostivar-Prague_Bohemia.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Pivovar Hostivar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'd love to see if other people know about more cool beer gardens.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I was in Prague a month ago :-)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You absolutely must make a stop at the brewery at Strahov Monastery, &lt;a href="http://www.klasterni-pivovar.cz/index.php?process=34&amp;amp;languageID=2" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Klášterní Pivovar / Sv. Norbert&lt;/a&gt;, in particular if you're a fan of hops. I wasn't enjoying the beer in Prague until a local directed me here for their excellent food (yes, they also have fantastic Czech dishes!) Here's a photo of the beers I had—&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Flsx.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Flsx.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;—from left to right, their Wheat Ale, Amber Ale, Dark Lager, Summer Red Ale (my favorite, but seasonal only), and IPA.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There's also &lt;a href="http://www.praguebeermuseum.com/en" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Prague Beer Museum&lt;/a&gt; near Old Town, a few blocks northeast of the famous astronomical clock tower. The name's a little misleading—it's just a beer garden with some bar food (not great). Most of the beers were lagers (pilsners, dark), with a few IPAs and other styles scattered about. I wasn't a huge fan of their selection, but perhaps I was being closed-minded. Relative to San Diego standards, their one porter on draft tasted more like barleywine (...unaged, blegh), their one pale ale tasted skunky to me, and their IPAs tasted like they were afraid to use too much hops :-) If you check it out and have a different experience, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And also don't hesitate to self-answer your question after your travels, especially if you've found breweries or pubs not mentioned here.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Below, the first of 3 flights I ordered at Prague Beer Museum.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g5CLL.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g5CLL.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am from Prague and sure, there are many microbreweries here.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It sure depends what part of city you are in, but here are some of my personal tips (overall, the more to the city center, the more expensive it is)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;City center - &lt;a href="http://www.npivovar.cz/en/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Novomestsky pivovar&lt;/a&gt; - mostly for tourists I would say&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;City center - &lt;a href="http://www.pivovarskydum.com/index/index/lang/en" rel="nofollow"&gt;Pivovarsky dum&lt;/a&gt; - popular among locals as well&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;City center - &lt;a href="http://en.ufleku.cz/" rel="nofollow"&gt;U Fleku&lt;/a&gt; - very popular among tourists, nice atmosphere, not very cheap though&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;North of Prague - &lt;a href="http://www.pivovarubulovky.cz/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Pivovar U Bulovky&lt;/a&gt; - nice small brewery, locals mainly, near tram&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;North of Prague - &lt;a href="http://www.pivovarkolcavka.cz/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Pivovar Kolčavka&lt;/a&gt; - very nice brewery, good food, locals mainly, close to Palmovka Metro (underground)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Southern Prague - &lt;a href="http://www.jihomestskypivovar.cz/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jihomestsky pivovar&lt;/a&gt; - again, very good beer and food, near Metro Háje&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Southern Prague - &lt;a href="http://www.pivovar-hostivar.cz/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Pivovar Hostivar&lt;/a&gt; - one of the best gardens, nice beer and food, only about two years old, quite far from Metro (Hostivar or Haje)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And sure much more, but these are some of those I remember or have experienced myself.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can ask for anything in particular, if you want.
					Enjoy your stay in Prague :)
					Zax&lt;/p&gt;
