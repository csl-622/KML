					&lt;p&gt;It seems as though lighter beers are the most popular:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;In northern Germany, a half-and-half made of Pilsner beer and lemon soda is known as an Alster&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;In southern Germany, a mix of Weißbier and lemon soda is called a "Russ'" (Russian).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The Radler (cyclist) Biermischgetränk has a long history in German-speaking regions. It consists of a 80:20 or 70:30 mixture of beer and German-style lemonade (not American-style lemonade, but sparkling lemon soda, similar but not identical to Sprite or 7 Up).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandy"&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In general, shandies are meant to be "refreshing" drinks, so the lighter beers makes sense.  You can get creative with dark or hoppy beers, but in general you want lighter brews like pilsners, saisons, golden ales, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've had the Leinenkugel's Orange Shandy recently, which I liked.  Most shandys (shandies?) seem to be lemon, this one was orange.  I think using orange and something with a distinctly Belgian taste instead of a basic pilsner could be interesting.  Think Blue Moon which everybody puts a slice of orange in anyway. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From what I understand, Shandies as we see them now are more similar to the German Radler.  Radler means cyclist in German.  The way I understand the story is that a small pub owner was besieged one day by a slew of thirsty cyclists and knew that his beer supply wouldn't hold out, so he cut it by mixing it with some sort of lemon drink he had on hand.  As far as I know this origin story isn't confirmed and Radler likely grew out of folk attempts to "sessionize" and extend the supply of leftover lager through the summer when lower alcohol and more refreshing drinks were wanted.  According to wikipedia the first printed mention of Radler as a drink was in 1912: &lt;a href="http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/4594/20" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Lena Christ: Erinnerungen einer Überflüssigen - Kapitel 20&lt;/a&gt;. I believe contemporary Radlers use a lemon-soda sort of drink that's more like a carbonated lemonade than what we'd think of as soda.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Shandy itself is short for Shandygaff which is a British English term from the mid-1800s referring to beer cut with ginger beer or ginger ale. In fact, the OED still defines it as such while Mariam-Webster has loosened it up and allows for any non-alcoholic drink to be used in place of ginger.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As to their reputation, if you'll forgive me a little supposition, most commercial shandies are very pale duplications of mixing lemonade (or lemon soda) with a beer yourself.  The first commercial example I saw was Lienenkugel's and it was abusively sweet.  Sam Adams and The Traveler have fared a little better, but I think a major problem is that to commercially produce a shandy you need to heavily filter and pasteurize the beer and lemonade  to make sure the sugar doesn't ferment or use a non-fermentable sugar, which would change the taste from fresh beer and fresh lemonade.  At the scale a lot of breweries operate at, it possible some of them aren't even using real lemonade regardless of sugar type.  Also, while continuously popular in Europe, beer cocktails never caught on or were lost in America and we tend to think of them now as marketing gimmicks by macro-brewers (Bud Light Lime, Bud Chelada, Miller Chill), though as they become more visible, I think they'll become more accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, fresh shandy is incredible, I like using wheat beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Shandies or Biermischgetränke (German for beer mixed drinks) are almost as old as beer itself. Recently I visited one of the oldest breweries in Czech Republic and they did tell stories of how their beers mixed well with juices as early as 18th century. Although documentation standing to the rigours of science is not available to my knowledge.
					Actually Shandies have a very good reputation amongst the regulars, especially women as everyone cannot palate the bitterness of beers. Shandies are known to keep the soul of beer without the bitterness of their character. 
					The 'bad reputation' is with critics who look for remnant taste of beer; which is very unfair to the Shandy because it is after all a distinct personality, not an adjunct to beer. It is a cocktail; not a beer.&lt;/p&gt;
