					&lt;p&gt;Bourbon is a type of whiskey, whereas not all whiskies are bourbons!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.diffen.com/difference/Bourbon_vs_Whiskey"&gt;Bourbon&lt;/a&gt; is a type of whiskey that gets its name from Bourbon County, Kentucky, where it originated. Bourbon tends to be amber-colored, and a little sweeter and heavier in texture than other whiskeys. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What make a bourbon a bourbon and not just an ordinary whiskey? The following is from Men's Journal: &lt;a href="http://www.mensjournal.com/food-drink/drinks/what-exactly-is-the-difference-between-bourbon-and-whiskey-20140905"&gt;What, Exactly, Is the Difference Between Bourbon and Whiskey?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The most popular form of American whiskey is bourbon, which has its own specific definition. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;"Bourbon needs to be produced in America and made from 51 percent corn, and whisky does not," says Maker's Mark Master Distiller Greg Davis. Bourbon also needs to be stored in new charred-oak barrels, whereas whiskey barrels do need to be oak but not new or charred. "Lastly, to be called bourbon, the liquid needs to be distilled to no more than 160 proof and entered into the barrel at 125." For other whiskies the liquid must be distilled to no more than 190 proof. David notes that this isn't just common practice — "it's actual bourbon law."  &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Makes a Bourbon: A Cheat Sheet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Must be made in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Must contain 51 percent corn.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Must be aged in new oak charred barrels.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Must be distilled to no more than 160 proof and entered into the barrel at 125 proof.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Must be bottled at no less than 80 proof.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;•Must not contain any added flavoring, coloring or other additives.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The following is taken from &lt;a href="http://www.diffen.com/difference/Bourbon_vs_Whiskey"&gt;Bourbon vs. Whiskey:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Somewhat like champagne isn't champagne unless it's made in Champagne, France, Bourbon is not actually "Bourbon" if it is made outside the USA, even though other whiskeys may adhere to the same recipe and distillation guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tennessee Whiskey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The legal requirements for whiskey to be called Tennessee Whiskey are that the whiskey should be: &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;-distilled in Tennessee &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;-made from at least 51% corn &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;-filtered through maple charcoal, and &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;-aged in new, charred oak barrels.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;This is the process by which Jack Daniel's is manufactured. The company is the largest whiskey producer in Tennessee and wields an outsize influence on liquor laws in the state; they lobbied the state legislature to create such stringent requirements for labeling Tennessee Whiskey. Other whiskey producers in the state, including UK-based Diageo that owns Tennessee's No. 2 whiskey distiller George Dickel, oppose these criteria and are lobbying to have them loosened. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some consider Tennessee Whiskey a Bourbon, while most do not. The fact remains that both Tennessee Whiskey and Jack Daniel's are filtered through maple charcoal making them a different product. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addendum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is scotch?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The main difference between &lt;a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/30278/what%E2%80%99s-difference-between-scotch-whiskey-and-bourbon"&gt;scotch&lt;/a&gt; and whisky is geographic, but also ingredients and spellings. Scotch is whisky made in Scotland, while bourbon is whiskey made in the U.S.A, generally Kentucky. Scotch is made mostly from malted barley, while bourbon is distilled from corn. If you’re in England and ask for a whisky, you’ll get Scotch. But in Ireland, you’ll get Irish whiskey (yep, they spell it differently for a little colour).&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long should &lt;a href="http://www.scotch-whisky.org.uk/understanding-scotch/faqs/"&gt;Scotch Whisky&lt;/a&gt; be aged?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;It is not possible to lay down any precise age as being the best for a particular whisky. Generally speaking, Malt Whiskies require longer to mature fully than Grain Whiskies. UK and EU law insist that Scotch Whisky should be at least three years old. However, it is the practice of the trade to mature for substantially longer than the legal minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is rye?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thrillist.com/vice/rye-vs-bourbon-vs-scotch-whiskey-types-explained-guide-to-different-types-of-whisky-whiskey"&gt;Rye whisky&lt;/a&gt;, like its name suggests, is a whiskey that is distilled from at least 51% rye. What is rye? Rye is a type of grass that is a member of the wheat tribe and closely related to barley. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canadian whisky&lt;/strong&gt; is simply a rye whisky.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_whiskey#Legal_requirements" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; is a great resource.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The Federal Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits (27 C.F.R. 5) state 
					  that bourbon made for U.S. consumption[18] must be:&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;ul&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Produced in the United States[19]&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Made from a grain mixture that is at least 51% corn[20]&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Aged in new, charred oak barrels[20]&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Distilled to no more than 160 (U.S.) proof (80% alcohol by volume)[20]&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Entered into the barrel for aging at no more than 125 proof (62.5% alcohol by volume)[20]&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;Bottled (like other whiskeys) at 80 proof or more (40% alcohol by volume)[21]&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ul&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Daniel%27s" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jack Daniel's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The product meets the regulatory criteria for classification as a straight 
					  bourbon, though the company disavows this classification and markets it simply 
					  as Tennessee whiskey rather than as Tennessee bourbon.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The differences between &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; drinks (&lt;em&gt;"made for U.S. consumption"&lt;/em&gt;), and the difference between whiskey and bourbon are two separate questions (the former has been well answered).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's probably "barrel char" which is the inside of the barrel that was carbonized or "charred". Charred wood is pretty flaky and comes off easily. Sometimes this gets filtered out and sometimes the maker doesn't do a perfect job. Either way, if it's been soaking in alcohol for many years, it's probably not going to hurt you at this point!&lt;/p&gt;

					  &lt;p&gt;So why is bourbon so sweet?&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;It’s all about the corn mash. The stuff those geniuses ferment.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Bourbon’s mashbill is made of at least 51% corn, often far more
					  (closer to 70% as an average). Four Roses has two mashbills, one with
					  60% corn and one with 75% corn. There are various high-rye, low-rye,
					  wheat and whatever else mashbills but all share one characteristic –
					  at least 51% corn.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Scotch, on the other hand, uses mostly or all barley in its mash and
					  the glucose content of corn is much higher. That glucose is what gives
					  bourbon its easily recognizable sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;51%+ corn in the mash is why bourbon is so sweet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scotchaddict.com/bourbon-sweet.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Why is bourbon so sweet?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Many chemical compounds, like saccharin for example, can taste sweet. There are hundreds of chemical compounds in bourbon and a number of them or combinations of them can lead to that sense of sweetness. Ethanol itself has a sweet flavor. The sugar from the corn itself however, will not make it through the distillation process. If we consider for a moment corn based vodka, you'll notice that it doesn't have the same sweet flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'd say that what sets bourbon apart is the number of chemical compounds present, collectively adding to the sweetness. An important contributor to these compounds are the flavors that come from the barrel, most noticeably vanillin. Vanillin tastes like, well..... vanilla. Another is &lt;a href="http://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/data/rw1029501.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;3-Methyl-4-octanolide&lt;/a&gt;, also known as whisky lactone, which adds more vanilla flavor as well as coconut. The other major contributor are esters. Esters are one of the congeners, things other than ethanol that make it through distillation. Esters add more fruit flavors. One such ester is &lt;a href="http://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/data/rw1004811.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;ethyl hexanoate&lt;/a&gt;, which can provide like a pineapple or slightly green banana flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can actually get totally different compounds in the bottle while using the exact same production materials too. For example in the barrel, a lower alcohol content &lt;a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2012/03/what-makes-makers-mark-taste-like-makers.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;won't penetrate the wood as deeply&lt;/a&gt; as a higher alcohol content would. The sweeter flavors are pretty shallow in the wood so if I wanted to make something sweet, I'd dilute the alcohol a little before aging. You won't be able to tell this by looking at the alcohol content on the bottle though, because the higher proof stuff going into the barrel will be diluted after aging. It's all part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I did not see this mentioned...wood is made up of fibers of cellulose and hemicellulose. Both of these substances are polymers of sugar, just like starch is a polymer of sugar. When the barrel is charred, it will create caramel compounds, just like charring sugar. When bourbon is stored in a charred oak barrel, these caramel compounds will be extracted into the spirit, adding sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the cellulose and hemicellulose are bound together by a compound called lignin. When lignin is broken down, phenylpropenes and methoxyphenols are created. Examples of these compounds are vanilla and clove flavors&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Bourbon is not different from whiskey...it is to be understood that "bourbon" is a type of whiskey which is distilled in America (USA) this is the answer in laymen language... Try to understand the idea that "scotch" is also a whiskey which is distilled in scotland... 
					So be it scotch, bourbon, rye they all are whiskey but the difference lies in their constituent ingredient (barley, corn)...blended or single malted... Origin place, taste and texture anf lastly the alcohol content... 
					Asking the difference between  "bourbon and whiskey" is just like asking the difference between "BMW and a CAR"
					I hope you get the idea.. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bourbon and scotch are types of whiskey and cognac is a variety of brandy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bourbon is a type of whiskey, whereas not all whiskies are bourbons!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.diffen.com/difference/Bourbon_vs_Whiskey" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Bourbon&lt;/a&gt; is a type of whiskey that gets its name from Bourbon County, Kentucky, where it originated. Bourbon tends to be amber-colored, and a little sweeter and heavier in texture than other whiskeys.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Scotch?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;

					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are whiskeys?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Whisky or whiskey is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash. Various grains (which may be malted) are used for different varieties, including barley, corn (maize), rye, and wheat. Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks, generally made of charred white oak. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Whisky is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types. The typical unifying characteristics of the different classes and types are the fermentation of grains, distillation, and aging in wooden barrels. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Whisky (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brandies&lt;/strong&gt; are not whiskeys, but is a spirit produced by distilling &lt;strong&gt;wine&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Brandy is a spirit produced by distilling wine. Brandy generally contains 35–60% alcohol by volume (70–120 US proof) and is typically drunk as an after-dinner digestif. Some brandies are aged in wooden casks, others are coloured with caramel colouring to imitate the effect of aging, and some are produced using a combination of both aging and colouring. Varieties of wine brandy can be found across the winemaking world. Among the most renowned are Cognac and Armagnac from southwestern France. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandy" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Brandy (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Cognac?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Cognac is a variety of brandy named after the town of Cognac, France. It is produced in the surrounding wine-growing region in the departments of Charente and Charente-Maritime. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Cognac production falls under French Appellation d'origine contrôlée designation, with production methods and naming required to meet certain legal requirements. Among the specified grapes Ugni blanc, known locally as Saint-Emilion, is most widely used.&lt;a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/30278/what%E2%80%99s-difference-between-scotch-whiskey-and-bourbon" rel="noreferrer"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; The brandy must be twice distilled in copper pot stills and aged at least two years in French oak barrels from Limousin or Tronçais. Cognac matures in the same way as whiskies and wine barrel age, and most cognacs spend considerably longer "on the wood" than the minimum legal requirement. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The white wine used in making cognac is very dry, acidic and thin. Though it has been characterized as "virtually undrinkable",&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandy" rel="noreferrer"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; it is excellent for distillation and aging. It may be made only from a strict list of grape varieties. In order for it to be considered a true cru, the wine must be at least 90% Ugni blanc (known in Italy as Trebbiano), Folle blanche and Colombard, while up to 10% of the grapes used can be Folignan, Jurançon blanc, Meslier St-François (also called Blanc Ramé), Sélect, Montils or Sémillon.&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armagnac_(brandy)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; Cognacs which are not to carry the name of a cru are freer in the allowed grape varieties, needing at least 90% Colombard, Folle blanche, Jurançon blanc, Meslier Saint-François, Montils, Sémillon, or Ugni blanc, and up to 10% Folignan or Sélect. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognac" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Cognac (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Armagnac brandy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Armagnac is a distinctive kind of brandy produced in the Armagnac region in Gascony, southwest France. It is distilled from wine usually made from a blend of grapes including Baco 22A, Colombard, Folle blanche and Ugni blanc, traditionally using column stills rather than the pot stills used in the production of cognac. The resulting spirit is then aged in oak barrels before release. Production is overseen by the Institut national de l'origine et de la qualité (INAO) and the Bureau National Interprofessionel de l'Armagnac (BNIA). - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armagnac_(brandy)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Armagnac (brandy)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One last note. There also exists a liquor that is generally known as &lt;strong&gt;fruit brandy&lt;/strong&gt; and is quite popular in various regions around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_brandy" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Fruit brandy&lt;/a&gt; or fruit spirit&lt;a href="https://www.diffen.com/difference/Bourbon_vs_Whiskey" rel="noreferrer"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; is a distilled beverage produced from mash, juice, wine or residues of culinary fruits. The term covers a broad class of spirits produced across the world, and typically excludes beverages made from grapes, which are referred to as plain brandy (when made from distillation from wine) or pomace brandy (when made directly from grape pomace). Apples, pears, apricots, plums and cherries are the most commonly used fruits. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;According to a legal definition in the United States, a "fruit brandy" is distilled "solely from the fermented juice or mash of whole, sound, ripe fruit, or from standard grape, citrus, or other fruit wine, with or without the addition of not more than 20 percent by weight of the pomace of such juice or wine, or 30 percent by volume of the lees of such wine, or both."&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;In the European Union, fruit brandies may not be labeled as "fruit brandy"; instead, the legal English denomination is fruit spirit, which is "produced exclusively by the alcoholic fermentation and distillation of fleshy fruit or must of such fruit, berries or vegetables, with or without stones".&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandy" rel="noreferrer"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; A great number of European fruit brandies have a protected designation of origin, and are labeled with their respective protected names instead of "fruit spirit" ("apricot spirit", etc.). Cider spirit and perry spirit (fruit brandy distilled from cider or perry) form a separate legal category. Some fruit spirits may be labeled with alternative names such as kirsch (cherry spirit) or slivovitz (plum spirit) regardless their country of origin.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;In British usage, "fruit brandy" may also refer to liqueurs obtained by maceration of whole fruits, juice or flavoring in a distilled beverage, and such liqueurs are legally labeled as "cherry brandy", "apricot brandy" etc. all across the European Union.&lt;a href="https://www.diffen.com/difference/Bourbon_vs_Whiskey" rel="noreferrer"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; Such beverages are used similar to cordials, and as an ingredient in cocktails and cakes. Fruit brandies obtained by distillation are often referred by the French term eau de vie.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Fruit brandy usually contains 40% to 45% ABV (80 to 90 US proof). It is often colourless. Fruit brandy is customarily drunk chilled or over ice, but is occasionally mixed. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The answer above nails the quantitative parts of the question, but I'll spend a little time adding a qualitative answer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In terms of flavour and the experience while drinking, Brandy and Whisky are quite similar. If you gave a taste test to a beginner they could easily mistake one for the other.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;At the same time, though, someone who was well versed in both liquors could likely distinguish between the two a majority of the time. While there are whiskies out there which border on cloying, brandy usually tends to be sweeter than most whiskies.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, the flavour profiles for whisky are also much broader. That is, you're likely to see much more variation in the qualitative aspects of whisky than you are brandy.&lt;/p&gt;
