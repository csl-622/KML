					&lt;p&gt;You're speaking of Utah, I assume, the only state I've been to that has laws like that. I know you can achieve lower alcohol content by using less yeast, or sugar, or both, since alcohol in beer is produced by the fermentation process of yeast turning sugar into alcohol. I would guess this is primarily how it's done, but there could be other (post-fermentation) processes of removing alcohol. (EDIT: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_beer#Brewing_process" rel="nofollow"&gt;according to Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, I'm totally wrong. Most low- or non-alcoholic beer is made by boiling off the alcohol.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In terms of taste, lighter beers (in terms of alcohol content), generally taste, well, lighter. I like many higher-alcohol beers because the alcohol seems to bring out many of the more complex flavours in the beer, making it (in my opinion) more interesting. That's not to say that all strong beers are good or all light beers are bad, as there are many other things to consider. But I don't think it's possible to get the same complexity and flavour into a light 3.2% beer as it is in a stronger beer, in my experience anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Any beer is only as good as the brewer's skills. In London (UK) we have a brewery producing a 2.8% abv beer (Redemption brewery, beer name escapes me) which is packed with hops and of greater hop depth than many IPAs. Batches of a beer that are brewed to be low alcohol will necessarily be different to those brewed at full strength which is why I would hope (pray?) that any brewer whose product is worth drinking would make a different beer, brewed at low strength for these markets. These beers can be as flavoursome and exciting as, if not more so than, higher strength beers.
					The process to make the beer lower ABV is simply reducing the amount of sugar that can be converted into alcohol by using a lower sugar content mash either using specific lower sugar malts, using less malt, or using a yeast that will not support higher alcohol concentrations (alcohol kills yeast...!). Using less yeast won't work as the given yeast will continue to multiply to make up the shortfall. If you are not making real beer halting the fermentation early by killing the yeast with heat (or similar) will produce a lower alcohol beer but it will be sweeter as there is more unfermented sugar. Fining and serving real ale before fermentation has produced a higher strength may have a similar effect for those types of beer.
					Since alcohol dissolves flavouring compounds better than water it is much harder to brew a highly flavoured weak beer &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; this may be offset by taste complexity.
					Larger breweries will reduce alcohol levels chemically post-production by boiling off alcohol or similar. this will reduce the flavouring compounds in the beer (see GCSE fractional distillation notes or similar for details) and so make the beer taste weaker. These are produced at mass market quantities and even the full strength product is pretty awful compared with crafted or real beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Retail stores in Colorado sell spirits, wine, and beer. Grocery and convenience stores sell 3.2 percent beer only, and then not between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. Package stores are open 8 a.m. until midnight and are closed on Sundays. Bars stop selling alcohol between 2 a.m. and 7 a.m.&lt;br&gt;
					&lt;a href="http://www.alcohollaws.org/coloradoalcohollaws.html"&gt;http://www.alcohollaws.org/coloradoalcohollaws.html&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would guess those "grocery stores" selling spirits and such are probably classified as something other than a grocery store.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This information may be a little out of date, Colorado does allow Sunday sales now. I found this on Wikipedia:  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Spirituous, vinous &amp;amp; malt liquor available in liquor stores and
					  liquor-licensed drug stores only.  Liquor stores closed on Christmas
					  Day. Sunday sales restriction lifted on July 1, 2008. Liquor stores
					  and liquor-licensed drug stores may have only one location, while 3.2%
					  beer may be sold in gas stations, supermarkets, and convenience
					  stores. Appropriately licensed businesses may also sell 3.2% beer for
					  both on and off-premise consumption. A small number of grocery stores
					  are licensed as drug stores and sell full strength beer, wine, and
					  spirits. As an example, a chain grocery store that has pharmacy
					  services at most or all locations may elect a single location in the
					  chain as the licensed establishment to sell beer, wine, and spirits.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The above answer is correct.  Just to expand a little, companies can only hold one Colorado retail liquor store license, which is the type of license that allows them to sell "full strength" beer, wine and spirits.  It's the same class of liquor license held by the liquor stores found in most shopping centers.  There is no limit to the number of 3.2% beer licenses a company can hold.  For example, a Safeway store in Glendale holds their only retail liquor store license, while Target holds theirs at a store in Littleton.  Their other Colorado stores all hold licenses to sell 3.2% beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In Colorado only 1 store in a chain is allowed to sell liquor, wine or full strength beer. These are known as 'State Stores'... So a chain like Target or King Soopers picks one location in the state that they want to have that license and that's the one that can sell it... All others are only allowed to sell 3.2 beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;it doesnt matter what beer you drink , whether it is a beer bought from the grocery store or a liquor store in colorado. it is all the same beer, bottled off the same vat. every beer is sold is measured alchohol by volume, except 3.2% beer which is measured as alcohol by weight. ask a brewer they will tell you the same. they ( the beer owners) did this so that they could get around the blue laws prohibiting beer sales on sunday, but without any cost increase to the business. if you drink coors light bought at a liquor store its 4.2% ABV, that very same beer bought at a 7-11 is 3.2% ABW. the measurement ABW is just about a 1% difference vs. ABV.&lt;/p&gt;
