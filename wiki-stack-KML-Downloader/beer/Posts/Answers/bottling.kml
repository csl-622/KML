					&lt;p&gt;As you might expect, cans can impart a metallic flavor on some beer, but on the flip-side, they are much less prone to skunking. So if you're looking to store the beer for a while in a cool, dark place, I'd say bottle. However, if you plan on keeping it in a light place or outdoors, a can is probably your best bet.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Guinness is "carbonated" with nitrogen, where most beers use carbon dioxide. This requires different hardware, bottling equipment, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you've ever witnessed the appearance of a perfectly poured Guinness, and paid more than $5 USD for it, you'll understand why. It's partly about presentation. As one of the oldest beers on the market, it requires us to jump through some hoops to ensure we are enjoying it correctly. In short: I think it's mostly marketing!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Plastic food packaging in general is usually lined with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_A" rel="nofollow"&gt;Bisphenol A (aka. BPA)&lt;/a&gt;, as are some canned goods, which is a rather controversial chemical. It's been linked to cancer, sexual dysfunction, and other ailments. So I try to avoid it whenever possible and buy my food in glass jars. I can only imagine how much BPA is  dissolved into alcoholic beverages which are bottled in plastic or cans, being that alcohol is corrosive. I learned that lesson when I tried cleaning my GameBoy with rubbing alcohol as a kid. So I try to avoid alcohol bottled in plastic and canned alcohol as well.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The thing you have to realize is that plastic isn't really a solid, but a very viscous liquid. Glass is also a liquid, but it's much more viscous than plastic. That's why if you've ever been in a building that's a couple hundred years old, the glass on the windows is thicker at the bottom of the glass panes. Since both are liquids, they're obviously going to get into your drink. However, glass is a natural substance while plastic is not, so I trust it more.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A modern canned beer should never taste like metal. If it does, you're probably drinking straight from the can, and while the folks at &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/amgfgU5-lhs" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Alchemist might recommend that&lt;/a&gt;, I can't say I share their view.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Modern beer cans are lined with a water-based chemical that essentially ensures that your beer &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; touches metal. This in turn means that strictly speaking, canned beers will keep longer without being &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/50/will-temperature-changes-cause-a-beer-to-skunk?rq=1"&gt;skunked&lt;/a&gt;, and pressurized packing means there's less air in a can then a bottle, which adds further preservative benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, very few beers that are good enough for this decision to matter are offered in a &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt; of containers - most small breweries just don't have the capacity to both can and bottle - especially of the sort of small-batch stuff that you'd actually be interested in trying to cellar and age. Furthermore, there are significant environmental and economic arguments in favor of both bottles and cans.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, choose the packaging that's more convenient for you to store, consume from, and recycle when you're done. The quality difference is essentially insignificant. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I do not think that the type of cork is important. The important thing is that the cork used seals of the bottle so that no wild yeasts or bacteria are able to enter the bottle. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Traditionally cork and flip-top caps have been used for beers required for preservation, however any seal would do. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In my opinion it's more about tradition than functionality. Just as with french wines plastic corks can actually provide a more durable seal than metallic caps or real corks as they are less susceptible to decay due to moist. However in the spirit of the tradition and to keep customers happy it's often a less preferred option.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For instance, Belgium is a fairly traditional country and you will often never find plastic beer bottles or twist-top caps. Not because they are up to the task, but just because the Belgians didn't like it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There was a &lt;a href="http://www.trollekelder.be/getapte-bieren-versus-bieren-uit-fles/"&gt;study about this&lt;/a&gt; which concluded that tapped beer can actually be better for different reasons (although taste is rather subjective). The reasons are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Beer on draught tends to have less air within the barrel compared to its bottled counterpart, meaning that the beer doesn't oxidise as quickly&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Beer within a barrel tends to remain cool for longer periods. A bottled beer cools and warms up a lot faster, which (when this occurs) has a nefast effect on the beer's taste&lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Guinness, and a few other beers out there, are carbonated in part with nitrogen, which has much smaller bubbles.  This creates a smoother mouthfeel; this is the "creaminess" that is often described.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The use of nitrogen is probably uncommon for a few reasons.  Firstly, there's the added production cost in the bottled or canned product: the widget.  Secondly, I would wager that most breweries want the product to taste similar on draught as in a can or bottle, and it's very uncommon to have nitrogen available in a taproom.  (You can get special taps which "cream" the beer on the way out, but again, for consistency those would have to be installed where-ever you sell your beer.)  So it's something of an uphill battle.  Finally, not all beers may benefit from a different type of carbonation than what's prevalent... but of course, that's subjective.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The bottle cap has the same purpose as a wire cage-- to ensure that the cork doesn't pop itself under the bottle's interior pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Provided all the bottling equipment was properly sanitised (which you'd hope was the case for commercial beer), you shouldn't notice any impact on the taste of the beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, plastic bottles do not provide as good a seal as a crown sealed glass bottle.  If you store the beer for long enough (say six months to a year), a plastic bottle will have lost some of its carbonation.  If you stick to the "drink by" date on commercial beer though, this shouldn't be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While, as object88 says, it is uncommon for draught beers to use nitrogen, it is becoming more prevalent, though certainly not dwarfing CO2 draught beers anytime soon! So, it is certainly possible to remain consistent from bottle to draught, though it is less common and more costly to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Both bottled and draught beers use nitrogen to add bubbles instead of CO2 on occasion. This is more common with malty beers, say stouts and porters, than it is for hoppy beers. The nitrogen makes smaller bubbles than CO2, and creates a thick head due to the lower solubility of nitrogen in water than CO2 at the same temperatures. This creates the thicker mouthfeel that Guinness (as well as other nitrogenated stouts) are known for. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;CO2 will likely continue to be used for most hop-forward beers, since it pushes more aroma out of the beer (including the delicious hop scent!) while nitro is more about the mouthfeel and well-rounded flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A few reasons why other beers don't use the small nitrogen ball devices ("nitrogen widgets"):&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Alcohol laws (or FDA or something?) doesn’t allow craft brewers to add
					  widgets/foreign objects to alcohol (cans). Imports exempt?&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Not cost effective for small brewers, who are only just able to start
					  affording canning systems.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The can/bottle is required to have country of origin listed on it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most US Guinness Extra Stout is brewed in either Toronto or New Brunswick, depending on the contract brewer. All of the Guinness Draught is brewed in their historic brewery in Dublin. However, debate abounds about whether the US recipe is different.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The likely answer is somewhere between carbonation pressure and marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's hard to find numbers for how much caps can handle vs corks but you should notice that most corked beers also come in bottles with very thick glass, this is because the beer inside is at a higher pressure than most other styles.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most beer styles will fall pretty close to 2.0 or 2.5 volumes of CO2 (just the term, think of the number as a relative baseline), but a lot of Belgian strong beers like Bierre de Garde or Tripel will be carbonated with 3.3+ volumes.  Lambics and other sour beers can go up to 4.5 volumes.  This is a linear scale so that becomes possibly twice as much pressure as a normal bottle...so yeah, thicker glass.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;At such high pressure you might find corks will stay put more reliably than a cap since it has more surface area in contact with the bottle.  It also might provide a more airtight seal than a cap for long-term aging.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Those would be technical considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Corking also predated capping so there's also a very traditional feel about a bottle with a cork and a cage, which can fit into the traditional image a lot of breweries market themselves using.  I say I'm not sure and it could just be marketing because a lot of Wheat styles like German Wheats, Belgian Wits, etc are fairly highly carbonated (near the 3.3 volumes range) but most of them have no problems being capped.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As to the affect on taste?  Nada, apart from hypothetical aging concerns...unless mistreated you should not taste the cork.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A cap is not going to fly off a bottle unless it is not properly seated, no matter the carbonation. It is crimped onto the bottle. The bottle will first explode. It is also incorrect that a cork is necessary for higher carbonated beers. Many of the styles identified at higher carbonation volumes also come in capped bottles (particularly 375ml bottles). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Corks do provide a better seal that slows the flow of air into the beer so those bottles will age more slowly than bottles with caps. That is the primary technical difference between the two.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The primary reasons for corking beer today is marketing. In some areas where corked bottles were traditionally used for bottling it was easier to get champagne bottles or similar bottles that could support carbonation and corking became a matter of convenience as it was cheaper to source bottles locally. However, now it is just a matter of marketing the product. All other corked bottles went into large format, corked bottles to make them look like a classier product than a six pack and legitimize higher prices in the customers' eyes. That is true for the beers you find on the market today in almost all cases. Very few beers go into corked bottles because the brewer truly believes it is necessary for the long term quality of the beer in a way that a cap or a cap plus wax would not provide.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question one&lt;/strong&gt;: how does bottled beer differ from draught beer?
					This varies from beer to beer, and should be handled on a beer-to-beer basis. Sometimes beer in the bottle is pasteurized, while the keg is not. Sometimes one or the other is filtered, while the other is not. The gas content can also differ, since this is adjustable in draught systems but not with bottles.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In some cases, such as when yeast content is very important for the flavor profile of a beer, like German Hefeweizen, how much yeast you get in your glass has a big impact on the drinking experience. When drinking from the bottle, you can make sure that you get all of the yeast from the bottom of the bottle into your glass by agitating the last few ounces of beer, but this isn't possible with a keg. 
					Kegged versions of these beers still have yeast in them, but you're not getting that perfect ratio in every glass. In my two years as a beer enthusiast living in Germany, these beers are almost always served from the bottle, and every bar or bartender has their preferred method for getting all the yeast out of a bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question two&lt;/strong&gt;: What is done to bottled beer to prolong its shelf life?
					This also differs from beer to beer. Some imports are pasteurized in the bottle, some others, namely MillerCoors products, use proprietary hop derivatives like Tetrahop to keep hop flavor while minimizing hop oils' susceptibility to producing off-flavors due to light exposure. This isn't a bad or unnatural thing, and I hope this becomes more widespread, because skunked, lightstruck beer is awful. (see &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/2010/12/03/131785456/Searching-For-Science-In-A-Glass-of-Beer" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt;) This, however, is also present in kegged beer, as it has other beneficial properties like increased head retention.
					Sometimes, though, nothing is done beyond packaging, like Sierra Nevada's transition from twist-off to pry-off caps a few years ago to combat leaking, infection, and oxidation. &lt;a href="http://brookstonbeerbulletin.com/sierra-nevadas-new-pry-off-cap/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Brookston Beer Blog 2007&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question three&lt;/strong&gt;: Why is draught so much better?
					Very, very subjective, and you may want to clarify or qualify this in the future. Is good draught beer better than old, skunked bottled beer? Yes. Is good bottled beer better than flat draught beer poured through dirty lines? Also yes. Each has its pros and cons when it comes to service and storage.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would venture to say that much of draught beer's appeal comes from it being special- you typically have to go somewhere else to get it in a way that's not usually available to the home user, like how the theater experience differs from the home movie experience. Yes, you can get bottled beer in bars, too, but it's still a more "normal" format. In terms of taste over experience, though, I don't know that you could say for sure without some sort of blind tasting with lots of variables (age, glass type, line cleanliness, CO2 pressure) controlled for. Even then, what does it for the tasters might not do it for you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the aerator top is still working, meaning that no air has gotten to the wine, you should still be able to bottle it. The best way to know is to taste it. If it tastes right, you should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think they would not make a good candidate for beer or wine bottles if you want to subject them to moisture or cold&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stickergiant.com/static-cling-decals" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Static Cling Labels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Static Clings are usually made of a flexible vinyl or plastic that has a very smooth coat and will stick to clean glass surfaces utilizing the moisture in the air and on the glass to adhere to the surface. In cold weather and dry climates static clings tend to dry up, freeze and then fall off easily. The vinyl material will not retain its "cling" abilities for more than a year or two depending on the conditions where the cling is exposed. Some static cling options can be refreshed with soap and water, which is great for long-term use. Static Clings may need a custom quote.&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's been a long time since I originally asked this question. While my contributing answer here doesn't &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; clear up why draught beer (maybe, maybe doesn't) taste better than bottled beer, two things are clear to me now after spending a lot of time reflecting on the difference:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As Tom pointed out in the very first comment, drinking beer (and coffee too, for that matter!) out of a small spout (bottle, travel mug, etc.) blocks your nose from inhaling the aromas of the beer. This limits the amount of flavour you can sense. Pouring the bottled beer into a glass dramatically improves its flavour because the open mouth of the glass allows you to taste &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; smell.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There's an inverse relationship between perceived "better" taste and the volume of bottles a brewery produces (and how far they intend to distribute). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer brewed at a local microbrew has a shelf-life of only a few weeks on the outside; preservatives are limited or omitted and their ingredients are typically fresh, with a comparably short self-life. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Larger breweries distribute further distances, demand a longer shelf-life, and usually have a need to maintain a consistent taste across their entire production line and the resulting shelf-life. These breweries use high-volume equipment (an increase in the amount the beer is processed) and high-volume ingredients (preservatives in ingredients make them last longer, but may not be fresh). It also becomes increasingly difficult to quality-control when mass-producing —  these breweries are less likely to take risks, and they rely on machinery to achieve consistency, often sacrificing quality. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;tl;dr:&lt;/em&gt; draught beer, like micro-brewed beer was never intended to last for months or years on the shelf, and thus preservatives don't need to be factored into the production, and the beer is liable to be fresher more flavourful.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One last bonus point&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've also noticed that at times, bottled microbrews, poured into a glass can actually taste &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than their draught counterparts. Go figure ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Let's start with what are Nomex corks and what are natural corks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomex" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Nomex&lt;/a&gt; is a registered trademark for flame-resistant meta-aramid material developed in the early 1960s by DuPont and first marketed in 1967.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Nomex and related aramid polymers are related to nylon, but have aromatic backbones, and hence are more rigid and more durable. Nomex is the premier example of a meta variant of the aramids (Kevlar is a para aramid). Unlike Kevlar, Nomex cannot align during filament formation and has poorer strength. However, it has excellent thermal, chemical, and radiation resistance for a polymer material.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;"Nomex corks" for wine do not exist. In fact "Nomex cork" material is used as a &lt;a href="http://www.auburn-mfg.com/gasket-material-guide.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;gasket material&lt;/a&gt; for engines and the like. &lt;strong&gt;I believe you are thinking of rubber corks.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Natural cork comes from the outer bark of the cork tree.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Cork is produced from the sponge like material taken from cork oak trees, also known as Quercus Suber. Cork oak trees are grown primarily in Portugal. Cork started to become the sealing material of choice in the late 1600’s when it became possible to create glass wine bottles with an almost uniform shape and design. It took until the late 1700’s to create easy to use corkscrews for the wine lover or tavern owner. At that point in history, cork replaced glass wine stoppers, which while they worked well, glass stoppers were not easy to remove without breaking the wine bottle. The pairing of the cork and wine bottle ushered fine wine into the modern age, as from that point forward, wine had the ability to age and evolve in the bottle. Interestingly cork and fine wine share another commonality. The cork, oak tree needs to be at least 25 years old before the material used to create the cork can be harvested. This is similar to the age of vines in many of the world’s best wine regions. While grape vines are harvested every year, cork trees are only able to be harvested once every nine years. - &lt;a href="http://www.thewinecellarinsider.com/wine-topics/wine-education-articles/wine-corks-everything-need-know-wine-corks/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wine Corks Everything You Need to Know About Wine Corks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternative wine closures or corks&lt;/strong&gt; can be seen here and many are known as rubber corks and plastic corks: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Alternative wine closures are substitute closures used in the wine industry for sealing wine bottles in place of traditional cork closures. The emergence of these alternatives has grown in response to quality control efforts by winemakers to protect against "cork taint" caused by the presence of the chemical trichloroanisole (TCA). - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_wine_closure" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Alternative wine closures (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are pros and cons to using of all types of corks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The problems with synthetic corks is the lack of a perfect seal. In turn that allows more unwanted air into the bottle, causing the wine to oxidize. Worse, many of the synthetic corks have been known to impart a slight rubber or chemical smell, damaging the wine. Beherns and Hitchcock, a producer of Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa California was one of the early proponents of plastic corks. Most of the wines bottled using those synthetic corks have not developed well. Many of those wines are defective. However, today, they have improved since their initial creation. Because the plastic corks allow air to integrate at a faster pace than normal corks, some winemakers actually prefer it. In fact, that has become part of the selling point as the corks can be ordered to allow for a more or less rapid transmission of air into the wine, based on the tightness of seal.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Wine corks do however have problems, the major issue being infection with TCA, which causes what is known by wine collectors and others in the wine business as Corked Wine. Corked bottles of wine remains a serious problem in the wine industry as many people think that it effects between 5% to 10% of all wine undrinkable.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The old saying that nothing lasts forever is especially true with wine. When a wine cork degrades, so does the wine, due to additional exposure to air, which in turn causes premature oxidization. Before that happens, for rare and expensive bottles, it might be possible to replace your old cork with a new wine cork. This is something you cannot do at home on your own. For more on replacing your wine cork, &lt;a href="http://www.thewinecellarinsider.com/wine-topics/wine-educational-questions/recorked-or-reconditioned-bottles-explained" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Everything you need to know about Re-Corking wine bottles.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Corks have been the undisputed choice to seal wine bottles for hundreds of years. But with all the alternative enclosures available these days, &lt;em&gt;by 2016, it is estimated that only 70% of all wine bottles today are sealed with natural corks.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Still, at the end of day, it is unlikely corks will be replaced as the sealer of choice for the best wines.&lt;/strong&gt; In part, there is the romance and tradition of removing the cork, coupled with that special popping sound that lets you know, you are about to drink a wine and that is something technology cannot improve on. - &lt;a href="http://www.thewinecellarinsider.com/wine-topics/wine-education-articles/wine-corks-everything-need-know-wine-corks/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wine Corks Everything You Need to Know About Wine Corks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Although natural cork is more eco-friendly, they are s slightly more expensive than their counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
