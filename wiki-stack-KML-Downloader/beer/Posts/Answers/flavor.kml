					&lt;p&gt;I think you'd have trouble with this because of different dimensions of flavor.  Beer has a very complex flavor and different recipes are different.  One can order beers (if specific enough to include a brand) along any dimension of flavor, but I am not sure that you can order them consistently along all dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here are dimensions I would think of:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Malty/caramel&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Hop-forward&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Bitter (Hops)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Yeasty&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It isn't clear to me how one rates strength of flavor between an IPA and a porter for example.  So I think the answer here is a simple "no, you can't."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ok, so the basic brewing process is this (not homebrewing detail here, just a distant overview):&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Heat your wort with water, steep, then add hops and boil, add more hops as you begin to cool, once cool enough add yeast, ferment, bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Flavored beers can be made a bunch of different ways. You can add herbs, spices, or flavorings before or after the boil, for example.  Seeds and roots would usually be added before the boil; herbs would usually be added after.  I would probably add fruit after but this is something that folks could argue about forever.  If you buy something like smoke-flavored beer, chili flavored beer, etc. these are probably made this way.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There's a second type of flavored beer I have seen for sale in certain bars and restaurants in Asia though.  That's where you take a fairly light beer on tap and add it to a glass along with a shot of flavoring syrup (like lychee or peach).  These usually have sweeter flavor with clearer fruit flavors than the fermented fruit beers.  If the beer is pasteurized, the flavoring could be added before bottling and carbonation.  I think that is what you are seeing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Just a fun fact: Some consider if you add something other than hops, malt, water and yeast to beer, it is no longer technically a beer according to German purity law. What you have is a malt beverage. (You can see this in the small print on malt beverages such as SweetWater Blue for example)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EO4n4.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EO4n4.jpg" alt="Sweet Water Brewing Company"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_Oki6Tg0i_EI/TYyqe8EuEwI/AAAAAAAAIJ0/QsTaOXPlfXc/post1_thumb%5B6%5D.jpg%3Fimgmax%3D800" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Sweet Water Brewing Company Label&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Edit: (This is controversial and certainly not enforced)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are tons of flavors you can impart based on the types of hops and malts you use and when you add them in the brewing process.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When boiling the wort, you can add hops to impart flavor midway through the process. If you add them at the beginning, you get bitterness primarily from the hops. If you add them at the end, you get primarily aroma from the hops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is common practice to add hops in all 3 stages for those reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There's also a lot of flavor that you can add to the beer by aging it in barrels. It is common to use barrels from whiskey or bourbon for this purpose among craft brewers. This can add a huge punch of flavor in some beers. (This may be happening on in the Rogue beer you linked to)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The Rogue Voodoo Doughnut Maple Bacon Ale is an interesting example because the ingredients list shows two different ways flavors can be imparted to beer.  The smoky bacon flavor comes both from the actual inclusion of bacon and from the smoked malt: &lt;em&gt;Briess Cherrywood Smoked Malt, Weyermann Beechwood Smoked Malt, House-smoked Hickory Malt&lt;/em&gt;.  As discussed in &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/53/does-chocolate-stout-contain-real-chocolate/65#65"&gt;Does chocolate stout contain real chocolate?&lt;/a&gt;, certain flavors can be achieved through the malting process rather than through additional ingredients.  Similarly maple is fermentable and could be added directly to boost alcohol content and impart a more subtle maple flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, this beer does contain actual bacon and "maple flavor".  To get a look at and when and how the flavors are added, we can look at &lt;a href="http://www.brewtoad.com/recipes/inspired-by-rogue-voodoo-doughnut-maple-bacon-ale" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this clone recipe&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Name              Amount     Time        Use
					Fenugreek         0.25 oz    5.0 min     Boil
					Maple Extract     1.0 oz     6.0 days    Primary
					Bacon, cooked     4.0 oz     0.0 days    Bottle
					&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here, fenugreek is added during the boil phase, while creating the wort.  The boiling helps extract the flavor from the herb.  Maple extract gets added later during fermentation.  Maple extract or syrup could be used, but syrup is more expensive and fermentable so a stronger maple flavor is being achieved with extract.  The official ingredient list calls for "Pure Maple Flavoring" so I assume the same is being done there.  Lastly the bacon is being added at the end.  This is to add direct flavoring to the beer without interfering in the fermentation process.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some types of hops have interesting flavors. For example, simcoe hops has a pine-y, fruity taste. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some interesting beer ideas would be pine, rosemary, or cardamom (I've had one - it was amazing). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, some white beers (like Hoegaarden) have coriander and citrus peel. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is whole style of beer, which is made with honey. It is made by adding honey to the wort during or before fermentation. Thanks to addition of honey in early stages you get balanced, homogeneous taste. Nothing to add that honey will ferment along with malt.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Technically you can add anything to beer when it is ready (including honey), but then you get this aggressive flavor on top.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ginger beer is not just water, sugar, crushed ginger and  yeast. I make it with some spices boilled in water to flavour it, some of it to kill off the yeast if I want it to. KIlling off the yeast makes it an ale ; and cider must have apples or apple juice in it.  That's my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The price and quality (or lack thereof) of the beer doesn't particularly come into play in whether it is sweet or not but rather how much residual sugar is left.  All beer has sugar in some form, as fermentable sugars are is what the yeast eat to turn into alcohol.  No sugar, no alcohol.  No alcohol, no beer.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The sugar in beer primarily comes from malted barley, though other grains are often used including rye, wheat, oats, and open in the case of cheap beer, rice and corn.  In my experience, it's fairly rare to find a lager (particularly a cheap one, where they want to minimize the cost of the ingredients for a given batch) with enough residual sugar to taste sweet, but it could happen I suppose.   Sweet beers are frequently heavier, like barleywine style ales, milk stouts, and chocolate stouts. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can also add non-traditional ingredients to boost the amount of residual sugar in beer, and sugar itself, in a number of forms (table sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup, maple syrup, etc.) is certainly one of those ingredients that is used from time to time.  Fruit is another common ingredient used to manipulate the flavor and sweetness in beer, and you'll find virtually all kinds used in various brews.  Some or the more fruits that can particularly add to the final sugar content are cherries, berries, grapes, peaches, apricots, and grapefruit.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As the old saying goes, "There's no accounting for taste."   So, objectively, no, there is no such thing as too hoppy as long as some enjoy them.   There certainly are beers that are so bitter that they have very limited appeal and that can completely drown out other flavors rending not only the beer itself a one-note show, but eliminates the taste from anything else you eat or drink in close proximity.   Stone's Ruination is an example of this.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, while many aren't drawn to the "hop-bombs" that seem to get bigger and bigger all the time, the fact that there's a market to support them would indicate that they are not, in fact, "too hoppy." &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The alcohol in beer is created as a byproduct of the yeast consuming the sugar in wort during the fermentation process.  For a beer to taste sweet, there are two possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The yeast died before the fermentation process ran to completion.  There are various chemicals that can do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wort contained some non-fermentable sugars.  If the yeast can't feed on a particular type of sugar, then it is going to remain in the end product.  Lactose is a traditional example of such a sugar but some artificial sweeteners have a similar effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Assuming that the flavour was intended, I would guess that this was (2): using non-fermentable sugars allows the brewer to know exactly how much will end up in the final beer.  It is also the only option if they do in-bottle carbonation, since that requires live yeast in the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.brewersfriend.com/2009/01/24/beer-styles-ibu-chart-graph-bitterness-range/"&gt;International bittering units (IBU)&lt;/a&gt; measure the bitterness of different beer styles. IPAs have a wide range, and they're typically higher on the scale. If you can find the IBU of a beer you want to try (on Untappd, on the bottle, or some bars make this information available), you can compare it to other beers that you like to determine if it might be too bitter for your tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've tasted some beers that are way off the IBU scale that I linked to, but it's still subjective to say that these beers are "too hoppy." It's a matter of taste that I'd compare to saying that some foods are "too spicy." Some people might just like to try these novelty beers once, and other people might really develop a taste for them.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I feel like this is a pretty opinion based question, especially with IPAs being so "in" right now.  Ignoring the taste of hoppiness, which is different from bitterness (dear Bob that myth needs to die), there's a limit to how much bitterness we humans can actually perceive.  Past about 100 IBUs the tongue straight up can't tell that there are any more.  Now we perceive the quality of bitterness differently.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So bitterness in beer is provided primarily by adding hops and boiling them for a long time.  The length of time and pH of the wort affects a chemical reaction called "Isomerization", which is the process by which Alpha Acids in hop oils become Iso-Alpha Acids which stay stably in solution and make beer taste bitter.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Similarly, there are also Beta Acids.  Generally these are in 1:1 ratio with the Alpha acids but sometimes there are more or less depending on the hop types.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beta Acids are chemically Lupulones and Alpha Acids are Humulones.  We've identified 3 types of each as well: No prefix, Co-, and Ad-.  Most homebrewing hop packets list total alpha acid %, then % of those acids that are Cohumulone.  But straight IBUs don't take which acids were used to get to that number.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Humulone is thought to give the best, smoothest, most pleasing bitterness.  Cohumulone can be pretty abrasive, and the bitterness may seem rougher or more astringent...or just more bitter, even at the same IBUs.  Beta acids are also thought of as a "rough" bitterness, but they primarily produce bitterness via oxidation and can help long term shelf-stability.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I don't know what all this really helps to answer, but I guess the main points are that you can't taste past 100 IBUs, but there are qualities to bitterness that can make some beers more abusive than others.  Also my final point is that hop flavor and aroma don't make a beer bitter.  If the hops have been boiled enough to actually make a beer that bitter...you do not taste those hops.  You can have hoppy beers that are smooth and not bitter at all by hop selection, yeast selection, dry hopping, and not boiling them hops very much.  You can also make beer more bitter by yeast selection and certain grains.  You can also make Ruination or Palate Wrecker, but the point is that hoppiness and bitterness are not the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Peated malt can provide a beer with subtle smokiness. Peated malt is malt that has been smoked over peat (decaying vegetation). This is common in Scotch &amp;amp; Whisky Ales.

					&lt;p&gt;To add a bit of detail to the existing answers, the primary method for adding a smoked flavor to beer is by using malts that have been dried over a smoky fire, rather than in a kiln which allows the malt to absorb compounds from the smoke that they then release into the beer during brewing.  Some of the oldest smoked beers still produced are German (Rauchbiers) and the malt is dried over &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rauchbier#Bamberg_Rauchbier"&gt;beechwood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Other woods can be used, and you can find malt smoked over oak, cherrywood, and any number of other species.  As mentioned in another answer, peat can be used as well and in fact is for &lt;a href="http://www.stonebrewing.com/porter/"&gt;Stone's Smoked Porter&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another method for adding a smoky flavor is to use &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_smoke"&gt;liquid smoke extract&lt;/a&gt;. This is made my cooling and condensing smoke with water, and can be used instead of smoked malt.  I'm not aware of commercial brewers who use this method, but it's a way for home brewers who use malt extract instead of dried malt to add smokiness to their beers. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In terms of bitterness vs hoppiness, with the 3 stages in the process where hops are generally added, only the final stage gives distinct hoppiness (as opposed to bitterness) as the hops aren't in the mix long enough for heat to break down the oils and flavour.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The reason why there are so many types of hops used, in varying concentrations, at various stages throughout beer making is because &lt;strong&gt;people are different&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;I love a hoppy beer. Hoppier the better (at least in the summer months)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;My wife hates them.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So really, the answer to your question is &lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt; - some beers aren't too hoppy; they are just too hoppy for you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, there is no such thing as too hoppy. Beers like Heady Topper have an incredible amount of hops, yet are highly drinkable.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, some beers have a poor malt/hops balance, and as as result have an overbearing hope profile. These beers smell and taste like grass, and are not very drinkable.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One other potential source of smoke flavors is actually the yeast.  Some yeast produce phenolic compounds during fermentation that produce smoke flavors and aromas.  Scottish yeast strains in particular are known for this.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I will update this answer when I get more information from OP about region but I believe the following will be helpful: [edit]: reread the tags and spotted that it was US - think that my thoughts all still stand up but will check some specifics on US beer festivals.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the UK and a few other countries and regions organizations like CAMRA (the Campaign for Real Ale) run beer festivals which work out, on a pint for pint basis, cheaper when trying a wide variety of beers. Although there is usually an entry fee (at least as far as CAMRA events go) each drink tends to be cheaper and there is the option of trying more different beers by buying in half pint measures (recommended). The biggest benefit of going to festivals, however, is the &lt;em&gt;range&lt;/em&gt; of beers available. A liquor store / off license / bar can only really stock a few different beers and these are usually ones that they can get consistently, in volume, and at either a suitable price or within their tie (don't get me started on the beer tie), whereas festivals are much freer to buy different beers from varying sources as they are one-off events and less restricted.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A second idea would be to set up a tasting club so that you can share the costs and the beers. This runs the risk (!) of making new friends as well!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;source: I help to run a CAMRA beer festival and work at 2+ others dependent on my free time&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can look for breweries in your areas that give tours. These often include free tastings. (Since you mentioned you're from the Chicago area, I know there's a bus tour that takes you to different breweries in Chicago and Milwaukee. There's a fee, but you'd get to try a lot of different beers.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, look for brewpubs and restaurants in your area that sell &lt;em&gt;flights&lt;/em&gt; of beer. A flight is 4-5 samples of different beers served together. The cost is normally about the same as a full glass, and the total volume is usually the same or a little more. This allows you to try 4 or 5 different beers for about the same price as you'd normally pay for one.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One source of smokiness unmentioned as of yet is vinvyl-guaiacol production from bacteria metabolism.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The answers already given are more relevant, however there is one important source that has been unmentioned. Although more common in distilling, lactobacillus and other strains of bacteria can attribute flavor to fermentation products. Different strains induce a different, possibly harmful, effect. Focusing on lactobacillus, which is your common bacteria used in cheese making, lactobacillus can introduce more lactic acid into the beer. This anaerobic bacteria is more active either before fermentation has started (either by contamination or inoculation) and after fermentation has ended. More so after fermentation this bacteria has metabolize the autolysis products of yeast. The acids from this bacteria later form into vinvyl-guaiacol, a flavor compound that lends a spicy and smokey note.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Most beer shops and some grocery stores (if that's legal in your state) allow you to do a "Mixer-Sixer" or "Create your own six-pack" where you can combine a variety of single bottles/cans for a variety six pack.  You pay a little bit extra per bottle for the convenience but and you get to pick specifically which ones you try.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To learn your preferences, I would suggest the following styles: (ordered from darkest to lightest with a recommended beer in parenthesis)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Stout (Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Double Bock/Doppelbock (Ayinger Doppelbock)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;IPA (Dogfish Head 60min or 90min IPA)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Pale Ale (Sierra Nevada Pale Ale)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Pilsner (Bell's Beer by Bells Brewery - this is a traditional Czech Pilsner)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Hefeweizen (Paulaner Bavarian Hefeweizen)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;hr&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;@Bill The Lizard's answer:  Going on a brewery tour is definitely good advice.  Additionally, you should consider getting beer on tap which tends to be fresher and in better condition while at restaurants or breweries.  Furthermore, if you have the chance to visit a brewery, you should specifically try their seasonal, limited, and special releases.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The answer is subjective. A lot of people are referring to IBUs in their answers. IBUs are a weak approximation, they only give you an idea. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Try the beer yourself! I for one love bitterness and believe brewers should always push the limit of any flavor in pursuit of exciting, tasty beer. Yet as with anything it is a matter of balance. Some flavors compliment each other, some do not. Learn what you like, share. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you venture west to Iowa most HyVee stores will let you do the mixer-sixer as Gastrograph describes. Two of Iowa's best breweries are on the eastern side of the state as well in Toppling Goliath and Backpocket.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As more and more companies/breweries enter the craft beer market I think this is one of the most obvious ways they see to differentiate themselves, therefore I believe the beers you see that are solely for the purpose of being very hoppy and/or bitter are for marketing purposes. It would be akin to different hot sauce companies attempting to gain fame by making the hottest sauce, not necessarily the one that best complements food. In either case the consumer will have a memorable experience and will remember the name and possibly tell a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I live in a state that (mostly) requires that you buy beer by the case.  I feel your pain.  ("Mostly": there's still the bar option, and there are a very few places where you can buy mixed cases or six-packs of things other than the big mainstream beers.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The solution I'm partial to is the beer co-op.  Mine started as a group of coworkers; we've scattered to a bunch of different companies by now, but the co-op remains.  Every 4-6 weeks the organizer sends out email announcing a planned buy, with the goal of getting a multiple of 8 people (12 works, but we prefer 8).  Participants get a case with variety of beers and divide the total cost.  I've gotten to sample some beers I'd never have tried (or known about) otherwise.  (Most people don't participate every time, but the organizer does because, hey, beer.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you're doing a co-op anyway, then it's easy to add on the occasional "side buy" -- something that comes in 25oz bottles, or is particularly expensive, etc.  So long as there's enough interest to get the case, people can then buy them individually.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can be very organized about this, requiring commitments in advance, or you can be flexible and deal with the occasional surplus.  People interested enough to organize co-ops &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; don't mind some surplus (assuming finances aren't too tight).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The answer is no, there is not an objective measurement of "too hoppy". It is entirely preferential. You could however state that a beer is too hoppy to match a given style, for example a Berliner Weisse with a bitterness of 70 IBUs would be considered imbalanced for the style and would occupy it's own experimental category.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is really incomplete since you haven't given us your locale.  But Tremens is a Belgian Golden Strong ale, so you could find similar flavors in anything with a description like "Belgian Gold", "Belgian Strong", "Belgian Pale", "Tripel", "Blonde" (Except American Blonde).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For well-known brands you'd be looking for something like... Duvel, Piraat, Hades (Great Divide), St. Bernardus Tripel, Chimay, Westmalle, Leffe Blonde, La Trappe Blonde, a few of the beers by Unibroue...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This topic is very broad and subjective, but I would recommend anything by &lt;a href="http://www.allagash.com/beer/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Allagash&lt;/a&gt;, especially &lt;a href="http://www.allagash.com/beer/limited-edition/tiarna" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tiarna&lt;/a&gt; (outstanding), &lt;a href="http://thebruery.com/beers/mischief.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mischief&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://thebruery.com/beers/saisonrue.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Saison Rue&lt;/a&gt; by The Bruery, &lt;a href="http://lostabbey.com/beer/inferno-ale/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Inferno&lt;/a&gt; by Lost Abbey, as well as widely available Belgian classics like Chimay, Duvel, Rochefort, Leffe, Kwak.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The term "cider" is generally reserved for apples.  There are 'pear ciders' such as Woodchuck that use the name, but as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cider"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; points out, "A similar product made from pears is called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry"&gt;perry&lt;/a&gt; but sometimes (incorrectly) called Pear Cider in the marketing of some producers' products".  I personally can forgive this, since pears are closely related to apples, and the result is quite tasty.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The "beer" part of ginger beer is due to the fermentation process involved in its creation.  In this way, it is more similar to "root beer", since ginger is a root, like the sassafras root used in root beer and birch roots used in birch beer.  The website todayifoundout.com has a well referenced article for &lt;a href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/07/why-root-beer-is-called-that/"&gt;Why Root Beer is Called That&lt;/a&gt; covering the naming of root beer.  If the ginger based version isn't fermented, but is instead ginger flavouring added to carbonated water, it would be "ginger ale"; I have no idea why, since an India Pale Ale is certainly fermented.  Even with ginger products, the differentiation is not really all that terribly strict, as noted by this &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/20/ginger-ale-vs-ginger-beer_n_1438420.html"&gt;Huffington Post article&lt;/a&gt;.  Initially, ginger beer, root beer, birch beer, etc, were frequently alcoholic, but Prohibition ruined that for the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As a bit of a side note, the alcoholic versions are making a wonderful comeback (in my personal opinion) with &lt;a href="https://www.sprecherbrewery.com/hrb.php"&gt;Sprecher's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://smalltownbrewery.com/?page_id=11"&gt;Small Town Brewery&lt;/a&gt; for root beer.  I personally have not seen as much alcoholic ginger beer, but &lt;a href="http://www.crabbiesgingerbeer.co.uk/"&gt;Crabbies&lt;/a&gt; from the U.K. is quite good.  Although I personally do not like &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/697/24751/"&gt;Kuchi's ginger beer&lt;/a&gt;, I have several friends who absolutely love it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would suggest going with the beers that are brewed closest to you. Although transportation and supply chain storage has greatly improved, beer is always best when you are closest to the source. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina Brewers Guild will be a great resource for you to find beers in your area.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbeer.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.ncbeer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Belgian style beers, like the Delirium Tremens are growing in popularity very quickly. You should have no trouble finding some in your local area. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This might be a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You should try the famous smoke beer "Schlenkerla". Maybe you can find it in North Carolina: &lt;a href="http://www.schlenkerla.de/verkauf/haendlerint/retailer-us.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.schlenkerla.de/verkauf/haendlerint/retailer-us.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What about &lt;a href="http://desperadosbeer.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Desperados&lt;/a&gt;? The flavor goes in the direction of lemonade. Generally, you could try some beer mix drinks. Would that be an option?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When I try to pick beers for friends that don't tend to like "regular beer" in general, there are a few different styles I focus on.  It's worth mentioning up front that there are certain taste aversions that people have to different beers.  You mentioned getting her into a vanilla porter.  I have a favorite from Mill Street in Canada; they make a great vanilla porter.  The caveat though is that I like coffee a lot, and many people averse to beer tend to have trouble with the intense flavors of different varieties of beer, such as extreme hoppiness, heavily malted barley, or, darkly roasted barley that make up stouts and porters.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You mentioned less fruity beers, but talked about "Wild Blue" when you mentioned that.  Wild Blue is a Blueberry flavored lager; it's basically a "regular beer," but is infused with blueberry flavor to change it up.  I would look at other "fruity" styles that are still very authentic and internationally renowned, but pack less of a general beer flavor than a filtered rice/grain/barley beer would...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A good starter would be a more heavily wheat based beer.  Styles like Belgian wheats or German hefeweizens have less of that pronounced "regular beer" flavor, but are still in their own right, very prolific styles.  I tend to find Belgian wheats/"weisse/wittes(whites)" to be a bit more "chewy" with more of a banana/coriander flavor than their full blown German counterparts.  Good wheats that I would recommend would be Franziskaner or Hoegaarden.  They're safe forays into that style of beer that I almost always tend to get for new drinkers.  The cool thing is that if she likes them, you can really experiment with other varieties in that field.  Belgian doubles and triples tend to generally fall into a similar category, and they're arguably some of the finest beers in the world...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In my country, girls commonly love sweet beers. An example is Kriek. It is cherry beer (kriek is Dutch for cherry).
					I guess any sweet fruity beer could do the trick?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You have different beer types.
					For example, Kilkenny (Ginger Irish beer) is really tasty.
					Guinness, with an hard hops aroma.
					White beers from Germany are really tasty too, weight, but don't drink it too much...
					Belgium got blond et brunes, &amp;amp; are really famous.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Or, for a sweety beer, you can drink some banana, cherry, strawberry, cherry, passions beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Best beers comes from Eire, Germany &amp;amp; Belgium ;)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would also recommend she try a sour ale. They are a completely different kind of beer that doesn't taste like "normal beer". Since it's often the standard "beer" flavor that some don't like, going outside of the standard can't be a great way to find a favorable flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Flemish sours are excellent and would be a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;At least some pumpkin ales are brewed with real pumpkin (for example polish Dyniamit brewed by PINTA). 
					If you are interested in recepies you can look for them from the examples found at &lt;a href="https://www.brewtoad.com/search?search=pumpkin" rel="nofollow"&gt;Brewtoad.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some brewers design glasses to enhance the experience of the beer in various ways.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;IPAs in general benefit from a large opening to release as much aroma as possible, but there are other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I know Guinness in particular has designed a very special glass for their beer. The &lt;a href="http://www.drinkstuff.com/products/product.asp?ID=6480#.VBxccvldXPs" rel="nofollow"&gt;special glass&lt;/a&gt; features their golden harp, which you are supposed to aim for when pouring. This and the special curvatures of the glass help give the beer a good head and keep it until you're done with the beer. Stouts especially benefit from a silky, creamy head, so Guinness designed a glass around that.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've never had Kwak, but from the looks of the glass it seems to be more of a branding effort than anything else. I can't imagine any potential benefits from a glass that shape.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_glassware#Belgian_and_Dutch_styles" rel="nofollow"&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; article is a good read. It tells you what beer goes in what glass and why.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Actually, the glass does serve a purpose. &lt;a href="http://gloriousfoodandwinebelgianbeer.blogspot.com/2005/10/belgian-beer-no3-kwak-and-interesting.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;This site&lt;/a&gt; says the glass was invented for coachmen who weren't able to leave the horses and have some beer. The glass's peculiar shape allows it to be hung on the side of the coach for easy drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pump Up The Volume&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.hifibrewing.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Hi-Fi Brewing&lt;/a&gt; is the best pumpkin beer I've had, but you'll only get it poured in Redmond, if you're lucky enough to find it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;"Pump Up the Volume   A blast of pumpkin pie aroma introduces you to this full-bodied and fairly malty beer. We brew it with fresh Washington pumpkin and add cinnamon, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, cardamom, and vanilla after fermentation. It finishes with a very subtle warmth. Alcohol: 6.8% ABV, Bitterness: 35 IBU."&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Witch Hunt&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.bridgeportbrew.com/drink/big-brews#?cb=witch-hunt" rel="nofollow"&gt;Bridgeport Brewing&lt;/a&gt; was decent, but doesn't specify whether or not it's made with actual pumpkin flesh. I think we got a 22oz at Costco.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, a disclaimer:  I'm American and most of my knowledge of craft beer comes from the American beer scene.  I am somewhat aware of the evolution of the UK brewing industry, but nowhere near as knowledgeable as I am about America's.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Now, definitions.  Craft Beer commonly derives the Brewer's Association definition of a Craft Brewer.  Which is Small, Independent, Traditional.  Sparing the specifics it's a definition meant to exclude the world's largest brewing companies, and their "crafty" portfolios.  "Crafty" is a pejorative used to describe brands or brewers which may or may not produce good tasting beer, but are owned by the larger brands in attempts to diversify their portfolios.  While the BA is primarily focused on the American market, it seems most European writers defer to their terms.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Real Ale, is a distinctly British term.  Coined by CAMRA in the 70's it's more to do with the packaging and serving of the beer in the pub than the business scale of the brewer.  All Real Ale has to do is be cask conditioned and served via a gravity tap or hand-pulled with a beer engine.  This excludes a majority of what we in the US would consider craft beer, because it excludes anything kegged, filtered, force carbonated, or pushed with pressurized gas.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This leads to an interesting overlap where an unfiltered beer, carbonated by natural fermentation, could NOT be a real ale because it was kegged and served on gas.  Also, nothing prevents a large brand like Murphy's or Beamish (both owned by Heineken) from marketing a "Real Ale".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These definitions aside: It sounds like you may just be an IPA fan.  Your craft beer list is entirely IPAs.  It's not really accurate to conflate Craft and IPAs because plenty of craft beers are stouts, rye beers, Scotch ales, English bitters, or totally non-traditional things.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Another issue you might have with "Real Ale" is a technical note.  Because it's exposed to oxygen as soon as the cask is tapped real ale tends to spoil if it's not drank quickly.  The characteristic tastes of oxidized beer are cardboard, and the characteristic tastes of beer left on dead yeast for way too long is soapy.  I can easily see that coming off as "waxy", especially if it's warmer than you're used to drinking and you've just downed some IPAs.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer today is probably the best its ever tasted because of refinements in production techniques and farming.  Consumers are becoming interested in what their beer is made of so the quality of ingredients and care on a whole is improving.  But real ale is a niche,  there are going to be great traditional brewers making phenomenal beer, but it's prone to spoilage if not treated well.  There may also be those using it as a marketing gimmick.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And finally a last point about industrialization:  It has vastly improved the quality of ingredient and process that all brewers use.  The huge brands we now have, all started off as craft at one point.  But if they are no longer craft they either couldn't weather the market and faced the choice of no longer being a company or selling to a business and risk becoming more about business than beer.  In the US we have large breweries proving you can still be pretty big and make good beer.  Sam Adams, Stone Brewing, Dogfish Head, Yuengling, are HUGE by craft standards and haven't compromised the quality of their ingredients because brewers are still in charge.  Industrialization will never prevent a brewery lead by a passionate brewer from making interesting beer, but leaving brewing decisions up to a business man will always making boring beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From what I have researched, the term "real ale" derives from the original distinction between beer, which was brewed with hops, and ale, which was not.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The term real ale also relates to whether or not the drink was artificially carbonated or cask conditions. Craft beer is generally brewed with hops, although some craft brewers are trying to use other bittering agents. Likewise, there are craft brewers who use cask conditioning and even more so, bottle conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would say that "craft" beer is a rather vague term. The best way that I could distinguish between "craft" brewers and other brewers is through the use of "craft" or trade. Those who produce beer as a trade would be craft brewers rather as opposed to industrial producers. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In my experience, blanche and saisons are always beers that are enjoyed, even from people who are not beer lovers. 
					The scent of spices and fruit make them interesting, and the flavor is much more "traditional" than trappist beers (which are awesome, but also different).
					For a second try, I would go with IPA and APA (but they are much more bitter), and the aroma is more similar to tropical fruits.
					As a third, I would go with Belgian beers ("abbey" style), like a Golden Ale. You could try Chouffe, for example (or Affligem blonde). Sweet, round beer that has a wonderful malt taste.    &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;PS: I'm not suggesting particular brands as I understand you are in US, I don't know common brands there. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In my experience, different women have quite different tastes, but there are a few beers that seem to appeal to women much more than they do to men, so I'll try recommending those.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innis &amp;amp; Gunn&lt;/strong&gt; (original) is an obvious candidate. It's a very bland beer that's stored on American bourbon casks for a while. This gives it a strong, perfumy vanilla aroma. Some people think it feels artificial, but it's really not. It's the aroma of the American oak. Given that your friend loves vanilla it seems the obvious place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duchesse du Bourgogne&lt;/strong&gt; is technically a Flemish red. It's a sweetish beer that's been stored in wooden barrels so that it turns a little acidic, too. Kind of fruity, kind of vinous, little bitterness. It's really a classic beer, and while many men love it (me among them), even more women seem to like it. Really worth trying.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;German weissbier&lt;/strong&gt; is sweetish, not sour, not at all bitter, and has a gentle banana flavour that comes from the yeast. Again it's something that many men like, and more women. Good examples are Weihenstephaner, Paulaner, and Erdinger (in that order). US wheat ale might work, too, but they generally use normal ale yeast and thus turn deathly boring.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Belgian witbier&lt;/strong&gt; is similar to the weissbier, even though it uses a more neutral yeast, but then makes up for it with orange peel and coriander. Hoegaarden is the original, but there are many more examples you could try.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Belgian beer&lt;/strong&gt; in general is sweet and low on bitterness. Some good ones to try: Westmalle Trippel, Barbar, Chimay White, La Trappe (legally Dutch), Rochefort, St Bernardus. All of these are fantastic beers that sound like they should appeal to your friend.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Stone Smoked Vanilla Porter would be fun to try. The recipe was from one of their female brewers, which might pique her interest, too. &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/147/38446/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/147/38446/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine who doesn't really like beer (even chocolate stouts) tried the Framboise de Amorosa and really liked it. &lt;a href="http://lostabbey.com/beer/framboise-de-amorosa" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://lostabbey.com/beer/framboise-de-amorosa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you really want to get someone into beer you should avoid gimmicky fruit beers. At that point you aren't really appreciating the beer for the beer in my opinion, and there are plenty of options out there where fruity tastes play a role, but aren't artificial or dominating. But really what you want to do is get her exposed to some top-notch examples of the main styles and get an idea of what she likes and go from there. If we're skipping sours, pale ales and chocolate beer then here are some I always try to hit on with newbies:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Witbier - Light, Belgian wheat beer with orange peel and coriander. Awesome summer beer and one of the most accessible styles. Fruity flavor is just an accent more than the point of the beer.
					Great examples: Hacker Pschorr, Hoegaarden, St. Bernardus&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Dubbel - Dark, Belgian ales brewed with complex blends of malts resulting in deep, rich flavors and notes of dark fruits and spices despite lacking any of these ingredients.
					Great Examples: Cordendonk Abbey Brown Ale, Chimay Red, Rochefort 8&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;German Wheat - Lots of styles within this, but these tend to be a bit heavier than witbier with more of a spicy character and less citrus. These range from the extremely light weissbier to dunkleweizens to the heaviest weizenbocks.
					Great Examples: Weihenstephaner Weiss/Dunkel/Vitus, Schneider Weiss&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Bock - Traditionally the heaviest of lagers, dark and complex but more mild than stouts. Little hop character with complex malts.
					Great Examples - Weihenstephaner Korbinian, Ayinger Celebrator Dopplebock&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Others I might try are a good Coffee Stout Narragansett, a caramel porter like the Sam Adams Holiday Porter, and if you're really striking out with all these Abita's Purple Haze is probably the best fruit-added beer out there aside from sours.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I know i'm late to the party here but a good beer that is a sweeter beer but not fruity, is dark but not heavy, and has Chocolate and Vanilla flavors is Koko Brown from Kona Brewing. It's a toasted coconut ale. Very very good. Not overly flavored but you definitely notice the flavoring. One of my favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Any time you mix things into beer you'll lose some carbonation. Any powder would nucleate bubbles very quickly, so the flavoring should be in liquid form. The liquid should be as similar to beer possible: cold, equally carbonated, and not too much alcohol if it can be avoided. Stir gently in a cold glass and serve right away.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Or, if you are brewing the beer yourself just add it at kegging or bottling time.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are products called Randalizers that can allow you to infuse flavors into beer as it's served. Provided that the beer is 1) on draft, and 2) the flavoring is a solid (hops, peppercorns, citrus peel, etc). An expensive option is the &lt;a href="http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/blichmann-hoprocket.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Blichman Hoprocket&lt;/a&gt;. Another option I've seen, but I'm not sure how to construct it, was an inline water filter that had been modified. That modified filter also required significantly more CO2 to maintain pressure, I don't think that was true of the purpose built devices.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These work well for fresh flavors, but would serve poorly if you were looking for anything else. I've had beers run through a couple different combinations of herbs, fruit, veggies, and hops, and it was always interesting and exciting. Even if it wasn't always that good.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beers that are high in ABV, have been bottle-conditioned or have been barrel-aged are prime for aging and cellaring. Usually the brewer will say on the bottle or their website what the max amount of suggested aging time is. For instance, Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout state "develops over 5 years in the bottle." I bought a case of 2012 and have one about every 6 months...and they get better and better.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;They should have been kept at about 50-55 degrees over the time of aging. What did you have them at?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This largely depends on the person's tastes, but in general &lt;em&gt;one that tastes good&lt;/em&gt;. In my experience, most men I know are already beer drinkers, and most women I know have only been exposed to beer in the form of generics like Canadian, Bud, Coors Light.. etc (no introduction to beer at all, and likely a big reason why they don't like it). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The predominant character of these beers is that they're bitter and flavorless, so if that's what people don't like: move in the opposite direction. When I got my girlfriend into beer I introduced her to particulars like 'St. Ambroise Apricot Ale' and a 'Fruli'. She had no idea that fruity, sweet beers like this existed, and after trying enough of them she became more of a beer person.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So in general spiced or sweet beers are usually a good direction to go, but it also depends on the person's tastes. You might find they can jump to a complex and heavy beer quickly, but for most people they have to move gradually into this realm. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The malt is providing the sweetness and the hops are providing the bitterness plus the lingering flavour.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Depending on what type malted grains the beer is brewed will effect its sweetness. This is due to how much fermentatble sugar can be extracted from the grains, any non-fermentable sugars will stay in the beer and provide effect how the beer sweetness. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hops are used in different stages of the brewing process to provide different functions.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hops are added at the intial point of the boiling process (which is usually about 60mins) - The hops oils released from the hops at this stage provide the beer with head retention, bitterness and also natural perservative. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hops are then again added during the final stage of the boiling process (last 10-15mins) - At this point the hops are providing the lingering taste that you are noting, plus any aroma notes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would choose a wheat beer for start, mainly because thats what got me started in the "real" beer world (with Erdinger and then Paulaner to be more precise).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Mostly because they are not too bitter or complex, I find then accessible even to non-beer people, and they are still clearly beers, while many fruit beers (kriek for example) are so centered around the fruit that the beer part can almost be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would recommend starting with a draft Hefeweizen or Belgian Wheat, or a fruit flavored mead such as a blackberry or passion-fruit mead.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would also recommend pairing the beer with a good meal so the experience is not centered around the beer, the beer is instead an accent to the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This might sound heretical to the true aficionados, but why not try a „Bananenweizen“, which is a Hefeweizen (.5l), to which you add about .1l of banana juice. It’s refreshing, not too sweet, and might be a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Albeit being a purist, and preferring more bitter flavours (eg. Jever), I still enjoy this drink from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Well, when it comes to very hoppy beers nowadays, I can't help thinking about American IPAs. It's not even close to any german style, off course, but if you are looking for hops, that's the one style to go for.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there are some german microbreweries making IPAs there, like Hans Müller Sommelierbier's Backbone Splitter IPA, Ale-Mania's Imperial IPA and Crew IPA. I just don't know how available they are over there.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In general, german styles aren't so hop-forward, favoring balance over excess. Styles like Munich Helles and German Pilsners have a definite hop profile, which I find just the exact right amount to balance malt and compose the aroma profile, but nothing overwhelming like an IPA. The rare doppelstick style (double altbier) has a high IBU count, but just to balance the malt sweetness, which is massive in this style, and not to stand alone.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Californian brewery Stone is going to open a production plant in Berlin soon, so their beers will be available when it kicks off. And, just in case you aren't aware, Californian beers = loads of hops. So, keep an eye open.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is a variant of stout available in the UK known as Sweet Stout.   There is a version made by Sam Smith of Tadcaster in England who export to the US as Samuel Smiths Organic Chocolate Stout.
					The beer actually has organic cocao mixed in the brew.  It may well suit the tastes of someone moving into beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are trying to get a person who does not like beer to try beer, you are going to have to be creative and go for something a little more exotic. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Young's Double Chocolate Stout or &lt;a href="http://www.rogue.com/rogue_beer/double-chocolate-stout/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Rogue's Chocolate Stout&lt;/a&gt; would be my first two choices. My partner dislikes American beer, but really likes these two brands. In addition to Chocolate Stout, Rogue also has Pumpkin-flavor, Hazelnut-flavor, and Voodoo "Lemon Chiffon" Donut-flavor beer (and many others).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When my partner's first two choices are not available, we go fruity. &lt;a href="http://pyramidbrew.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Pyramid Brewery&lt;/a&gt; makes an absolutely delicious apricot ale.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;We were in a little brewery in Hannover and they had the best banana-flavored beer in the entire world. Now I know you are not going to be able to get this, but you might be able to find some banana bread beer in the USA instead. I have not tried this brand, but if it is anything like the beer in Hannover, your friends will probably like it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://drizly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/banana-beer.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Banana Bread Beer http://drizly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/banana-beer.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is a highly subjective question. It depends on the types of food they eat and what their preferences are taste wise. Ask them which notes within beer they find unappealing and what makes them cringe. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My wife hated beer because of the carbonation and forever nobody asked why they just suggested beers that she subsequently hated. Eventually I asked her why she explained so I went out and got an Allagash four and she loved it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is entirely subjective though and you will need to find the flavors she likes then tailor your approach around that.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Having the right shaped drinkware can improve the taste of beer.  For example, there's very specific reasons for the shape of a weizen vase, or a pilsner.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, more often than not unusual shaped glasses are about branding and nothing more.  In &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosteels_Brewery" rel="nofollow"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; wikipedia article it is claimed that the fancy Kwak beer glasses (which I like incidentally) were not launched until the 1980s.  IF that is true, their claim that it was designed for couchmen  unable to leave their horses rings a bit hollow...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I do think that although the flavor of your beer is paramount, there's a lot more to how you enjoy your beer than 'just' flavor.  Company, environment, and a beautiful glass or mug all contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My wife will try a beer mixed as a shandy e.g Badger brewery's Tanglefoot 1:1 with lemonade. This can take the hoppy edge off "beery" beers. Mort Subite or Kriek fruit beers are also a hit &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have tried Fullers (of London) Organic Honey Dew which is lightly flavoured with honey - its a golden ale with a light flavour.  Very refreshing.  I believe it's available generally throughout the UK and is imported to the US.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is another honey beer by a company called Hiver but I've yet to track down a bottle and even I won't make a trip to London for a beer.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've never seen a beer with cinnamon brewed in but I have had mulled ales with cinnamon added so the flavours are compatible, I'm sure someone has done it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are several beers with honey, some of them are quite famous.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For example the ones I know are from Belgium and France: &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;"Barbãr" and "Barbãr Bok" from the Levebvre brewery&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;"Bière des ours" from the brewery "La Binchoise"&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;"Bière de miel biologique" from the Dupont brewery&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;"Véliocasse" from the brewery "La bière du Vexin"&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The easiest to find are probably the ones from the Levebvre brewery.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I don't know any beer with cinnamon but I'm quite sure that it exists.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are LOADS of beers with honey and or cinnamon! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Using Ratebeer I could find 5 beers in Germany that have the word honey in their name. Start searching there, or just visit craft breweries.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Cinnamon beers would be more common in winter, again, from craft breweries and imports.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Do such beers exist elsewhere, in particular, in bottled versions?&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;American craft brewers use honey and cinnamon quite a bit, though not necessarily at the same time. Here are a few that might be available to you, but as is the case with a perishable product, your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/64/1587/"&gt;Dogfish Head Midas Touch&lt;/a&gt; is brewed with honey, barley malt, white muscat grapes and saffron.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.samueladams.com/craft-beers/honey-porter"&gt;Sam Adams Honey Porter&lt;/a&gt; uses Scottish Heather Honey.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://brooklynbrewery.com/brooklyn-beers/big-bottles/brooklyn-local-2"&gt;Brooklyn Brewery Local 2&lt;/a&gt; uses NY State Raw Wildflower Honey.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here are &lt;a href="http://brooklynbrewshop.com/themash/5-beers-for-national-honey-month/"&gt;a few more&lt;/a&gt; that utilize the sweet stuff for extra flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cinnamon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/302/26576/"&gt;Dundee Festive Ale&lt;/a&gt; is brewed with nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon and orange peel.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://cigarcitybrewing.com/wp-content/uploads/sales-sheets/hunahpus.pdf"&gt;Cigar City's Hunahpu's Imperial Stout&lt;/a&gt; brewed with Cacao nibs, ancho and pasilla chiles, cinnamon, and vanilla beans.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://sweetwaterbrew.com/brews/festive-ale/"&gt;Sweetwater Festive Ale&lt;/a&gt; has "a taint of cinnamon and mace".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Who could forget &lt;a href="http://terrapinbeer.com/brew/retired-bee/cinnamon-rolld-wake-n-bake/"&gt;Terrapin's Cinnamon Roll's Wake-n-Bake&lt;/a&gt;? Though I believe it is retired now.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If used the the brewing process,  the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;nicotine&lt;/a&gt; in the tobacco leaves would be extracted into the beer. Too high a nicotine dose in the beer would be poisonous.  The whole process would probably be more effort than it is worth.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As for tobacco flavor, it depends on the flavors that you enjoy in tobacco.  Just like some smokey whiskeys work well with cigars, some rich beers work just as well.  Strong beers aged in spirit barrels often contain the same oakey, vanilla notes that are present in the aged spirits.  &lt;a href="https://cigarcitybrewing.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Cigar City Brewing&lt;/a&gt; uses a lot of different barrels to impart tobacco like flavors in its beers and their tasting notes usually suggest pairing a beer with a cigar.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a smokey beer without the possibility of nicotine poisoning, then I suggest &lt;a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style22.php#1a" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Rauchbier&lt;/a&gt;.  Some of the malt used in this beer are smoked over different woods (usually alder). 
					Some breweries experiment with adding smoked malt to other beer styles (&lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/429/1769/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Porter&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/emelisse-innovation-serie-smoked-rye-ipa/195913/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;IPA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/777/what-gives-a-smoky-beer-a-smoked-flavor"&gt;etc&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I don't want chemicals (as in not natural grown plants) in my beer.    &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The standard natural ingredients are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;water&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;yeast&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;hops&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;barley&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To be a craft brewery in Texas you are limited to those ingredients&lt;br&gt;
					A good &lt;a href="http://thirstyplanet.net/beers/art-of-making-beer" rel="nofollow"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are different types of hops and barley.  The type and amount affect the flavor. Naturally the brew process, water, and yeast also affect the flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A hoppy beer will have more hops.  Link to &lt;a href="https://byo.com/resources/hops" rel="nofollow"&gt;hops&lt;/a&gt;.  An IPA is heavy on the hops.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Link to &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/101/malts/" rel="nofollow"&gt;barley / malt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There are also wheat and rye beers but I don't know much about them.&lt;br&gt;
					Brewers may use corn syrup and number of other ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Low calorie beer will naturally not use as much high calorie ingredients.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When yeast ferment the sugar into alcohol it produces a lot of different by-products that give beer most of it's flavour. The brewer can influence the by-products produces by controlling the temperature at which the fermentation takes place. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hops also add a lot in particular aroma. Since so much of tasting depends on the nose aroma comes of as flavour too. By boiling hops most of the aroma disappears and your left with only bitterness. By boiling hops for a shorter time, or not at all you can add more aroma. Brewers often talks about bittering vs aroma hops. Hops bitterness and aroma contribution depends on the variety of hops used. Hops growers are constantly coming up with new types of hops. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Malt, grain having been processed, also add flavour. Though most malt come from the same type of grain, barley, it can be processed/malted in many different ways giving a different flavour. When mashing (getting the sugar out of the malt and into the liquid) you can adjust the flavour by temperature. At high temperature (68c) you get almost only unfermentable sugar, which will give you a sweet result, while mashing at 64 will give you fermentable sugar and therefore a dry product. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Water does not add so much to the flavour in it self as it helps other parts of the recipe add a certain flavour. PH and content of minerals have a huge impact on mashing and fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My favourate Beer of all time is: &lt;strong&gt;Sublime Chaos&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Anarchy Brewery&lt;/em&gt;
					&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZAukZ.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZAukZ.jpg" alt="Sublime Chaos"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would say that This is my favorite beer for a few reason &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Rich Coffee Flavoring&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Not to heavy (for a stout)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Smells amazing&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I think when it comes down to the perfect beer it all comes down to an individuals preference some like a nice golden beer some like a wheat beer I personally love a stout or a porter &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For me tho a good beer is one that taste amazing, smells amazing and is a pleasure to drink not just drinking for drinking sake it has to be a beer you have a good time drinking  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A Great Beer is an opinion. Sure, you can look at &lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/top-50/" rel="nofollow"&gt;RateBeer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/lists/top/" rel="nofollow"&gt;BeerAdvocate&lt;/a&gt; and see the best beers according to votes, but does that really make it the best beer? &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A Budweiser can be the best beer in the world on a warm Saturday, but it will not score highly when you are sipping it whilst lying next to a large fire on a cold night.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A Westvleteren 8 is a phenomenal beer, but I would not like it, served at 4C on a hot day.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Your own likes will affect if a beer is great. If you do not like sour beers, then a beer like Cantillon Gueze might be a horrible beer for you, but others will rate it as one of the best beers in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is a whole class of drinks called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrub_%28drink%29" rel="nofollow"&gt;Shrubs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Shrubs usually involve a base syrup made from vinegar and fruits and spices and then mixed with a spirit. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Shrub syrups are &lt;a href="http://www.bonappetit.com/drinks/cocktails/article/shrubs-spritzes-swizzles" rel="nofollow"&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt; in a variety of flavors and there are plenty of recipes out there too for creating your own Shrubs at home. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My experience with and what I would define as a example Shrub would involve a shrub syrup, fresh fruit muddled in it with a spirit and then mixed, topped off with crushed ice and soda water. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are mixed drinks including vinegar or any other acidulated drink (usually called Shrub). Before adding to a drink as an ingredient, vinegar is often mixed/infused with fruits, spices, herbs.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are a fan of BIG beers.  Let me suggest the mother of all pumpkin beers, &lt;strong&gt;Avery's pumpKYn&lt;/strong&gt;.  I try to land a few bottles every year.  It is expensive, but it is not the type of beer one drinks several bottles of.  Each year, the ABV sits around 15 to 16 percent.  I like to say that this is the pumpkin beer that should end every other breweries' attempts to craft a pumpkin beer.  They should all stop and deem Avery the winner.  It is not just a little aroma of pumpkin, it is a mouthful of thanksgiving with each sip.  This beer is heavy and creamy and fills your nose with nutmeg and cinnamon.  Skip a meal for this one, it will fill your stomach.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you want to explore a wonderful variety of this brew.  I would suggest &lt;strong&gt;Avery's RUMPKIN&lt;/strong&gt;, which is their pumpkin ale aged in rum barrels. This is a bit more of a kick in the mount though, as it not only get's a great deal of sweetness from the rum, it also gets a bit more alcohol too.  Rum barrel aging is a unique process.  So you get to try something that is likely new to you.  So often, brewers use other spirit and wine barrels, but you do not see as many use rum or tequila barrels.  Kudos to Avery for that.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Both brews are priced around 10 bucks per 12oz bottle.  And you will need to shop at a specialty store for them.  I occasionally see them in Schnucks in Saint Louis though (which is a grocery store).  They are pretty rough when they are fresh.  So I like to grab a stock each year, then drink the ones I purchased the year before.  Age them upright at cellar temps, IN THE DARK.  I can not stress that enough.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy them.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When I didn't like beer, I was introduced to the Shandy. Just lemonade and a wheat beer... she may start out with a lot of lemonade, but over time there will be less lemonade and more beer, as she gets used to the taste. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can use any beer with lemonade and achieve a similar effect. I also like pale ale, or a lager that is light (not a light beer)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, I have a female acquaintance that swears by Hard Root Beer. It's less alcoholic than normal beers though.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;First, congratulations on getting bit by the homebrewing bug!  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can actually drop bourbon/scotch/whiskey into your fermented beer to add that flavor. Why after fermentation? To make sure you don't kill the yeast before they do their job. The hardest part is getting the right spirit to blend with the beer you're making. Darker beers tend to hold up to spirits better because of the unfermented dark roasted malts and robustness that off-set the alcohol you're placing in them. Dropping bourbon in a sour would probably be a waste of time, effort, and good alcohol.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Homebrewers more commonly use "other" ingredients to impart other flavors to beer that might not be approved for commercial use. &lt;a href="http://byo.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Brew Your Own&lt;/a&gt; has a section called &lt;a href="http://byo.com/mead/item/867-how-can-you-imitate-barrel-aging-homebrew-with-oak-chips" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Mister Wizard&lt;/a&gt; that addressed a little of this in one of the responses. This should kind of give you an idea of the "mad scientist" aspect of homebrew beer additives.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The same is true if one chooses to add oak chips to the secondary fermentation. After I got the brew where I wanted it with respect to beer flavor, oak flavor and aged flavors, I would begin to play with adding the wine or spirit component. This type of blending is always best done by preparing several samples of beer with varying levels of blended mixtures so that the flavor impact can be tasted over a range of concentrations. You may find that even a little of the planned flavor additive makes for a vile brew and you can avert a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, the easier and more repeatable version (albeit more money than most recreational brewers will care to spend) is to buy a bourbon barrel and let your beer age in them to absorb the bourbon-y goodness. &lt;a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/335/5428/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Dragon's Milk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/11036/51153/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Sexual Chocolate&lt;/a&gt; are two solid mentions (in my opinion). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;They make the exact product you are looking for. Home Distillers can add flavorings to their neutral spirits with these products. &lt;a href="https://stillspirits.com/collections/vodka-shotz" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Still Spirits&lt;/a&gt; I would look around the website as there are many different types of flavorings if you are interested.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's incredibly easy to &lt;a href="http://www.mademan.com/mm/how-infuse-vodka-tea.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;infuse vodka with tea&lt;/a&gt; - unscrew the cap, force a teabag through the neck, screw the cap back on, and put it in the freezer until you're happy with it (overnight is fine). Keep the tag outside so it's easy to pull out. Tea vodka is tasty, and also makes a great base for cocktails.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can also infuse it with &lt;a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/8406-horseradish-vodka" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;horseradish&lt;/a&gt;, or ginger, or any other kind of root the same way that you would with a fruit peel - slice it thin, chuck it in, and give it a day. Unsweetened cranberries are great, and cranberry vodka is very popular in Russia and Finland.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With the right infusions, you can turn your vodka into &lt;a href="https://www.craftginclub.co.uk/ginnedmagazine/2016/5/11/how-to-make-your-own-gin-at-home-no-still-required" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;gin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/20216/simple-syrup/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Simple Syrups&lt;/a&gt; can be a great way to infuse other flavors into your vodka. To add other flavors, you would add them into the simple syrup, mashing as you go along. &lt;a href="http://byo.com/hops/item/679-fruit-brew-part-2-techniques" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;You have to consider&lt;/a&gt; the temperature and amount of fruit to add to get the desired flavor. If you are trying to follow the simple syrup recipe and bring the sugar/water/additives to a boil ASAP, you shouldn't really lose any flavor. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From personal experience (and preference), strain the simple syrup with a &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0000VLVBQ" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;cheese cloth&lt;/a&gt;, or other straining device (&lt;a href="http://www.webstaurantstore.com/10-bouillon-chinois-strainer/40740PN.html?utm_source=Google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GoogleShopping&amp;amp;gclid=CLKBhdufz9MCFdccgQodKYwLtg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;chinoise&lt;/a&gt; mentioned below). This is especially true when making things like a &lt;a href="http://heatherchristo.com/2014/05/04/strawberry-habanero-margarita/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Strawberry Habeñero Margarita&lt;/a&gt; if you add the seeds in during the simple syrup process.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Recipe: Strawberry Habanero Margarita
					  Ingredients&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;• ¼ cup Strawberry Habanero Simple Syrup
					• ¼ cup Fresh Lime juice
					• 4 ounces Grand Marnier
					• 4 ounces Tequila
					• Strawberry Habanero Simple Syrup:
					• 1 cup sugar
					• 1 cup water
					• 1 cup strawberries
					• 1 habanero with seeds
					&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Instructions for Strawberry Habañero Syrup: &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. Bring everything to a simmer and let cook for about 5 minutes over medium heat.
					2. Strain the syrup through a chinoise and reserve juice. Discard the berries and pepper.
					3. Chill the syrup.
					&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Making the drink&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. Combine ice, the syrup, the lime juice and the liquor in a cocktail shaker.
					2. Shake vigourously and then pour into a chilled ice filled glass. 

					    Preparation time: 5 minute(s)

					    Cooking time: 5 minute(s)

					    Number of servings (yield): 2
					&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Granted - you're asking about Vodka infusions... This is my relevant experience with infusions and simple syrups. 10/10 will make this margarita again.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Certain people can have very individualistic headache triggers. For me it is second hand smoke. There are quite a few references on the internet tying Splenda to migraines so perhaps it so for you, at least in combination with alcohol. In any case, I'd pitch your experiment. Vodka typically has 65 calories per ounce. Sugar is about 111. However, you probably don't add that many ounces of sugar to your bottle of vodka so most of the calories will come from the ethanol. Some people substitute agave nectar which supposedly has a &lt;a href="http://www.allaboutagave.com/agave-vs-granular.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;lower glycemic index&lt;/a&gt; than granulated sugar and may be healthier.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I know of two methods:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add some aroma-containing plant-material (herbs, spices, fruit-peel, ...) into a bottle of vodka and let it rest to infuse. Remove when desired taste is achieved. An infusion with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierochloe_odorata" rel="noreferrer"&gt;bison grass&lt;/a&gt; is well known in Poland as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BBubr%C3%B3wka" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Zubrowka&lt;/a&gt;. Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;lemongrass&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;sage (mix result with lime-juice and sugar)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;orange-peel&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;juniper (that's kind of how gin is made, i fact just look at a list of &lt;a href="http://www.annodistillers.co.uk/content/dry-gin-botanicals" rel="noreferrer"&gt;gin-botanicals&lt;/a&gt; to get ideas)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;rosemary&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;cinnamon&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;safron&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dissolve some candy in a bottle of vodka. Where i come from a handful of blue mint cooler candy dissolved in vodka is called "&lt;em&gt;smurf pee&lt;/em&gt;".  Just use real candy made from real sugar and all the flavours are yours. It tastes awfully artificial, but a lot of people like it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I actually use skittles to add flavor to vodka.The process takes a while to complete the process and get all the flavor. I found instructions that seem to be the equivalent to what I do(except I use coffee filters). Separation of the skittles is key in my opinion but whow knows you may come up with a combination that you really love. I personally just buy a large bag from Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Winemakers can make either a dry wine or sweet wine. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the winemakers want to make a sweet wine, they must artificially halt the fermentation process by either increasing or decreasing the temperature in the fermentation tank to a certain level in which the yeasts cannot survive. Manipulating the temperature kills the yeast (well, actually they lay dormant) and it allows natural sugar to be left in the wine. The high sugar concentration of the grape plays a role, too. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is a second way to artificially halt the fermentation process, it is called fortification. Winemakers will add alcohol during the fermentation process to a level in which the yeasts cannot survive, also leaving natural sugar in the wine. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And by the way, Moscato is purposefully made in a sweet style which is why it is always sweet. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Moscato is a sparkling white wine made in the Piedmont region of Italy. It is made with Muscat (Moscato) grapes. They are fermented naturally until they hit 5.5% ABV and then the wine is run through a sterile filter to preserve the sweetness and stop fermentation. It's then artificially carbonated and put in a bottle. It's meant to be an dessert wine because of this sweetness. Also known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscato_d%27Asti" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Moscato d'Asti&lt;/a&gt; and there is a similar wine made nearby simply called Asti. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Gin is very simply defined as&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;a clear alcoholic spirit distilled from grain or malt and flavoured with juniper berries.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So your differentiation between "made properly" and "just alcohol and flavor" is meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Many of the finest gins are made by steeping juniper berries and other botanicals in the distilled spirit. Others are created by passing the newly formed vapour through a "botanicals basket" prior to condensation. Whichever way they are created, they are still gin.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So all the ones in your picture are "proper" gins. Many of them are really nice (that Caorunn is good.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Myself - I'm a big fan of the Gilt Single Malt Gin, as well as my own gin - the Metaltech (which is only for sale at our gigs.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what you mean by properly, but it seems like you mean "that you would like".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You could try reading &lt;a href="http://theginisin.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://theginisin.com/&lt;/a&gt; and getting a feel for if you agree with the reviewer based on what you currently like, then use his reviews as a jumping off point either positively or negatively.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;I believe that the only truly valid way it to try them.&lt;/strong&gt;  That said if your mixing the gin with tonic(and perhaps a lime), there is probably very little chance you can taste the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Many people think they are alcohol connoisseurs, but in truth very few are -it take real practice and training.  This idea has fascinated me for a long time and working over a decade behind a bar has given me insight.  &lt;strong&gt;It rings true for every kind of alcohol, varietal of wine, and type of beer.  Most people can not tell the difference.&lt;/strong&gt;  What I have here is anecdotal, but perhaps it can help to inform you.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I worked at a square bar with a partition in the middle(you could not see across the bar completely).  On occasion we would run out of something, bud light, Kendall Jackson, Patron, Crown, Tanqueray, Grey Goose etc.  If it wasn't too busy, On the order side of the bar, I would make the person something similar: miller light instead of bud, Cuervo Silver instead of patron, R&lt;strong&gt;ail gin instead of Tanqueray&lt;/strong&gt;, smirnoff instead of Grey Goose.  I would let them try it for a bit and then have another bartender ask what they were drinking under some pretense.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Never once did anyone notice or at least speak up, and this happened easily more than 100 times.  Afterwards I would tell them my "mistake" and offer to not charge them for the drink or buy them a round of the correct brand.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Less often, but still on occasion(dozens of times) I would hear someone talking about how only brand X will do and everything else is trash.  I would tell them that I don't think they can tell the difference and that I was willing to make a bet.  Their humiliation against a free drink.  I would fill 3 small glasses with enough liquor for a taste.  I would then put the bottle for their brand and two other bottles of a similar liquor in front of them.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The bet? They have to tell me what liquor is in each glass.  If they can, then they get a free shot(or sometimes more than one), if they can't they have to admit they can't tell the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would fill all three glasses with their favorite brand(never said I would use all three bottles).  &lt;strong&gt;If there was a mixer involved, not a single person figured it out,&lt;/strong&gt; even though a very large portion of players were certain they were right.  If the liquor was straight up, then about 10% - 15% could figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying there are no taste differences between gins- there are. For the uninitiated though, they are difficult to detect straight. When you mix it with tonic(or another mixer) many of the differences are completely lost and only practiced connoisseurs will be able to detect what they are specifically drinking.  Based on your question, it does not appear you fall into this category(most of us don't).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Mostly what you are getting with a certain brand is a feeling from ordering it, not a distinct flavor profile.  In that light, let go of the importance of taste and try to consider feeling. Ask yourself, what feeling are you trying to get for yourself?  You want the bartender to think well of you?  You want to feel like you are drinking something made with high quality methods? You want to feel superior to others? You want to recapture a memory?  You want to seem cool? You want to impress someone?  You want to feel like you are getting your money's worth?  Want to spend as little/ as much as possible?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Let the feeling you are chasing help you choose the right brand.  Alternatively, you could go about tasting all of these gins in order to gain the actual skill to know the difference.  However, this will take years and doesn't have much use in regular bar drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These stereotypes may very by locale, but just as a starting point:&lt;/strong&gt;
					Want to seem urban tough, try Tanqueray.
					Want to seem urban sophisticated, try Tanqueray 10
					Want to seem like you know a good classic, try Saffire.
					Want to show working class grit, try beef eaters or gordon's or rail.
					Want to seem informed or hip (depending on whats available), try Caorunn, Hendrix, or anything local or "small batch".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I expect I may get some kickback from some folks about difficulty of tasting the difference and I say to you prove me wrong.  Perform a blind taste test- mark the bottom of the glass with a label facing down and make sure to put multiples of the each brand in order to make sure you actually able to tell the difference and not just guessing correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiebell/2012/07/09/is-there-really-a-taste-difference-between-cheap-and-expensive-wines/#47d200783ae2" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Also, here is a link to relevant article(for wine not gin) that concludes that people can not tell the difference in brands.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would like to add that although I have not confirmed it I read somewhere the purity laws had less to do with "making great beer" and more to do with them being poor. They didn't want certain grains or things being used for beer as it drove up the price of bread and other foods. In the following article it is states they didn't want to waste valuable grains for beer: &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/04/0423deutsche-reinheitsgebot-german-beer-purity-law/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;April 23, 1516: Bavaria Cracks Down on Beer Brewers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I just add it at the secondary fermentation stage when I homebrew beer. I made a belgian style wheat beer and simply added some vanilla extract.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;edit : I just added some cloves to a dark beer brew when decanting it out of my fermentation vessel. Worked very well. Additions don't need to be a liquid. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beers (ales and lagers) are broken down into many, many different styles based on how they are brewed. Most beers have only 3 or 4 different types of ingredients. Malt, water, yeast, hops and sometimes fruit or herbs. While there doesn't seem like there can be a lot of variation, there are almost an infinite amount of ways to combine these ingredients. For the specific beers you mention, Brown Ale and Mild Ale are very similar styles. I'm not sure what you mean by "The Ale". &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.craftbeer.com/beer/beer-styles-guide#english-style-dark-mild" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Mild Ale&lt;/a&gt; vs. &lt;a href="https://www.craftbeer.com/beer/beer-styles-guide#english-style-brown-ale" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Brown Ale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;English-Style Brown Ale
					Style Family: Brown Ales&lt;/strong&gt;
					The English-style brown ale ranges from dryer (Northern English) to sweeter (Southern English) maltiness. Roast malt tones (chocolate, nutty) may sometimes contribute to the flavor and aroma profile. Hop bitterness is very low to low, with very little hop flavor and aroma. Known for rich and advanced malt aroma and flavor without centering too much on hops, the English-style mild is extremely sessionable and food-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;English-Style Mild Style Family: Brown Ales&lt;/strong&gt;
					Malt and caramel are part of the flavor and aroma profile of the English-style mild while licorice and roast malt tones may sometimes contribute as well. Hop bitterness is very low to low. U.S. brewers are known to make lighter-colored versions as well as the more common “dark mild.” These beers are very low in alcohol, yet often are still medium-bodied due to increased dextrin malts.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you want to dig deeper into this read the &lt;a href="https://www.craftbeer.com/beer/beer-styles-guide" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Beer Style Study Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As an example, &lt;a href="https://www.mccormick.com/spices-and-flavors/extracts-and-food-colors/extracts/rum-extract" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;McCormick Rum Extract&lt;/a&gt; has 35 percent alcohol, and lists the other ingredients as water, run, and natural flavor, in that order. Depending on the volume of your other ingredients, the alcohol content may become insignificant. Even imitation extracts, rum and others, contain alcohol. Bakery emulsions are an alcohol-free alternative, a water-based flavor concentrate, such as those marketed by &lt;a href="http://www.lorannoils.com/bakery-emulsions/rum-bakery-emulsion-0746-emulsion" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;LorAnn Oils and Flavors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You want a mildly flavored, low hop beer for something like this. I would suggest a Kolsch or Helles Lager or a Mild. Pilsners can be heavily hopped. I have done a lot of this with wines when I taught winemaking classes at a community college near here. We used very low aroma wines like a warm climate sauvignon blanc. You want the same for this since you don't want anything to get in the way of your samples. Also keep a small cup of coffee beans and water nearby to "reset" your nose and mouth between smelling and tasting. I wouldn't do two different beers it will muddy things. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You should definitely all use the same beer as the base, and you want a beer that has a good balance of hops and malt. The less flavor the beer has, the more the "spiked" flavors and aromas will stand out. Too much aromatic hops (e.g., an IPA) will mask the aromas. Too much malt will mask the flavors. A lighter, neutral beer is the way to go for an educational tasting.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I agree with everything farmersteve said except for the part about the coffee beans. That's an extremely strong flavor and aroma that will taint the beer tasting. As one who dislikes coffee, I can say that smelling coffee beans would ruin whatever beer sample I next tasted.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I would choose Coors. It's easy to get, always tastes the same so it makes for a good control. Also, it is light in flavor so it won't mask anything. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm not personally familiar with Foster's Gold, but a good site to find similar beers is &lt;a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Beer Advocate&lt;/a&gt;. If you search you can find their &lt;a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/575/76042/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;review page for Foster's Gold&lt;/a&gt;. On that page the style is listed as Euro Pale Lager. Click on that link to find &lt;a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/37/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;other beers of that style&lt;/a&gt;. There are quite a few familiar beers listed under this style. You can sort by number of reviews or average rating. Don't be too put out if your favorite beer isn't highly rated. Beer Advocate members tend to rate a bit harshly with mass market beers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Actually, yes. Though usually not with essential oils. In most cases, as an infusion. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For low-alcohol beverages: punch, some dry-hopped beers, vermouth &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For spirits: liqueur, gin, rumtopf, Chinese paojiu&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Compound gin is an example where essential oils might be used.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Foster's Gold is rebranded as something else. Beer factories do this often, a beer recipe is not forgotten just shelved or rebranded, like any IP. (I fix beer factories and heard that of this change, I forgot what is the new brand so check anything that is new from the same company) &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Refrigeration has little to do with preservation.  As a food product beer and NA beer are pretty strictly regulated for safety so as long as the rubber in the cap maintains a seal it should stay sterile.  Refrigeration is mostly for taste and carbonation.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Why do some wines taste salty?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Ed C. Kraus, a 3rd generation home brewer/winemaker and has been an owner of E. C. Kraus since 1999 has 4 possible reasons why a wine may have a salty taste. He has been helping individuals make better wine and beer for over 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;My first thought would be that if you are aging in a wooden barrel, the remnant salts from the sodium metabisulfite may have built up over the years through insufficient rinsing or no rinsing at all. But this is very unlikely. If you make any kind of conscious effort to rinse a barrel you would be able to keep up with the trace amount of salts that are left behind with each wine batch. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;My second thought is that a mistake was made in a dosage added to a wine/must. For instance, yeast nutrient (diammonium phosphate) would add what some would call a salty taste to the wine if too much were added, but this would take many times the normal recommend dosage.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Third would be saltiness from the grapes themselves. This could add a salty taste in wine. This could apply if you made the wine from fresh grapes from a vineyard. The mineral content of the soil is always reflected in the grape’s flavor to some degree. This is one of the reasons a grape’s origin is always noted. If you are making wine for the first time from a particular soil or terroir, then this is what could be going on.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The fourth thing that comes to mind is a mold infection. The only reason I left this for last is because it is the least likely of the four. This is because by the time the wine has a salty taste from mold, it is already blatantly obvious from a visual inspection that mold as set in. So if you don’t see any patches of dried crust on the surface anywhere, or a rainbow-ed, oil-slick look on the wine’s surface, the salty taste in the wine is not being caused by a mold.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Beyond these things the only thing that comes to mind is accidentally putting salt in the wine. &lt;/p&gt;
