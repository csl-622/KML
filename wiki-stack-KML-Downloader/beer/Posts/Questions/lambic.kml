					&lt;p&gt;There are a few fruit beers around how are these traditionally made?  I know they are all Lambics, but how are they made exactly?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I had a most-delicious, cherry-red beer last night that tasted like raspberries. It was tart, a little low in alcoholic content (4%), and tasted like no other beer I've had. It was intriguing enough that I think I'll go back for a growler today.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The chalkboard said it was a 'lambic'. What exactly is a lambic? What are typical characteristics of one? &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I quite enjoyed it, but it seemed a little sweet. Is there a variety of lambic I should keep an eye out for that is dry, but still tart?&lt;/p&gt;
