					&lt;p&gt;How long does an opened bottle of wine last in the refrigerator?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;(Simply plugging the cork back in that is, and not using any vacuum contraption.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I was always told that if I was going to cook with wine just buy a cheap bottle as it makes no difference once you cook away the alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Is this true or would a more expensive bottle give me more flavor in the food? Is there a big enough different to warrant spending a bit more money on a expensive wine rather than the cheaper bottle?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When I make mulled wine (wine heated with anise stars, citrus, and spices) I use Rex Goliath because at $6 a bottle, it's the cheapest thing I can get my hands on. But is there a better way? &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm planning on having some friends over next week, and since I really enjoy grilling I plan to make some good steaks for them. They like wines, I personally would just drink a cold beer considering the heat of the grilling and that we reach high temperatures this time of the year. And well the issue is that I know nothing about wines and how to combine them with different meals. But for the sake of not having a too broad question, I'd like to know which wine could go best with a steak and why. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wine was a cornerstone of ancient Roman cuisine and most Romans (including children and slaves) drank it every single day.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the past 2000 years, both grape cultivars and winemaking itself have evolved significantly. Is there a modern wine, commercially available today, that is intended to resemble ancient Roman wine as closely as possible?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The other day, I was in a specialty wine store and noticed several bottles of wines priced between $500 and $5,000!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Is there any way of knowing (historically or otherwise) that a particular exorbitantly priced bottle of wine is a well flavored wine? Or is this simply a marketing strategy?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I made wine last fall (2015) September and racked it one time.  After that
					I left it in the carboys.  It stopped fermenting and cleared.  I never bottled it, it's still in there with the airator top on it.  Is it safe to bottle.  It looks good and doesn't smell. I followed the directions to ferment it and racking it.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have a simple question. If you taste or read about wine, you encounter all kinds of flavours: butter, cherry, thyme etc. etc. But the grapes have never been in touch with butter, for example. Where does the variety of tastes come from? How can the grapes develop so many different flavours that remind real world stuff?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some regions around Frankfurt are famous for their wines. When I was in Frankfurt last time, I tried their Apple wine and simply loved it. This time, I will be in Frankfurt for a longer period and would like to try some more of their famous wines. I have not tried any special wines before and most probably will not spend a lot on wines. So please suggest something for a beginner within budget that is available in Frankfurt main city area.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;How do I find my favorite wine?  Obviously if I go drinking every bottle I can get my hands on I'd find one but I can't.  Also, I already know the general feel of the wine I'd like; i.e. dry, sweet, etc.  My question is, what are the things I should think about when trying to find my favorite wine?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When fermenting wine in a steel tank, should one put on the lid or should one leave it open?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Now as I understand, if it's open to oxygen, the yeast will multiply much faster and so the fermentation could kick on really fast.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;But can the yeasts still multiply if the lid is on (with a pumped up silicon tube but I left 20 cm or so air between the must and the lid)?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am unsure whether it is Cava or just regular sparkling wine? I know, Spain has strict laws, and it defines conditions to wine manufactures. I don't see any "Cava" word on official web site, and even on the label of the bottle. But there are many photos in the web with older vintage (for example 2008 or 2010) and its label has "Cava". I am confused. Does this mean, this manufacturer cannot label his wines with "Cava" anymore?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What could be a good alternative to either rum or gin to have with an evening meal (or lunch).  I do not drink wine or beer.  Vodka is well, to my thinking, just vodka, so I would like to find something that has its own taste without overpowering the food that it accompanies.  Any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What is chaptalization and why is it illegal to do to wine in some places? (Like France?) &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Is it at all dangerous to consume chaptalized wine?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What are the benefits (if any) of chaptalization?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;We sometimes do a friendly wine tasting. The idea is to discover good, well priced wines available locally - something that you might not have bought yourself.  Everyone brings a bottle, they are taken away by who ever is acting as sommelier for the evening, and then given a number. So, the whole thing is 'blind'.  Scores are given etc etc...  And eventual winners and losers announced (everyone also brings a small prize, so prizes are handed out as well).  The amount tasted is basically no more than a thimble or two,  there is no spittoon.  Would we get different results if we did, or is it OK to do this in our friendly tasting sessions.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Being a man of tradition and enjoying the finer things in life, I would like to have a nice romantic evening with my love next Valentine's Day (February 14). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However I would like to keep the choice of wine in keeping with a few points of Tradition.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;February 14 is in the Catholic world the Feast of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Valentine" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;St Valentine&lt;/a&gt; (226-269),from where we get the traditions involved with &lt;a href="http://www.history.com/topics/valentines-day/history-of-valentines-day" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Valentine's Day&lt;/a&gt; as well the Feast of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_of_Saragossa" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;St Vincent of Saragossa&lt;/a&gt;, who died in 304.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Both of these saints were martyred for their faith. St Valentine was a bishop and is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patron_saint" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Patron Saint&lt;/a&gt; of lovers and marriage. St Vincent was a deacon and is considered the Patron Saint of winemakers.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In keeping with the above information could anyone recommend a good traditional minded wine for a romantic evening on Valentine's Day?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With warmer weather upon us it is sometimes nice to just sit and enjoy a glass or two of fizz.  However, what to choose.  There are rows upon rows of fizzy wines and Champagnes in the shops.  It seems that there can be little difference between Champagne and Cava to the untrained palate. Is there a difference in production techniques?  Can the untrained or those not used to drinking such things taste the difference?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some time ago I was at a dinner with an oenophile who ordered an expensive bottle of red wine.  After a few sips, he noted that it was very "oaky."  I thought it was excellent, but I didn't smell &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; significant wood flavors.  After some puzzling and nosing each others' glasses it became clear that his &lt;em&gt;glass&lt;/em&gt; had an oak smell to it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It wasn't long before the sommelier confirmed this and began tripping over herself to apologize and make up for what was obviously a contaminated glass.  Thinking back on it I'm wondering: is it plausible that the restaurant was intentionally "salting" wine glasses with some sort of wood flavoring?  Is this a known practice in the industry?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;(Unless it was being stored in a working woodshop I'm having a hard time imagining how a fine wine glass in a restaurant would naturally acquire a notable oak flavor in the course of cleaning and storing.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Over the last year I've been getting more into wine, but not too extensively, only having bought bottles in the range of about $10 - $20 cdn. I've also sampled a good number of wines while dining out.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The thing I'm noticing is that while different wines most certainly have unique characters depending on sweetness, grape, and aging, &lt;em&gt;the variation in overall quality doesn't seem to be too high.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell wine, broadly speaking, can be broken down into two categories: good or cheap. A wine is either pleasant, or noticeably low quality, without much room to really go above and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So if my assumption is correct then 'fine wine' is a bit of a scam, as the diminishing returns price point seems fairly low.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I wonder, though, am I correct in my assumption about wine's diminishing return threshold?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylloxera" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Phylloxera&lt;/a&gt; plague of the 19th century devastated the grape stocks of Europe.  However,  Charles Valentine Riley and J. E. Planchon grafted the vines (Vitis vinifera) onto rootstock of an American native species (Vitis aestivalis).  In a nutshell saving the European vineyards and it's production.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is said that this 'hybrid' vine produced the same grape, as the rootstock does not interfere with the development of the wine grapes.  Is this true?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I bought a bottle of wine the other day, and when I attempted to open it, the cork crumbled to pieces! I was eventually able to dig a hole through the cork, and pour the wine (slowly) through a coffee filter. But for the future, I'd like to know:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Is there a more elegant way to open a ruined cork than stabbing it repeatedly and hoping for the best?&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Should I even be drinking wine like this? Does a ruined cork mean the wine has somehow spoiled? For reference this was a bottle from 2004.&lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Recently, I started a question on the diminishing returns of wine, which resulted in an answer that brought to light that any given wine is a 'work' dependent on a number of variables, such as, but not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Producer Choices&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Weather&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Soil&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Breeding&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Harvesting&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Legal Obligations&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The gist of the answer being that the production that has gone into the wine has a significant impact on the final product, with some production methods resulting in a high quality wine, and others resulting in a lower quality wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So my essential problem here is that if I go into a wine shop and am &lt;strong&gt;choosing from vintage wines where, grape variety, and sugar content are similar&lt;/strong&gt;, how can I choose between two bottles in a non-arbitrary, and objective way?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Should I be researching specific aspects of their production methods?&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Should I focus on who produced the wine?&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Should I focus on region?&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Should I rely on ratings of the wine?&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Or is the process of selecting a wine a bit of a dark art? &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Forgive me if my ignorance is showing here, I'd like to better understand the wine world and am starting from the bottom. I generally know which grapes I like and the differences between them, as well as sugar content I prefer, but in a nutshell I'm curious how one would choose between a set of different Cab Sauvs, or similar.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Living in Spain one tends to get used to good plonk at good prices.  However, now that I am based (for the time being) in the Canary Islands I come across a lot of Canarian wines.  One cannot call them plonk, firstly, they are somewhat superior to the average table wine on the mainland, also they have very fancy bottles and labels.  Now I understand that there is a lot of tourism here and a lot of this wine is bought to take home as gifts - so what percentage of the final cost (to the paying public) can be attributed to fancy labels and bottles - or is this wine really more expensive to produce?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As the question states, I would like to know what is the largest winery that supplies sacramental wine for the Catholic Church?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;By largest supplier to the Catholic Church of sacramental wine, I mean by volume sold to the Church in liters/gallons?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have noticed the proliferation in recent years of what most people refer to as 'plastic' corks in wine bottles.  It turns out not to be plastic, but Nomex.  My question(s) is (are):  What exactly is Nomex?  Is it a case of the fact that it doesn't leech into the wine?  Is there a standard/quality/bottle price issue regarding the usage of one type of cork over the other?  What other reasons are there for using a nomex opposed to cork 'cork'?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;EDIT TO QUESTION (visual of nomex corks):  The interior of the cork is sponge like, the out is hard.  I have tried googling this and cannot find what I am looking for.  It is not what passes for a synthetic cork.  Apogies for the quality of photo:

					&lt;p&gt;Previously I asked a question regarding nomacorc.  This has lead me to look more carefully at the corks that make their way into the boat.  Now assuming that we are prolific wine consumers (only for research purposes I assure you!), is there a way of knowing before opening/purchasing a bottle of wine if it is drinkable/good quality, or just plonk, from the cork?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have no experience in making &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_cocktail" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;wine cocktails&lt;/a&gt; and I would like a recommendation of a "rose" colored wine cocktail.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The wine cocktail I am looking for should be as close as possible to the color &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_(color)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;rose&lt;/a&gt; as possible. The color &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;pink&lt;/a&gt; is generally much lighter in color than that of rose.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_(color)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Rose&lt;/a&gt; is the color halfway between red and magenta.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Pink&lt;/a&gt; is a pale red color which takes its name from the flower of the same name.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If possible could answers include why one is making their recommendations, a recipe for usage and an image of the suggested wine cocktail or wine cocktails (if possible). &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am going to make some homemade fig wine this year and would like to know what pairs well with &lt;strong&gt;fig wine&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is the recipe I am planning to use: &lt;a href="http://winemaking.jackkeller.net/reques6.asp" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Fresh Fig Wine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The common fig (Ficus carica) is most often eaten as dried fruit and rarely used fresh. It's not very sweet, so a true fig wine requires a great deal of additional sugar for the fig juice to ferment to completion. This recipe makes one gallon and can be easily adjusted for another quantity. The special supplies for this recipe are readily available at stores that sell wine-making supplies. - &lt;a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_5415520_make-fig-wine.html?ref=Track2&amp;amp;utm_source=IACB2B" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;How to Make Fig Wine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, I read this article (&lt;a href="https://www.oscars.org/sites/oscars/files/89th-gb-francis-ford-coppola-wines.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA WINERY UNVEILS WINES TO BE POURED AT 2017 ACADEMY AWARDS® CEREMONY &amp;amp; GOVERNORS BALL&lt;/a&gt;) and it got me thinking if there exists a wine that commemorates a particular movie and could be paired with it?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Pairing beer with a particular movie is quite commonplace, but commemorative wines that could be paired to a particular movie is much more rare. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is a beer example of what I am trying to convey, but I am interested in wine only: &lt;a href="http://beerpulse.com/2014/08/the-hobbit-series-of-beers-ships-this-week-coming-very-soon-3434/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Hobbit Series of Beers ships this week, coming very soon.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://beerpulse.com/beer/the-hobbit-gollum-precious-pils/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Gollum Precious Pils&lt;/a&gt;: A strong Imperial Pils, with flavors as smooth and crafty as Gollum himself. Like the ring which Gollum pursued for the rest of his life, his “precious” pils, if your quest leads you to it, could extend your life too! (at least we’d like to think so) It will, at a minimum, make your journey a little more enjoyable!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've seen a few questions about what to do with some wines that have been in the refrigerator. I am planning on opening an unopened bottle of rainwater &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeira_wine" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Madeira&lt;/a&gt; (aged 5 years) that has been in my refrigerator for about 2-3 years. I received it as a gift and I live in a hot and humid climate where my job keeps me away for long periods of time, so I ended up storing the wine in the refrigerator, knowing it was not the best thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I finally have a chance to enjoy this wine in a few days but wanted to know how to best ready it for consumption, whether or not it should be aerated or decanted first, if there are any potential effects of refrigeration I should take into account when serving, and if there are any steps I should take to mitigate and bring out the best of this bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You can tell that the French take their wine seriously because of their wine laws. It may only be called Pomerol if it is from a small set of vineyards, and harvested by virgins at full moon at the south side of the hill or something rather. Very serious. But the wines are very good, and the Appellation Controlée does provide a degree of customer protection and quality guarantee that seems to work.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I live in Australia myself and although one of the most expensive wines comes from this country (Grange), I'm often left with a vaguely unsettled head and stomach after drinking Ozzie wine (no I can't afford Grange). Never a problem with European wines, or Argentinean organic ones for that matter. And other than prohibiting contamination with proven poisonous chemicals, there seem to be very few laws in making wine in most countries, I believe the same goes for American wine. It's allowed to boil wood chips and mix the extract with the wine to create a woody flavour, for instance, forget about rising in casks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So after this rather lengthy introduction, here is my question. How come that this vital issue escapes our attention? Why don't all of us demand strict wine laws? What should it be anything else than crushed grapes that have fermented with the little yeasty boys that live on the grape skins?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some years ago when I was in France, we would drink &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;soupe au vin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (wine soup) which was served extremely cold on hot summer days. Not being in France and the summer days are now getting hotter, I would like to make some soupe au vin myself. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is my intended recipe:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;ul&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One bottle (750 ml) of wine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water (500 ml)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar (100 g)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strawberries (600 g)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toasted bread in cubes to be added just before serving&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					  &lt;/ul&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can anyone make a recommendation of what sort of wine would be best?&lt;/strong&gt; The wine does not necessarily have to be red or French and if my recipe could be improved somehow please go for it. I simply recall that on hot summer evenings this was such a nice pleasant drink to have while using a bowl and soup spoon to drink it from. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;AFAIK, good distillers discard (or at least reduce) the head (typically the first 5%) of any primary distillation run because it is predominantly less desirable high-VOC compounds.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Is distillation ever used to remove these "head compounds" from a fermented beverage just to improve its taste?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For example, if removing the head improves our cognac, wouldn't removing it from otherwise finished wine also improve the wine?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've always thought of Malbec as being a French wine, however when visiting France, it appears to be quite uncommon. Does anyone know why is isn't popular there?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Red wine is a rich wellspring of a polyphenol called resveratrol, which goes about as a cancer prevention agent. It shields the cells of the body from harm and avoids perpetual infections. These cell reinforcements assume a noteworthy part in the anticipation of disease, including colorectal growth and lung malignancy.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Recent studies suggest that resveratrol found in red wine and red grapes may help in preventing age related memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As indicated by the discoveries of the diary Nature, wine restrains the union of endothelin-1, a supermolecule to blame of the operating of fats on the dividers of veins prompting to arterial sclerosis. Wine, in addition, has giant amounts of procyanidins, a category of phenols. that assume a section within the oxidization of cholesterol, decrease the danger of gas ailments.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What is the benefit of organic red wine over non-organic red wine?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm looking for a wine API with basic info (producer name, name, varietal, region, expert rating, description). Wine.com seems to have deprecated their API last month. I can't find any other ones from sites like WineEnthusiast and WineAdvocate.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Wine-searcher.com has one, but it costs $350 a month and they won't give it to me temporarily (I'm just a student building a prototype app).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Anybody know of any?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have kept a text file of wine notes for years. Each entry is like:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Wine #1 maker and wine name
					Date #1: Notes and cost
					Date #2: Notes and cost
					etc.

					Wine #2 maker and wine name
					Date #1: Notes and cost
					Date #2: Notes and cost
					etc.
					&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I don't rely on any online knowledge on wines, and am not looking to do so.  That's why I entitled this question using the word "personal wine notes".  I also don't wish to rate each wine.  My notes will tell me what I need to know.  Depending on my mood when I review the notes, I may decide to give a wine another try.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What I need is to be able to sort the entries by: (i) date of last try &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; (ii) alphabetically.  The former lets me see the most recent wines I tried without being hampered by wines that I tried years ago.  The latter lets me look up a specific wine that I may come across, or that someone may have recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I would like to access the "database" of notes from both my desktop/laptop and my smartphone, and I don't want to go through any cloud service (other than webmail, e.g., gmail).  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The apps that I've read about don't cater to these deceptively simple requirements.  As someone who mashes data in my day job, I can envision a some partial conceptual solutions.  For example, if I had a Microsoft Access database, then each wine can be a single entry in a data table of wines, which links to a table of notes.  The notes table will have a date field and a field for text notes (including cost).  I can then write some code to associate each wine with the date of its most recent note, then sort by either that most recent date or by the wine identification text.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is fine if I only want to look up the database on the computer, but it does not permit updating on the smartphone.  What works for accessing from phone and computer is to maintain a &lt;em&gt;draft&lt;/em&gt; email in my gmail account, which I can access from both the phone and the computer.  But it doesn't allow for the sorting described above.  I've basically entered wines in chronologically.  Sometimes, when someone recommends a wine, it's hard to check whether the wine is deep down in the text file (from years past).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I got tired of that, and took a text mashing editor (vim), made all the entries into one physical line of text, with delimiters separating the different date entries, sorted by wine name, then converted each entry back to the multiline format illustrated above.  Without a database, however, I can't re-sort the wines by date of most recent trial.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Is there a solution that permits the sorting that I want (by wine or by date of most recent trial), accessible for update or lookup from both desktop/laptop and smartphone?  Avoiding the cloud would be preferred.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My favourite wine is a blend of Gewürztraminer and Riesling which (from what I can find) seems to be exclusively made in Australia by Rosemount and Hardys. This wine is becoming harder and harder to find in the UK and is therefore much more expensive when I do find it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, both Gewürztraminer and Riesling wines are fairly readily available.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering if I could buy the two "component" wines and just mix them myself to achieve 2 bottles of the blend. Is this equivalent to how the manufacturer achieves the blend, or do they blend the juice before fermentation? Either way, will I make a reasonable version of the blend, or will I ruin two completely good bottles of wine?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;These canned, additive-free cherries are packed in their own juice, watered down.  I previously left this juice in a plastic water bottle while drinking it, for only three days, and it became pleasantly bubbly - carbonated juice.  A honey and water mix used for eye medicine turned into a strong alcohol over just 1-2 weeks (it was only one ounce of mixture).  This time, I used the extra, way-too-high amount of yeast to put in the juice, but after two months, it is still just sour juice, and no tasteable bubbles.  So I added a very small piece of kombucha SCOBY - maybe it will become kombucha-like or become fuzzy juice.  One week later, it tastes exactly the same.  Two weeks after that, it is vinegar.  It was never wine and it was never kombucha.  Why?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A friend of my family gave us an unopened bottle of Bollinger champagne from 1979. It is a vintage champagne. Is it safe to drink? As far as I understand, the worst that could happen to alcohol is that it turns into vinegar. However, we opened it and it does not take like vinegar. It lost all the fizz, and tastes a bit like cheap wine + sweet (desert) wine. But we are not sure it is safe to drink. Any advice?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Nowadays do grapes squeezed/stomped for juice extraction like Adriano Celentano did it in the "The Taming of the Scoundrel" movie? Do some wine-makers still use such method of juice extraction for their exported wines?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think stomping is not hygienic. But I'm afraid that some wine-makers still use such methods with respect to traditions.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Commercial wineries sometimes (often?) &lt;a href="https://www.winebusiness.com/tools/?go=winemaking.calc&amp;amp;cid=5" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;dilute the grape juice with water before fermentation&lt;/a&gt;.  This is done (according to that page) because the grapes have too much sugar and can kill off the yeast and malolactic bacteria.  I've been &lt;a href="https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/88614/blessing-over-a-wine-water-mix/88616#comment285717_88616"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; that wineries that do high-end wines don't dilute, but others do.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;People have been pressing grapes into wine for thousands of years.  Of course, precise control over the yeast and the process is more modern.  I'm not an expert, but I've seen some medieval and renaissance research, including recipe redactions, that didn't call for dilution.  I used to be part of a brewing club that made some of those recipes, and they didn't taste unusual to me.  (Of course, yeast selection might have played a role there.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What drove the need for dilution?  Is it that the yeasts that are now preferred (or even available) are more fragile?  Are we cultivating grapes with more sugar now?  Are we now able to engineer more parts of the process that previously fell to chance, and that's somehow involved?  Have tastes changed and historically wine was much different in taste or strength?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I came into possession of a bottle of fortified wine - it says on the label "Premium Vintage Angove's 1995 Port".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I happened to be at Angove's cellar door doing a tasting and I mentioned to them that I had the bottle at home, and the person behind the counter gave me the impression that it was not likely to be worth keeping / drinking (without saying as much).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is little information that I can find about this wine on the internet, which leads my to my question": would it be possible / likely that this wine would be drinkable and possibly good?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is the bottle in question:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My initial SG was 1.090 and now reads 1.026, this should give me an ABV between 8.4% and 9% but the vinometer is reading 16%, and I have a stuck fermentation with Montrechat (Premier Rouge) yeast (max 13%).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I purchased a Montepulciano, added 80 grams of honey and some pepper, and then put it in the fridge. A glass of it after 24 hours seemed to me more alcoholic than what it was originally. 
					Is it psychological, as I had read this was the case (but can't find the source right now, and I tend to think it's not true), or is the increase of ABV real? &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherry" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;method to produce Sherry&lt;/a&gt; and the respective Brandies, called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solera" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Solera&lt;/a&gt;, uses several layers of barrels (frequently four layers). From the lowest layer they take the annual amount they want to sell and refill from the respective layer above. The layer on top is refilled with the newest production. So every Sherry and Brandy produced in this way contains at least (four?) year old wine or spirits, but also much older components of the first year of production, which means that you may expect a drop of first production year in each bottle. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is why you will not find a year of  grape harvest on the bottle labels.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, except those mentioned in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solera" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; I do not know any other winery or distillery working in that way. I know some that blend (mix) different products at the end of production, but that is not the same.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In Germany it is a tradition to drink warm wine in Winter called Glühwein, especially during the weeks before Christmas. Additional ingredients are (among others) cinnamon, clove, star anise and cardamom. When cooking it should not produce bubbles. Some people like to add a shot of rum, whisky or Amaretto.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Are there other countries with comparable warm wine drink traditions for winter?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A brief explanation with &lt;strong&gt;beers&lt;/strong&gt;: I love &lt;strong&gt;IPAs&lt;/strong&gt;, but some of them are a disgrace to the kind, when I'll buy some, I look for the &lt;strong&gt;alcohol&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;IBU&lt;/strong&gt; level, so &lt;code&gt;I know I'll like&lt;/code&gt; the beer before I even buy it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I discovered that I also like &lt;strong&gt;some&lt;/strong&gt; wines, more precisely cabernet and &lt;strong&gt;malbec&lt;/strong&gt;, but unfortunately I don't find every malbec tasty. Doesn't matter if it's red or white, I like some and dislike others. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've been looking for a way to know if I'll like the malbec wine or not, but most of the tips I find tell me to memorize the "wine factory" I like the most, but I don't think it's a good method. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Is there a way, a measure, like the IBU, or some other characteristics, that can help me to see if I'll like the &lt;strong&gt;malbec&lt;/strong&gt; wine or not?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;PS: I'm good with the cabernet, as for now, I've liked every one I tasted. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I recently moved to a new city in Austria and have noticed that many (but not all, so it’s definitely not a problem with my taste perception) of the local red wines taste salty. I’ve tried red wines both on the cheaper and expensive side and they all give off this salty taste. Almost all that I’m referring to are Blauer Zweigelt variety. 
					Is this salty taste coming from the grape variety, or could it be something else like my glass or detergent (I make sure that I wash the glass very thoroughly)?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;After seeing this question once again on this site &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/5071/is-there-a-modern-wine-that-is-designed-to-resemble-ancient-roman-winemaking/5076#5076"&gt;(Is there a modern wine that is designed to resemble ancient Roman winemaking?)&lt;/a&gt; sometime back and I became interested in knowing if there is a modern wine that is designed to resemble &lt;a href="https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-sites-places/biblical-archaeology-places/did-this-winery-get-noah-drunk/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Noah's wine&lt;/a&gt; from the Turkish region of Mt. Ararat after the biblical deluge? I am not interested if one believes in the story of Noah's Ark or not. Nor am I interested in any possible historical timeline for the great regional flood which spared Noah and his family.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Noah's wine is a colloquial allusion meaning alcoholic beverages. The advent of this type of beverage and the discovery of fermentation are traditionally attributed, by explication from biblical sources, to Noah. The phrase has been used in both fictional and nonfictional literature. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Noah's wine"&lt;/strong&gt; refers to alcoholic beverages. In the Bible, the few chapters that come between the creation of Adam and the birth of Noah contain no mention of alcoholic drinks. After the account of the great flood, the biblical Noah is said to have cultivated a vineyard, made wine, and become intoxicated. Thus, the discovery of fermentation is traditionally attributed to Noah because this is the first time alcohol appears in the Bible. Noah's wine has been described as a "pleasant relief for man from the toilsome work of the crop". &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;From a biblical view, fermented beverages presumably spread throughout the world after Noah's supposed discovery, as alcoholic beverages are historically widespread. - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah%27s_wine" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Noah's wine (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a modern wine, commercially available today, that is intended to resemble the ancient Noah's wine as closely as possible from any of his many possible &lt;a href="https://answersingenesis.org/bible-timeline/timeline-for-the-flood/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;timelines&lt;/a&gt; (more or less)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thetorah.com/noahs-original-identity-the-first-winemaker/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Noah’s Original Identity: The First Winemaker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fBbIE.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fBbIE.jpg" alt="A depiction from the Holkham Bible c. 1320 AD showing Noah and his sons making wine"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A depiction from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holkham_Bible" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Holkham Bible&lt;/a&gt; c. 1320 AD showing Noah and his sons making wine&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I was looking up a wine and found out that one of my favorites received a Gold medal. I felt validated because that meant I wasn't crazy (all of my friends disliked it while I fell in love), so I  thought that meant it was in the top tier of quality. But as I kept scrolling I found one that had received a Double Gold medal and it brought me much confusion. I didn't know there was a ranking above gold?!? And I've definitely never heard that term before. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I thought that if there was, it would be called something similar to platinum (like records in the music industry), but apparently not. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So what is a Double Gold medal? What makes it better than a normal Gold medal?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.indyinternational.org/competition/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is where I came across it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have a bottle that has been standing opened in room temperature for a while, and has become a bit sour.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;How do I make it into vinegar?&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;How long time does it take?&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Any precautions/instructions I should follow?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With the weather deteriorating and temperatures dropping my thoughts drifted to mulled wine.  Traditionally a Christmas treat, but is it 'fashionable or OK' to drink it even in the summer, or will my dinner guests be appalled?  Are there any Summer Mulled wine recipes, and if so do they use drastically different ingredients?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;MULLED WINE BASIC RECIPE:
					1 (750 ml) bottle of dry red wine.
					1 orange, sliced into rounds.
					8 whole cloves.
					2 cinnamon sticks.
					2 star anise.
					2-4 tablespoons sugar
					optional add-in: 1/4 cup brandy (or your favorite liqueur)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Winter is just around the corner, thus what should I be drinking?  My normal summer tipple of Gin and Tonic, or should I move over to darker more homely drinks, like perhaps rum and coke?  Is there a particular wine that is evocative of cold days and warm fireplaces?  Or perhaps I should just simply remove ice from gin and carry on - any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have some question about wine.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;1.Which brand of wine is best and economic respect to New York? How much it cost?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;2.Normally what percent of alcohol is there in wine?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;3.What is the difference between red and white wine?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;4.Which one is better for a novice?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I know all  this answers are available in internet. But I still write here because I hope the answer I get from here is come from some personal experiences.
					So this answer will be more acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.   &lt;/p&gt;
