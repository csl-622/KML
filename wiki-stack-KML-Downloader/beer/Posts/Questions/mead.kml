					&lt;p&gt;I have done a little home-brewing (with friends) and have made or helped make several meads over the years -- enough to prompt this question but not enough to provide sufficient data to answer it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some of our meads have kept well for several years.  Others have started to go off after six months or a year (but were fine before that).  The meads are bottled in capped (usually) 12oz brown bottles stored in a dark basement, and it doesn't seem to be about individual bottles.  This seems to be a case of "some recipes keep longer than others".  I'd like to know what properties contribute to this.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So far, the batch that has kept well for the longest (over 10 years now! I've been saving the last few bottles...) was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; high-gravity for a mead; it's strong, sweet, and very smooth.  But another moderately-high-gravity mead degraded after a year or so, and lower-gravity ones have sometimes lasted longer.  So it seems like there must be other factors at play; it doesn't seem to be as simple as "stronger (or sweeter) meads keep longer".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Our production techniques have been about as consistent as home-brewing can be -- same equipment, same general process, same cellars, same fastidiousness about sanitation.  Varieties of honey and yeast have varied, and of course recipes have too.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is not a home-brewing question; I'm not asking specifically how to &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; long-lived mead.  Rather, I'm asking what characteristics allow a mead to age longer without going off, which also helps me decide what to drink.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I know that commercial meads exist, by the way, but I have never encountered one.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A lot of Iranians would gladly push away their teetotal laws, and it's evident from the latest alcohol craze which makes me realize there are probably more and more Iranian rummers present in our society, doing God's job, or lack thereof.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I want to know what sort of yeast do you use? I want to brew myself some mead. In a large barrel. What should be the ratio of water and honey, and also, what yeast should I use? Where can I get brewer's yeast?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Based on my research it seems like mead just flat out doesn't spoil, but since I didn't see this specific question here I thought I'd throw it out there to confirm.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I bought a bottle of mead just under a year ago, that I've had sitting in my kitchen since then. Initially it likely spent most of it's time at room temperature, and being exposed to sunlight every day. Then in the summer it would have been exposed to temperatures in the 90's and up for a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Before I open it and try it, I wonder if my bottle is likely to be bad? And if not, are there other ways it can spoil?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I found online an ancient recipe for mead, given by the Spanish-Roman naturalist Columella in "De re rustica":&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Take rainwater kept for several years, and mix a sextarius (around 1/2 litre) of this water with a [Roman] pound (about a 1/4 kg or half pound) of honey. For a weaker mead, mix a sextarius of water with nine ounces of honey. The whole is exposed to the sun for 40 days, and then left on a shelf near the fire. If you have no rain water, then boil spring water.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've read that mineral water of low fixed residue is suitable for this. My questions are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What are some tips (like the container, how to close the container)? How does the whole process work? How about the sun exposure part in winter?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I want to home-brew some mead because why not , plus it seems pretty easy to do.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My question is :&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Can any mistake in the brewing process make the drink "poisonous" ?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This is my first time homebrewing. I'm making mead with apples but noticed that some of the sliced apples lies above the liquid level.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Do i need to push them down?&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Will the apple rot and spoil the mead if i dont?&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Is it necessary to siphon the mead to other containers to continue fermentation? I've seen some videos where people do so but I had no idea why.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Do I need to add campden tablets once i am done with the fermentation?&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
