					&lt;p&gt;Most mass-market beers come with expiration dates, and cease to be good for drinking if too much time has passed since they were brewed, even if they've been stored in unopened containers and good conditions. Some major breweries even have long-running advertising campaigns about the freshness of their products.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Other beers improve with age. What qualities make a beer suitable for cellaring or bottle-conditioning? How can I know whether a given bottle of beer can be aged, short of looking it up online?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've got an extra room in my house that I was thinking of turning into a "beer cellar", or as much of a cellar as an above ground room can be. I don't have a problem with the actual construction, but especially since I'm in Phoenix, Arizona, I was trying to figure out how to insulate and cool the room for optimum storage.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also, should I build the shelves to store both 6 packs still in the original cardboard casings along with individual bottles, or should I plan to remove all bottles from packaging? Separate temperature control? Lighting considerations?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One final consideration, should I keep all bottles of similar size on separate shelves, or should I have more open shelves for more air flow around bottles?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;On &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cellartracker.com/Default.asp" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.cellartracker.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; you can declare which wines you have purchased and their vintage, etc. There is also a "drinkability"/"drinking window" field where you can recommend when a particaular wine should be opened. This is a valuable feature for vintage wines but for non-vintage it is completely useless unless specifying which year the wine was bottled/cellared.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the recommendation when adding NV wines to my cellar?&lt;/strong&gt;
					Is to create a new wine (based on the existing NV wine) and add the designation (Mise en Cave 20xx)? Has this been discussed?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I came into possession of a bottle of fortified wine - it says on the label "Premium Vintage Angove's 1995 Port".&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I happened to be at Angove's cellar door doing a tasting and I mentioned to them that I had the bottle at home, and the person behind the counter gave me the impression that it was not likely to be worth keeping / drinking (without saying as much).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There is little information that I can find about this wine on the internet, which leads my to my question": would it be possible / likely that this wine would be drinkable and possibly good?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Here is the bottle in question:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lkzim.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lkzim.jpg" alt="Front of the Bottle"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
					&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AbOaQ.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AbOaQ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I cannot vouch for how it has been kept over the years, all I know is I've had it for four years or so but have never dared open it.&lt;/p&gt;
