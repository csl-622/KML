					&lt;p&gt;I live in Pennsylvania, where the folks in charge cling desperately to the last vestiges of Prohibition, with a protection racket on the side.  What this means is that the state heavily regulates alcohol import and distribution.  Wine and hard alcohol can only be bought from stores run by the state, and beer is largely sold through licensed distributors.  (I'm not counting ordering single servings in bars/restaurants; that's a separate matter.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I recently learned that PLCB (PA Liquor Control Board) has opinions on which beers can be sold in the state.  On a recent trip out of town I had a local beer that I liked, but it's not on &lt;a href="http://www.lcbapps.lcb.state.pa.us/webapp/registered_brands.asp"&gt;the approved list&lt;/a&gt; so I can't buy it here.  This led me to wonder how PLCB decides -- is there some sort of certification they depend on, or does it depend on breweries paying a fee to sell in Pennsylvania, or what?  I could find nothing on their web site that explains how these decisions are made.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;How does the PLCB decide what beers I'm allowed to buy here?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My local brewery fills growlers and just adds a twist-off cap to the top. They do not place any kind of seal or sticker on the cap to prove it hasn't been opened.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So if I get pulled over for whatever reason and the cop sees the growler, in say, the backseat, is this considered a crime? Even if the growler hasn't been opened since it was filled and no beer was removed?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What makes this different than a six pack with twist off caps?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I live in Pennsylvania, so answers from a PA perspective will be most useful, but even just a general feel from law enforcement's view would be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm looking for distributors/shops close to central Pennsylvania that sell Okocim beers such as Okocim Porter, Okocim Beer, or Okocim Mocne.  I've seen O.K. Beer around here (another Okocim product), but the branded Okocim beers are what I'm really interested in.  I don't mind driving a bit either, but hopefully something in or around the state...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's about that time of year again, when pumpkin flavored beer (and everything else) starts making its way onto store shelves.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I was wondering, what pumpkin flavored beers are out there, if any, are made with actual pumpkin and not just pumpkin pie spices?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My personal favorite is Pumpkin Head by Shipyard, but I've been unable to find any evidence that would suggest it is made with real pumpkin. Are there readily available beers made with real pumpkin? I live in western PA, but any brand not specifically available here would be good to know.&lt;/p&gt;
