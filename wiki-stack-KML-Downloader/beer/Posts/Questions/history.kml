					&lt;p&gt;I have heard of something called 'gruit' which seems to sometimes be used in brewing beer.  What is it?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Why are there very few beers on the market containing gruit?  What are some of the more popular ones currently?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Do hops have (or had in the past) any use outside of brewing beer?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I mean: In the question of &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/2/when-was-the-first-beer-ever-brewed"&gt;dating first modern beers&lt;/a&gt; we have the first record of cultivating hops predating the first record of use of hops in beer by nearly a century. Could the hops have been cultivated for any other purpose than brewing, or can we safely assume if they were cultivated, there was beer made with them?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I know that there may be some debate raging over this today, depending on what side of the Atlantic one is on, but there seems to be a clear point in history when beer went from being enjoyed warm to warm beer being undesirable. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm assuming some of this had to do with the advent of refrigeration, but in what era in America was the serving temperature more likely to be cold than warm?  Has a similar trend occurred in Europe and other parts of the world?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've seen quite a few recipes for this old Polish soup based on beer, egg, cheese and some other ingredients but all of them call for "beer" or at best "light beer". I don't doubt most make a rather tasty dish but I'd like to aim at historical accuracy. While probably Seasoned Advice will be good with the rest of ingredients, I'd like to ask about the beer choice:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Which of beers currently in trade would most resemble what was brewed in Poland 300-500 years ago? What traits, properties, brands should I look for, that are most true to the antique recipes?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One thing I have noticed around South-East Asia is that the primary affordable dark beer is Guiness.  This appears to be due to high beer tariffs and the fact that Guiness has breweries all over (for example in Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, and more places).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;How did this come to be?  How did Guiness come to expand so far and wide?  Was it during colonial days or later?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Yeast was identified as the cause of fermentation in the 1800s, but beer has been around since long before then.  How was fermentation started before the intentional introduction of yeast?  Was it all lambic-style ambient yeast, or what?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the US there are tons of rules about alcohol that vary widely from state to state and at the federal level. For example you can brew your own beer in most states but you have to have a license for liquor. Similarly, wine tastings are usually OK but beer tastings are illegal in many places.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm not asking about the specifics of how each law came to be, that would take an encyclopedia. Rather, I want to know if there was an overall philosophy that drove regulating beer differently from other alcohol. Did different companies or industry groups lobby for laws that benefited their product over other companies products? Was there an overall public sentiment that drove the differences?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The "Beer in Australia" article on Wikipedia, includes a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_in_Australia#Beer_glasses"&gt;table listing the names for various size glasses&lt;/a&gt; in the different states.  One peculiarity is that some South Australian glasses are one size down compared to the equivalents in other states.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For example, it lists their pint glass as three quarters of an imperial pint (which would be called a schooner in other states that use that size), and their schooner glass as half a pint (which would be called a middy in a number of other states).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So my question is how did this discrepancy occur?  The Wikipedia page includes a number of references that indicate that these names have been used in SA, but doesn't indicate why.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I understand that a much weaker version of beer, called 'small beer', was historically drunk as a safe way to drink liquid. This was at a time when drinking plain water might well have made you sick, as it would not have been boiled. Do we have any idea what the ABV of 'small beer' drunk around 1800 would have been?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://www.theyardofale.com/index.php/history/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, though they do not cite their source:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;The origins of the yard of ale date back to the early 17th century, during the reign of King James I (1603-1625). Glass-making in England was then in its infancy; the first glass-making factory had only recently been established. Many of the first yard glasses have not survived due to their brittle nature, until George Ravenscroft (1674) introduced a new glass process known as the flint glass.&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;The yard of ale was made and used not for normal drinking purposes, but for feast and manly displays of prowess. During Anglo-Saxon times through the Middle Ages, the English nation has always engaged in the traditions of heavy drinking. As put in Young’s quote “England’s Bane” written in 1617, “He is a man of no fashion that can not drink by the dozen, by the yard, so by measure we drink out of measure.”&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Legend suggests that the yard was also used in old England to serve the driver of a coach. Upon arriving at their destination and relieving its passengers, the coachman would stay and the length of the yard glass would allow him some refreshment.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some of the same information is repeated in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yard_of_ale"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm certain that most of the history of using this style of vessel comes from fellow drinkers trying to show each other up at parties, but aside from the sheer volume (and perhaps limitations of glass-making artisans), how did this length and volume of the glass first come about?  Is there more definitive evidence for the year of birth of the yard, besides the milestone in their history of the introduction of flint glass? &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm also curious about whether the volume of the glass was satisfying to stagecoach drivers because of their need to wait long periods for their passenger, or whether it was just easier to hand them a tall glass as they remained in the seat. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've always wondered what the strongest beer in the world is and how would taste.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Are there reliable historical records of a very strong beer? What would be the highest % alcohol that's Brewable for a beer? And also of course it would be great to know where to get such a beer from. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I was recently at a local craft beer festival and I tried a few shandies (my favorite was &lt;a href="http://travelerbeer.com/beers/time-traveler/"&gt;Time Traveler&lt;/a&gt;) and now I'm starting to get into them as well. But I've heard mixed things about their history. Some people say it goes back hundreds of years and others say it's a much more recent phenomenon. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With that said, why do they have such a bad reputation? They always seem to score low on &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/search/?q=shandy"&gt;beeradvocate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com"&gt;ratebeer&lt;/a&gt;. To me it seems as though people are rating them as beers rather than what they actually are, shandies.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It seems that &lt;em&gt;Ginger Beer&lt;/em&gt; has no barley, no hops, no wort, no malted anything; so why is it a "beer"?  Seems like it is closer to a cider.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Abbaye Bier (Abbey Beer) refer to monastic beer brewed by monks. And there is almost Trappist beer brewed by monks but specifically from Trappist monasteries. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what is the difference in terms of brewing process, resulting product and historically, why are they different?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The iconic mass-produced lager in Queensland, Australia, is XXXX (pronounced FourEx). On their label, they tell a story about how historically beers were marked with a number of Xs to indicate their quality, with three Xs being the best.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;According to XXXX, the original brewer found that his beer was so good that he added a fourth X.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So what's the real story with the 'X' mark? I know there are other beers, such as Dos Equis, which incorporate an X in their name and branding. I have also heard of a number of Xs being used with whisky as a crude ABV indicator.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I was picked up by someone on another SE site (unrelated) when I used the phrase "Some beers, like mead...(blah blah)" - Apparently a mead isn't a beer.  I'm good with that in the pedantic sense that it's &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt;, but I wasn't intending to be quite so specific, and was merely suggesting that I was not talking about spirits etc.  It got me thinking about the definition of what could, or could not be called a beer, and whether a beer is an actual drink at all, or just the name of the group of drinks that we call beers, but which really have more specific names and definitions.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The key phrase for me, in understanding it from a simple taxonomy point of view is that alcoholic drinks are essentially either &lt;em&gt;Beers Wines or Spirits&lt;/em&gt;.  That's my starting point, which may well be rudimentary at best and wrong at worst&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Using this definition, a Mead must clearly be a beer in the most basic definition; it's certainly not a win or spirit?  Obviously under beer you then have ales, lagers, ciders, perrys, meads, stouts, bitters and probably a million others, and probably further sublevels (dry cider, sweet cider, sparkling cider....), but is there a second level "beer" also at this level?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Really, is there actually a single specific drink that is a &lt;em&gt;beer&lt;/em&gt; that is not further defined as, for example, an IPA, or a Stout?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am editing an academic economics paper (I'm a grad student), and I ran across the following line:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Schlitz changed preservatives, which led to green flakes in the beer.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The paper references an article --- amusingly titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=xe7Ye5bw8wgC&amp;amp;pg=PA321&amp;amp;lpg=PA321&amp;amp;dq=schlitz%20hit%20the%20fan&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=P7scBc9ggZ&amp;amp;sig=hYi3R5FykZWjVvbwTmYbbBVlxoY&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=fZ2WU-OUNM3eoATA8ICwBA&amp;amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=schlitz%20hit%20the%20fan&amp;amp;f=false" rel="nofollow"&gt;Why the Schlitz Hit the Fan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; --- which makes the following claim:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;In 1976, new Food and Drug Administration regulations regarding which ingredients needed to be printed on the bottles prompted Schlitz to change the preservatives it used (it had been using silica gel). The company did not spend sufficient time testing the new process, and tiny green flakes appeared in the beer.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Internet sleuthing reveals &lt;a href="http://www.beerconnoisseur.com/the-fall-of-schlitz" rel="nofollow"&gt;this &lt;em&gt;Beer Connoisseur&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt;, which gives more info and claims that the flakes were, in fact, white:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Schlitz decided to use another beer stabilizer instead, one that would be filtered out of the final product and thus would not have to be listed as among the ingredients. Unfortunately, what Schlitz's brewing technicians did not know was that the new anti-haze agent, called Chill-garde, would react in the bottles and cans with the foam stabiliser they also used, to cause protein to settle out. At its best this protein looked liked tiny white flakes floating in the beer and at its worst it looked like mucus, or "snot," as one observer bluntly called it.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;After more research, I can't find any other references to Schlitz being [literally] green. As a beer lover and homebrewer, this inconsistency is driving me nuts. Does anyone know &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; color the flakes in Schlitz were in the mid-1970s? I have the following hypotheses:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beer Connoisseur&lt;/em&gt; also mentions that Schlitz switched from whole to pellet hops; coupled with inadequate filtration, this could have led to green flakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults doing research thought of "snot" like kids, which meant that a "snotlike" substance in beer was probably green.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a misunderstanding created by non-brewers reading that Schlitz was "green" (which does appear frequently in search results); combined with knowing that there were flakes, and that the liquid of beer is generally amber-ish, it must have been [to someone unfamiliar with "green beer" being beer which needs to be further aged] that the flakes were literally green.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beer Connoisseur&lt;/em&gt; is wrong, and the flakes were in fact green.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have first-hand experience with this era of beer?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;During the past couple of years, the variety of beers found in supermarkets in Germany has vastly increased.
					There is a number of beers that I remember having always been there, and a few have been added over time. But these don’t stick out much in price or flavour.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Recently, I heard the term micro brewery for the first time, and I noticed that large supermarkets have stocked up on many different (mostly regional) beers. Prices start at “slightly above average”, but some are easily ten times as expensive. A bottle of beer for 7 Euros? Not the most expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This, and the fact that beer.stackexchange.com exists, and that many questions concern micro breweries and craft beers leads me to the questions:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Why this sudden interest in micro breweries and craft beers? When did it start?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Consider the map of per capita beer consumption by county &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_beer_consumption_per_capita"&gt;from Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cfaj7.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cfaj7.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Zooming in on Europe, something that jumps out is that France and Italy consume much less beer than their neighbors:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kpcx2.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kpcx2.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What has caused these two countries to be pretty much surrounded by other countries with higher beer consumption? I would imagine to some degree this is caused by replacing beer consumption with wine consumption, but what led to these regional differences in alcohol preferences?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In all the years of my life (except when I was a minor), I've never tasted beer that's not bitter. So was beer conceived to be a bitter drink? What factors in the bitter taste of beer?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I recently read Stephen Buhner's "Sacred and Herbal Healing Beers" wherein he claimed that hops were a fairly new way to bitter beer in the renaissance and that in England Henry VIII outlawed them. However, I have not been able to find substantiation of this in the historical record. It makes for a great story, but is it true?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've got a case of beer, which is Rivet Beer. Each can is 330 mL, &amp;amp; 4.7%/1.2 standard drinks. They ran out of date on 13 November 2015, &amp;amp; it's been in a cupboard the entire time, room temperature. Are the cans safe to drink? I'm not concerned about bad taste or anything, I just don't want to get sick. Any help would be appreciated! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I was wondering why there are so few trappists and how is it that from the eleven trappists 6 of them are from Belgium. Why aren't the breweries more spread over the world? Does it have something do to with what happened there in the history?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So from a previous question I learned that the Trappist foundation was founded in 1997 by 6 Belgian breweries one from the Netherlands and one from Germany. But were there other breweries which succeeded to the conditions for the label of Trappist. I mean, it sounds unfair for a brewery in France that six of the founding members are from Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;And are those original founding members still the people who control the label? Then it sounds still unfair today, because they can easily keep the number of breweries with the trappist label low, just for marketing reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This question might be a bit broad, but what I'm trying to understand is generally how the brewing process and the subsequent end result differed before the early-modern to modern era. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I had asked a question here some months back on where I could find some historical styles of beer, but without having much luck I thought I'd try to get at least an understanding of what's known about the evolution of beer from ancient to medieval to modern times. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So the question is&lt;/strong&gt;: if I was a European medieval man drinking beer circa 6th-15th centuries what would that beer have been like? How did it differ from what we've been brewing for the last few centuries? And is that product distinct from what existed in ancient times?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I recently purchased a new pewter Tankard with a glass bottom and a silver shilling encased between the two bits of glass. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;After a little bit of research, I discovered that this was one of the ways recruiters would trick people into joining the British Army or Navy, but there is also a lot of places that say this is just a legend!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Does anybody know the true origins of the shilling in the bottom of the tankard and is that why they started to produce tankards with glass bottoms so people could see if they did have a shilling in them?  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In ancient Russia the way to measure "proper" strong spirits was to burn it - if the volume decreased by half than it was considered right one. How can I convert this into modern days alcohol percentage? Also, as a side note, how accurate this conversion would be? I mean which factors besides actual alcohol percentage would affect the process - ambient temperature? humidity? atmospheric pressure? And to which degree: +-1%? 5%?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heracleum_(plant)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Heracleum&lt;/a&gt; or cow parsnips are high-latitude plants that can produce severe inflammation in humans. They seem like the last thing someone would want to ingest. However:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://kamchatka.org.ru/eng/aboutK/flora.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Flora on Kamchatka: flowers and grasses&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Puchka (Heracleum dulce) is an insidious plant. Its juice has a sweet taste, but leaves blisters and sores on the skin that ache for months! ... Cossacks distilled wine that produced a strange effect: after two or three glasses a person saw wonderful dreams, but in the morning felt so miserable as if he had committed a crime. &lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What are some of the historical ways that people have employed to conceal alcohol on their person?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;We have all heard of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition"&gt;prohibition&lt;/a&gt; of 1920 to 1933 in the United States and other countries. How is it that people were able to conceal alcohol on their persons? In this context, &lt;strong&gt;I would like to know the historical ways people did so prior to 1950.&lt;/strong&gt; The question is not limited to the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;We know that hiding alcohol was done in bootlegs and books, are there other known methods that people historically used to hide booze on their bodies?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Bootleg (n.)&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;Look up bootleg at Dictionary.com "leg of a boot," 1630s, from boot (n.1) + leg (n.). As an adjective in reference to illegal liquor, 1889, American English slang, from the trick of concealing a flask of liquor down the leg of a high boot.

					&lt;p&gt;I read yet &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_in_Japan" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; on Wikipedia and some small articles.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The articles didn't satisfy my curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;My question is:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the history of brewing in Japan?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Please, take in mind following sub-related-questions:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;• Since the brewing techniques were imported, how did the brewing techniques evolve?&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;• Have the Japanese maintained traditional techniques or invented some new
					  ones?&lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;• There have been cases where they have combined European
					  techniques with ancient Japanese fermentation techniques - was this before the arrival of Europeans?&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylloxera" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Phylloxera&lt;/a&gt; plague of the 19th century devastated the grape stocks of Europe.  However,  Charles Valentine Riley and J. E. Planchon grafted the vines (Vitis vinifera) onto rootstock of an American native species (Vitis aestivalis).  In a nutshell saving the European vineyards and it's production.  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is said that this 'hybrid' vine produced the same grape, as the rootstock does not interfere with the development of the wine grapes.  Is this true?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With all this in mind, what proportion of wine (today) is made from grapes from hybrid vines, and is there really any taste/quality difference?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;We all know that that many people drink to the legendary person of &lt;a href="http://www.wrdw.com/content/news/Saint-Patricks-Day-The-History-Myths-and-Traditions-Explained-416411623.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;St Patrick&lt;/a&gt;.

In other words, the pairing must associated to a particular event within a legend or myth. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Many of us here will follow this tradition at times like New Year's Day, Christmas, weddings and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Commercial wineries sometimes (often?) &lt;a href="https://www.winebusiness.com/tools/?go=winemaking.calc&amp;amp;cid=5" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;dilute the grape juice with water before fermentation&lt;/a&gt;.  This is done (according to that page) because the grapes have too much sugar and can kill off the yeast and malolactic bacteria.  I've been &lt;a href="https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/88614/blessing-over-a-wine-water-mix/88616#comment285717_88616"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; that wineries that do high-end wines don't dilute, but others do.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;People have been pressing grapes into wine for thousands of years.  Of course, precise control over the yeast and the process is more modern.  I'm not an expert, but I've seen some medieval and renaissance research, including recipe redactions, that didn't call for dilution.  I used to be part of a brewing club that made some of those recipes, and they didn't taste unusual to me.  (Of course, yeast selection might have played a role there.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What drove the need for dilution?  Is it that the yeasts that are now preferred (or even available) are more fragile?  Are we cultivating grapes with more sugar now?  Are we now able to engineer more parts of the process that previously fell to chance, and that's somehow involved?  Have tastes changed and historically wine was much different in taste or strength?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am an amateur in the topic, so I was wondering, can all edible fruits be turned into a fruit wine? Why have grapes historically become the main fruit for wine making over other fruits? &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;After seeing this question once again on this site &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/5071/is-there-a-modern-wine-that-is-designed-to-resemble-ancient-roman-winemaking/5076#5076"&gt;(Is there a modern wine that is designed to resemble ancient Roman winemaking?)&lt;/a&gt; sometime back and I became interested in knowing if there is a modern wine that is designed to resemble &lt;a href="https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-sites-places/biblical-archaeology-places/did-this-winery-get-noah-drunk/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Noah's wine&lt;/a&gt; from the Turkish region of Mt. Ararat after the biblical deluge? I am not interested if one believes in the story of Noah's Ark or not. Nor am I interested in any possible historical timeline for the great regional flood which spared Noah and his family.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;Noah's wine is a colloquial allusion meaning alcoholic beverages. The advent of this type of beverage and the discovery of fermentation are traditionally attributed, by explication from biblical sources, to Noah. The phrase has been used in both fictional and nonfictional literature. &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Noah's wine"&lt;/strong&gt; refers to alcoholic beverages. In the Bible, the few chapters that come between the creation of Adam and the birth of Noah contain no mention of alcoholic drinks. After the account of the great flood, the biblical Noah is said to have cultivated a vineyard, made wine, and become intoxicated. Thus, the discovery of fermentation is traditionally attributed to Noah because this is the first time alcohol appears in the Bible. Noah's wine has been described as a "pleasant relief for man from the toilsome work of the crop". &lt;/p&gt;
  
					  &lt;p&gt;From a biblical view, fermented beverages presumably spread throughout the world after Noah's supposed discovery, as alcoholic beverages are historically widespread. - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah%27s_wine" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Noah's wine (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a modern wine, commercially available today, that is intended to resemble the ancient Noah's wine as closely as possible from any of his many possible &lt;a href="https://answersingenesis.org/bible-timeline/timeline-for-the-flood/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;timelines&lt;/a&gt; (more or less)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thetorah.com/noahs-original-identity-the-first-winemaker/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Noah’s Original Identity: The First Winemaker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Are there any historical cases where actual &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_of_war" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;POWs&lt;/a&gt; made some form of alcohol while being held prisoner by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belligerent" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;belligerent&lt;/a&gt; forces in a POW camp?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While watching the classic movie &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057115/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Great Escape (1963)&lt;/a&gt;, I noticed that there is a scene in which three POWs made some moonshine out of potatoes. You can watch this scene on YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md2GFtBCIh8" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Are there any documented cases of POWs making some form of alcohol under the noses of their enemy while being held in a POW encampment?&lt;/p&gt;
