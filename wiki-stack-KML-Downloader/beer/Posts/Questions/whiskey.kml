					&lt;p&gt;Whisk[e]y varieties often have significant differences in how long they are aged.  While there are always exceptions, Bourbon is often aged for 5-10 years. Scotch, on the other hand, is more commonly aged for 10-20 years.  Why is this?  &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some whiskys (for example &lt;a href="http://deanstonmalt.com/our-whisky/deanston-12-year-old"&gt;Deanston 12&lt;/a&gt; ) say on their label that they are "Un-Chill filtered" and in the example case follow that up with "exactly as it should be" which implies that there are some negative effects to chill-filtering whisky.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the Scottish whisky market there has been a level of controversy over the last couple of years relating to "Non Age Statement" (a.k.a NAS) whisky.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Several of the leading distillers now have NAS whisky in their line-ups for example &lt;a href="https://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/the-glenlivet/glenlivet-founders-reserve-whisky/"&gt;Glenlivet Founders Reserve&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/the-macallan/the-macallan-gold-1824-series-whisky/?srh=1"&gt;Macallan Gold&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This has led to critism of the distillers that they're trying to pass off younger spirit at a premium price.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I was wondering what the pros and cons of NAS whiskies are?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I received a bottle of &lt;a href="http://highlandpark.co.uk/shop/einar/"&gt;Highland Park Einar&lt;/a&gt;.

Given there is no age statement, would anyone of you who tried it be able to tell what's the approximate age of this scotch? Does it even matter in this case?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Also: &lt;a href="http://www.bestshotwhiskyreviews.com/2013/06/highland-park-einar-review.html"&gt;I have read&lt;/a&gt; it has been developed by the marketing department, not by the distiller. Does that mean in general anything in regards of the quality of the whisky?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if anybody could give me the differences between a whiskey  and bourbon, as I was in a conversation the other day and we were talking about Jack Daniels. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It is a bourbon but a lot of people still call it a whiskey. We got into a lot of different discussions about it, such as where it's made (USA vs. UK) and what goes into it (different barley) but we couldn't all agree on one reason.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So can anybody tell me what the difference between these drinks is?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm not a wine man but I believe the general rule is to keep the cork wet, although the story is entirely different with whisky due to the effect of its high alcohol content breaking down the cork.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If the rule for whisky is to store the bottle upright, will it not suffer the same fate as wine stored upright? Assuming I open a number of bottles for enjoyment rather than waxing the seal for longevity, how can I make my spirits last?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;for clarification, this question is focused on whisky that comes with a cork and by extension what to do with the cork, not whisky storage in general.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am a big fan of the peatier Scotch whiskies, such as Octomore, Lagavulin, Laphroaig and Talisker, but aside from describing them as "really peaty" or "wow, so much smoke" it can be incredibly difficult to describe a particular whisky to someone who hasn't drunk it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Is there a scale, so I can just say, "That's a 7" and be understood?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've noticed that on the label on some whiskey bottles it say "distilled 2010 |Â bottled 2016"&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Is a Whiskey in that case then categorized as a six-year-old whiskey or one-year-old (or zero) whiskey?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm getting a daughter this year and I would love to buy a bottle of whiskey from the year she is born (which of cause if this year, 2016) but the only whiskey I can find is where it's bottled 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I know that, in general, Scottish whiskey is peaty because of the way they dry the malt with peat smoke while Irish whisky is not because they use unpeated malt.  Is the difference legally established in these two countries or is it convention?  Can an Irish distillery make Scottish whiskey and vice versa?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A lecturer of mine, who is quite a beer connoisseur, mentioned boilermaker shots/cocktails when lecturing about methods of yeast fermentation. Given he's quite into beer, I'm sure when he talks about a boilermaker, he's got a particular one in mind that would go well with a shot of whiskey. I'm not quite at the same stage of knowledge, and would like some recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Now I know you could put any whiskey and any beer together and it'd still be a boilermaker, but I'm wanting to find a pairing that works quite nicely - a dark ale and a smokey scotch? A pale ale and an Irish whiskey? As fun as it would be try every combo, I only have so much beer and so much whiskey, and could use a jump start.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I am Australian by the way, so I might not be able to get my hands on any particularly specific recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Something I've recognized in the past year is that popular Asian whiskies exist. And yet, I've never purchased whisky from Asia, usually only picking up bottles out of Canada, the U.S. or Britain. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So I wonder, what is the whisky market like across Asia, what styles of whisky are they producing, and what are some of the more popular distilleries producing medium to high quality product?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Assume I know how to properly ferment grain and distill it into whisky, and that I have all the necessary equipment. If I want a "sour mash" whisky, how would I go about it?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;From a bit of research, it seems that the term "sour mash" simply describes some sort of process where the distiller saves a bit of the old mash (maybe he/she "cultures" it somehow, to grow enough live yeast?) and adds it to a new batch to facilitate fermentation?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Is there anyone familiar with the process who could describe how to apply it to an existing hypothetical small-batch whisky making operation?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In the past few years I've become a whisky fan boy, buying bottles in most styles, including Scotch. This question pertains mostly to Scotch, but other styles can be included too.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;One problem I've found is that I'd like to buy more upper tier bottles (in the 100+ Canadian) range, but I'm hesitant to do so without actually sampling these whiskies first.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This poses a problem because the city in which I live doesn't give me much opportunity to sample whiskies in this range. The end result is that I can't really know if that 150 dollar bottle is worth it, or if I'm just burning my money.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, &lt;em&gt;I wonder if there is a common way to determine the objective quality of a bottle in this range, without actually trying the bottle first&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I really like my alcoholic beverages cold. But I do know most whiskeys should be served in room temperature. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Although adding ice is an option, I do not prefer this method because when ice melts, the whiskey is mixed with water.
					Using &lt;a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/images/products/zoom/ba37_whiskey_stones2.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;whiskey stones&lt;/a&gt; is good for drinking at home, but I cannot carry my stones around (for instance in a bar).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, what type of whiskey is served chilly so I can order that one when I go to a bar?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Last year I went to Dublin to visit guinness storehouse and some whisky distillery.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As long as Guinness is such a masterpiece, I found myself attracted more by the whiskey, which was a surprise...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;During the tour in the factory I got an explanation on how it is supposed to drink whiskey to get all flavors and odors, but , shamefully, I'm not a native speaker, so I got just basic help, and I'm pretty sure I did not get something about respiration.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So, as long as enjoying whiskey is not a cheap option, and I would want to drink it and enjoy it as it is supposed to be done. Are there any rule or advice on how to drink properly whiskey?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;At times it can be difficult to procure what I always considered the correct ingredient for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zabaione" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Zabaione&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsala_wine" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Marsala&lt;/a&gt;.  However, I have discovered that I can use other fortified wines or spirits.  Wikipedia suggests Cognac - which got me thinking about a good smooth whiskey - such as - &lt;a href="http://www.whiskysuggest.com/whisky/redbreast-12-year-old/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Redbreast&lt;/a&gt;.  I don't know enough about whiskey to make the right choice here - would a cheap brand do just as well?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I like a gin or 2, but tend to stick to the 37.5% stuff opposed to the stronger stuff.  I don't get any extra taste, just fall over quicker!  I understand that for some of the better whiskeys a little bit of water will bring out the taste.  At what point does the % become a problem for taste?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burns_supper" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Burns Night&lt;/a&gt; it is traditional to have a 'wee dram' to drink with your &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haggis" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Haggis&lt;/a&gt;.  I am serving Haggis to some Scottish friends, and as it is not Burns Night I feel that I can forgo the traditions of whiskey with Haggis and serve another spirit/wine.  What would be a good alcohol pairing for Haggis? &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This term was used in a TV show recently and was referring to the price of another highly prized liquor by saying it was worth 3 or 4 stacks of whiskey. 
					The show was a recent episode of NCIS Los Angeles. In very last scene they sat down to a toast with Hettie.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A simple enough question. If we take any given style of whisky on the lower end of the spectrum, and we compare it with a fine Scotch, what is it about the production of the two bottles that causes one to be more palatable and easy to drink than the other?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I learned of a popular Japanese whisky, Yamazaki 12. Since then I've been searching, and searching for methods to get my hands on a bottle, but have come up empty-handed.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Being in Ontario it would seem that the only legal method of obtaining any type of whisky is via the LCBO, and so I'm at the whims of what they have in stock. I've looked into online suppliers but it would appear that none of them can legally ship into Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So outside of leaving Canada, and bringing a bottle back in, is there a way to get my hands on any given Japanese whisky?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've just recently begun drinking Scotch, and I find it absolutely delicious. However, most brands I see in the store are quite expensive. So far the best Scotch I've tried is Aberlour single malt, and although it's not prohibitively expensive, it's not exactly cheap either. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What are some good brands of Scotch that won't break the bank? &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I have this classic bottle of Jack Daniels, 1 liter. Before serving it, I planned to chill it down a bit in a freezer (-17Â°C) for couple of hours. 
					I know the alcohol freezing point is way below commercial -17Â°C (1Â°F), but I wonder is there any chance the bottle might burst inside the freezer? &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I had some bursting of the spirits before, though those spirits were lower in the grade. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Today I was looking at buying my first bottle of whiskey since I got a liquor store gift card worth of $50. I enjoy whiskey so I figured this would be nice to buy. I was looking at for example Blanton's Bourbon and after doing some research, I found out that Blanton's Bourbon is marketed by Sazerac Company and distilled at Buffalo Trace. After looking further, I found out there are only about 13 actual distilleries in the USA which most of them produce multiple brands.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;question:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Take my Blanton's example. What does it actually mean that it is done by multiple companies? Does this mean I can also just buy a bottle of Buffalo Trace whiskey for the same taste and pay less? Also, who gets to decide the taste, if it's different at all? Blanton's or the distillery itself? I'm kind of confused at this moment and before I spend my gift card I'd like to get some clarification of why things are done this way. Right now I feel like the "sub brands" like Blanton just buys from Buffalo and call it their own, I don't want to spend my gift card on a... well... sort of "fake" product that's just a marketing trick, if that makes sense! Hope someone can clear things up for me. Thanks in advance! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've recently made the decision to put my whisky collection into storage and slow down my drinking habit.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Assuming I keep the bottles under moderate temperature, and out of sunlight, is there a ballpark figure to how long they'll remain palatable?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;More specifically, I'm interested in real numbers, and not just 'a long time'.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This isn't a question about typical production: I know that Scotch is often peated while Irish rarely is and that Irish is usually triple-distilled whereas Scotch is usually double-distilled. That's covered well by the question &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/5134/whiskey-irish-vs-scottish"&gt;Whiskey - Irish vs. Scottish&lt;/a&gt;. This more of a question about whether those processes make a noticable difference to the result.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Imagine a wine tasting: a skilled wine taster can identify the grape(s) and regions from a sip of the wine without seeing the bottle. I guess my question is: could a consuisseur readily identify whether a whiskey was Scotch or Irish from the flavour alone? Are there typical "giveaway" flavours, smells or textures (other than peat) which identify each?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Or, put it another way, if you wanted to showcase a typical range of whiskey styles, could you do it solely with a selection from North America and Scotland, or are there examples made in Ireland of a style unique to that country?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I enjoy drinking scotch, and I am about to have my first child. I would like to buy a bottle of scotch that has the year my child is born printed on it, and then give them the scotch as a gift when they turn 30 or so. I am well aware that the scotch won't age the same in a bottle as it would in a cask, but the idea is that I will be able to give my child something that I have held for them for 30 years. I am aware that I could find a special one-time release of some sort, but I am looking for a brand of scotch that routinely prints the year it was released somewhere on the bottle because when I have my second child a few years down the road, I would like to do the same thing for them, and I thought it would be nice if they were the same scotch. The closest thing that I can find is Booker's Small Batch Bourbon from Jim Beam. They do a few special releases a year, and the release year is printed on every bottle. If I cannot find a brand of scotch that does something similar I will just go with the Booker's. However, I thought I would ask this question here in case anyone is familiar with the sort of thing I am looking for. It would also be nice if it was a speyside or highland scotch, but that is not really necessary. I thank anyone in advance for taking the time to read this, and hopefully being able to point me in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Best regards,
					Josh&lt;/p&gt;
