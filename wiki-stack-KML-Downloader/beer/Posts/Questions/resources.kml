					&lt;p&gt;When looking for source material to quote, often I find articles from a wide variety of places when it comes to beer. When looking for technology information, I find it best to simply go to the most highly reputable sources (such as a source authored by Mozilla, Google, Microsoft, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Are there any readily available online sources of high repute for beer?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Do you recommend any specific Android app to keep track of the different beers (and of course different kind of beers) that you have tasted?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Someone recommended me Untappd but I may need something less social and more informative...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Beer Advocate used to allow you to give an overall rating for a beer, rather than giving score breakdowns (appearance, smell, mouth feel, etc).  They have recently &lt;a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/community/threads/beeradvocate-returns-to-its-roots-rating-system-revamped.238804/"&gt;changed this&lt;/a&gt; and you can only supply a rating if you rate all the factors.  That makes sense if you're a site owner trying to gather better data, but it's not so great for the casual beer-drinker who just wants to keep track of what she's had and how she liked it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The value of a site like Beer Advocate, rather than just keeping a file on disk, is having access to the descriptions (including categories like "winter warmer" and "amber ale" and suchlike), other items from those breweries (useful when looking at a menu, or shopping), and, out of curiosity, the variance between my rating and the average for people who rated that beer. Also, I want to be able to see and add ratings from multiple locations, so if I just used a file it would have to live in the cloud somewhere.  Alternatively, I'd be happy to use an app on my Android phone.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What's the easiest way for me to track what I've had, with information about the beers (and breweries) and my own ratings?  I don't care if my ratings are shared with the world; I'm happy to contribute them if that's helpful, but I'm looking for a way that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; can track information about &lt;em&gt;my own&lt;/em&gt; tastes.&lt;/p&gt;
