					&lt;p&gt;I've been testing out different Scotches for the last few years and usually find a pretty strong correlation between price point and quality. When I pay more the Scotch almost always offers a better drinking experience up to a point. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That said, recently I bought an &lt;strong&gt;Aberlour 12&lt;/strong&gt; at about 65 cdn and found it to be very similar in character to a &lt;strong&gt;Dalmore 12&lt;/strong&gt; which I bought for a much higher price a few months ago. For that reason I'm characterizing the Aberlour as a high value Scotch. It's priced reasonably and is a bit better of a Scotch than it's price point would suggest.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So I wonder what examples of Scotches people would recommend that are superior than their price point would suggest.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I see Scotch is often labelled as single malt or blended, but never both. What, exactly, is the distinction?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine has come into possession of some rather old alcohol.  On one bottle of J&amp;amp;B Scotch, the label looks like &lt;a href="https://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/j-and-b/j-and-b-rare-blended-scotch-whisky-1950s-whisky/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; from 1958 and not any of their later ones, but my friend's bottle has a screw-top cap, not a cork.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When did J&amp;amp;B start using caps?  (There is no contact information on their web site to ask them directly.)&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've just recently begun drinking Scotch, and I find it absolutely delicious. However, most brands I see in the store are quite expensive. So far the best Scotch I've tried is Aberlour single malt, and although it's not prohibitively expensive, it's not exactly cheap either. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What are some good brands of Scotch that won't break the bank? &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I typically drink brown spirits, however, I have some vodka left over from a wedding party so I was wondering if there are any good vodka cocktail recipes which aren't too sweet (or have too many ingredients) and would be enjoyed by someone who has a pallet for whisky/scotch.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;This isn't a question about typical production: I know that Scotch is often peated while Irish rarely is and that Irish is usually triple-distilled whereas Scotch is usually double-distilled. That's covered well by the question &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/5134/whiskey-irish-vs-scottish"&gt;Whiskey - Irish vs. Scottish&lt;/a&gt;. This more of a question about whether those processes make a noticable difference to the result.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Imagine a wine tasting: a skilled wine taster can identify the grape(s) and regions from a sip of the wine without seeing the bottle. I guess my question is: could a consuisseur readily identify whether a whiskey was Scotch or Irish from the flavour alone? Are there typical "giveaway" flavours, smells or textures (other than peat) which identify each?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Or, put it another way, if you wanted to showcase a typical range of whiskey styles, could you do it solely with a selection from North America and Scotland, or are there examples made in Ireland of a style unique to that country?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It's established in the Scotch world that the age of a whisky pushes it's price up. A MacAllan or Glenmorangie 18 will fetch a much higher price than their respective 12 year old versions.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Having tried a small number of 18 year olds, I've found them highly variable in quality, just as you would with those in the 12 category, but those which were of higher quality seemed to be more &lt;em&gt;mellow and subtle&lt;/em&gt; than their twelve year old counter-parts. But that's only my understanding from a very small sample size.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;So the questions are:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;What does aging a Scotch do to the whisky chemically?&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;What properties do 18 year old Scotches tend to share for tasters?&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Are 18 year old Scotches ever crafted with special care, to make them superior aside from the aging process?&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've noticed the tendency for different regions of Scotland to produce malt whiskies that tend to be similar in character, and I wonder how this came to be.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;That the distilling methods from each region are different is clear enough, but the &lt;strong&gt;question is&lt;/strong&gt; is this because different distilling methods arose naturally out of each region, historically, and became static once they had established themselves, or something else?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of definition we'll call 'rare 18 year old Scotch' bottles that aren't really common in foreign markets like Canada. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What I wonder is, if we're talking about that type of high-grade Scotch, how easy is it to find a bottle if you were visiting distilleries or liquor stores in Scotland directly.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In other words, when distilleries produce premium product does it tend to mostly stay in country, or are some of these whiskies just produced in such low quantities that getting your hands on it anywhere is rare?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I'm curious to experience Christopher Hitchens reported favourite drink. He described it as Johnnie Walker black, cut with perrier water, and no ice.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I've had a go and it's interesting, but I'm wondering what else needs to be done to get the perfect drink:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;What temperature should the whisky be?&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;What temperature should the perrier water be?&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;What would be the ideal ratio of whisky to water?&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I enjoy drinking scotch, and I am about to have my first child. I would like to buy a bottle of scotch that has the year my child is born printed on it, and then give them the scotch as a gift when they turn 30 or so. I am well aware that the scotch won't age the same in a bottle as it would in a cask, but the idea is that I will be able to give my child something that I have held for them for 30 years. I am aware that I could find a special one-time release of some sort, but I am looking for a brand of scotch that routinely prints the year it was released somewhere on the bottle because when I have my second child a few years down the road, I would like to do the same thing for them, and I thought it would be nice if they were the same scotch. The closest thing that I can find is Booker's Small Batch Bourbon from Jim Beam. They do a few special releases a year, and the release year is printed on every bottle. If I cannot find a brand of scotch that does something similar I will just go with the Booker's. However, I thought I would ask this question here in case anyone is familiar with the sort of thing I am looking for. It would also be nice if it was a speyside or highland scotch, but that is not really necessary. I thank anyone in advance for taking the time to read this, and hopefully being able to point me in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Best regards,
					Josh&lt;/p&gt;
