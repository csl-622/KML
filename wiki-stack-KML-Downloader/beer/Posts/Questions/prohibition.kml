					&lt;p&gt;Historically, is there any case in which prohibition of alcohol has actually dissuaded its consumption?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;It failed miserably in the United States, for example...&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Other than the USA, do any other countries have dry counties?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;I understand that the term county may not exist in some counties, so one can adopt a different term that may be better suited for a particular countries.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What is a dry county?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;blockquote&gt;
					  &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_county" rel="noreferrer"&gt;dry county&lt;/a&gt; is a county in the United States whose government forbids the sale of any kind of alcoholic beverages. Some prohibit off-premises sale, some prohibit on-premises sale, and some prohibit both. Hundreds of dry counties exist across the United States, a majority of them in the South. A number of smaller jurisdictions also exist, such as cities, towns, and townships, which prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages. These are known as dry cities, dry towns, or dry townships.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;
