					all alcohol is expensive in the UK for tax reasons. What do you mean by "cheapest"? How much are you willing to skimp on quality?also would you describe Â£15 per litre as cheap?

					I really think @MonicaCellio's comment about sanitisation should be first and foremost in the answer. They are asking "Can **any** mistake in the brewing process...". The one difference I found between mead brewing and other brewing is you don't boil the mix so contamination is slightly more likely. Even with bad sanitisation from what I can tell making something toxic is unlikely because the alcohol kills most things, you will just create something undrinkable. I've heard mead has a bad reputation, but I'm not sure why.
