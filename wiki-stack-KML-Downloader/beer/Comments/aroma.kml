					I feel like this is probably too broad, there are no less than a dozen different types of beer glasses and each of them is intended for a different type of beer. Questions should be more specific.

					I don't think there has really been a scientific study on the beer glass shapes etc.  HOwever there have beeen some on wine http://www.aromadictionary.com/articles/wineglass_article.html  

					Which basically said the shape of a glass can affect the aroma but many shapes can have the same impact.  The major factor in aroma enhancement was the ratio of glass cup diameter to the diamter of it's opening.

					Check out the last study on the linked page for more info.

					Could you perhaps explain why it makes sense to consume more calories in cold weather than warm weather? It might _seem_ intuitive, but upon deeper thought I'm not sure why that should be true. For example, it's known that a cold body temperature leads to decreased basal metabolism—meaning less calories burned. Some say we're programmed to "stockpile" when the weather gets colder, but there are no studies that evidence this view; others say we become accustomed to higher caloric intake during winter due to the habit of celebrating holidays annually—but again, no studies.

					It sounds like you'd release a lot of carbonation (and expose a lot more surface area to oxidation) by pouring the beer into separate glasses. I think that would affect the taste even in a few minutes...

					A glass shouldn't break in the freezer, the expanding ice has room to move. In a bottle it has nowhere to go, so it cracks.
