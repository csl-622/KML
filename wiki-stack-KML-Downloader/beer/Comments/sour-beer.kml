					Are you looking for the reason behind the sour flavor or an explanation of the process that makes sour beer?

					This is called a "Blacksmith" in a lot of bars in the US (well, the handful of bars that carry anything other than Guinness and Bass). "Black and Tan" would be Guinness/Bass, "Half and Half" is Guinness/Harp. There are other cutsie names based on the beer + Guinness pairing. AFAICT Guinness can layer on any CO2 beer. Not tried to layer it with another nitro beer like Boddingtons, but maybe with a careful pour? A bunch of Guinness combos are listed here http://www.theperfectlyhappyman.com/various-guinness-combinations/

					I now think the temperature had something to do with it but seeing as I was drinking in very strong sun (it was a hot day) I'm now thinking as you suggested that the UV light had something to do with it.

					Sorry to say, how clean the establishment keeps the keg lines could impact this, as well.
