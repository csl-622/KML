					Can you provide a reference to wine corks being made out of Nomex? I am not seeing anything about that.

					I hate plastic corks. Wineries are lazy in using them. They should be using screwcaps instead, which are recyclable. Plastic corks are hard to insert into a bottle and hard to remove. They have made some progress with plastic corks, but they still suck. Having said that, I think the claim that 10% of wines are tainted with TCA is way too high. In my own winery, I thought it was around 2% but then we used high end corks.

					The interior of the cork is sponge like (hard sponge) the outer shell is hard(ish) plastic like... does this help, apologies for photo.  The cork states NOMACORC

					Yes, but they are way more expensive and it gets hotter in the Alsace than on the Rhine river (well technically both are on the Rhine) mostly giving a more full bodied Riesling than the German ones. These are generalities as I'm sure you can find some German ones that match the Alsatian ones in warmer years.

					There are good dry rieslings from many places. I've had some nice ones from Washington. What bothers me is the curt dismissal of German rieslings. Also off dry and sweet wines have there place and aren't "wimpy".

					I lived on the Rhine river for 3 years so I know my German Rieslings quite well, thank you very much, but IMNSHO I think you need more power than what German rieslings can give you. The Alsace is warmer and drier than most of the Riesling growing territory in Germany. Grand Cru Alsatian Rieslings especially give you more "stuff".

					I'm not questioning your suggesting of an Alsatian Riesling at all. It is excellent. But some wine beginners would read your answer and surmise that all German rieslings are wimpy and sweet. That is simply not accurate.

					NOMACORC is one of the standard plastic corks out in the market. They have several different products from plonk wine to high end corks that transmit minute amounts of oxygen to slowly age the wine and much easier to pull out of the bottle. The quotes below about plastic corks look like talking points from the natural cork industry. Having said that, I just think plastic corks are a waste. Go to screw caps if are you are going to bottle wine on the cheap

					@Steve S  Thanks for that, I eventually tracked it down to exactly what you have also said.  I found it quite interesting about allowing minute amounts of oxygen in.  The wine was very expensive, but to be honest should have had a screw cap!
