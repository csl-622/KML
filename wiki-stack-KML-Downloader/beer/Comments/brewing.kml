					First off, a Pilsner is a lager. And that's why I was trying to be careful with my wording, and say things like "on average", since you're absolutely right, they can often be just as light or as dark. But I would argue that your typical lager is lighter (specifically flavour-wise) than your typical ale, and I've never had a lager that is as heavy as something like an imperial stout.

					These distinctions are definitely based more on ingredients than brewing process. Wheat beers have a lot of wheat, IPAs have a lot of hops (relative to other styles), stouts have roasted barley, etc. Alexander Keiths IPA is an ENGLISH IPA. English IPAs are very different from American IPAs and are not hoppy at all relative to American IPAs. They are however, supposed to be more bitter (hoppy) than English Pale Ales. American IPAs are a totally different style, and judging English IPAs on that standard is like judging a Scottish Heavy to be bad if it doesn't taste like a lager.

					Fair enough, @paul. I was just using Alexander Keiths as an example of what I consider a very "mainstream" IPA, not tasting much hoppier to me than a Pilsner. I don't think it's bad because it's an English IPA, I'm just not a big fan of that particular beer. As to brewing process versus ingredients, you're right, a lot of it is ingredients more than process. But lagers versus ales is definitely a brewing process decision, which is why I started out with that.

					@paul One could argue that barley is the ingredient (including what type, where it was grown, etc.), and roasting the barley is part of the brewing process (including how exactly it was roasted, duration, etc.).

					Just for the record, my answer (as one who has been homebrewing for almost 2 decades) is the best practice is not to.  Sterilize your bottles and equipment.  Once you start pasteurizing, you are going to have lots of extra stuff you have to do and there are risks of having all kinds of additional things going wrong.

					I think this question is too broad as written, but if you focus it on major competitions you'd encounter as a consumer (not as a prospective entrant), that would be a valuable question.  Maybe you could ask about entering craft-brewing competitions separately.  (Be sure to explain what you seek to get out of the experience; don't just ask for a list.)

					I think a moderator has to do it, since Homebrewing did not appear as a potential target site when I flagged this for moving. See [here](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/85017/moving-my-own-question-to-another-stackexchange-site). That said, I think it's fine if you just copy the question and post it as a new question on Homebrewing. You'll want to make sure your question hasn't already been answered on that site, but I did a quick check and didn't find anything.

					I know that small cartridges with CO2 exist but does not using of pure CO2 make the beer too fizzy? Maybe the beer becomes too fizzy only after some time (several days)? --- Are there similar cartridges with N2+CO2 mixture? In Czech Republic I have found only small CO2 cartridges and the smallest containers with a mixture like [Biogon NC 20](http://www.linde-gas.ru/en/applications/gases_for_food_industry/biogon_gas_mixtures/index.html) from Linde are 20 litre [gas cylinders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_cylinder).

					The CO2 only makes the beer too fizzy if you use too much. Apart from stouts/IRAs that use beer gas (n2/co2 mix), almost all beers are carbonated with only CO2. Given you only need enough pressure to push the beer out of the keg rather than carbonate, you will never use so much to make the beer too fizzy.

					Obviously, it's why they drank beer in the Middle Ages rather than water, the alcohol kills much of it. It's more the principle of the matter for me; people have been drinking unpasteurized milk for ages, just like beer. I don't recall any mass milk-infection epidemic, nor a beer-infection epidemic. Give people the choice. But again, another discussion for another time.

					I think this should be on homebrew.SE - there are many similar questions there about using wine yeast or bakers' yeast to brew beer. If you want to know specifically how much of a beer's flavor/aroma profile comes from the yeast, then rephrasing the question to that affect will remove the emphasis on homebrewing.

					@WayneInYak - LessPop_MoreFizz's response could have been nicer, but to be fair, your answer in its original form was a link-only answer, with some pasted material; we prefer posts that answer questions without visitors having to leave the site. Also, the mentioned link leads to an unreasonably large amount of material; a link to a page with 78 sections of law (and apparently no way to load them on a single page to search) isn't very helpful. If you've found specific citations, please let us know exactly where. I for one can't find where it says one must purchase the growler from the brewery.

					Het Kanon was originally introduced in larger (0.45 liter) bottles, which combined with its light and sweet taste to knock out experienced beer drinkers. I've got a friend who can put away staggering amounts of alcohol, but when he drinks Het Kanon, weird stuff happens to him. It's the only beer in which I can outdrink anyone. And I like the taste. Dangerous stuff.

					Try "Gulden Draak", (Golden Dragon). 10.5%, they sometimes brew a special occasions batch (in 0.5 liter bottles) that is 11.5%. There are some more Belgian beers in the 10-12% range. I'm pretty certain a saw a 14% beer once, but I can't recall what it was.

					As long as it's still called a "Beer" it's a legit answer I guess. It just has to be labeled as a freeze-distilled beer and not as a brewed one if it isn't. But there are just as many different answers right now as when I googled for the strongest beer...  ^^

					The original was ratified, in Bayern at least, in 1516. As I understand it, it was to prevent the monastaries from adding potentionally harmful ingredients. Besides, the current [Biersteuer](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bierstg_2009/__2.html) is only a fraction of the [Branntweinsteuer](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/branntwmong/__131.html). Using other additives wouldn't skirt taxes, it would increase them.

					@iamnotmaynard: That could be according to a US legal classification. Other English speaking countries don't even use the term "liquor". This brings up the question of since countries have varying different legal definitions of beer (In Japan this gives us oddities such as "happoushu"), is there a natural definition of beer, or do we need to come up with our own definition for the purposes of the site?

					@Robert: You would have to show that mashing a mouse cannot result in any particles of size sufficiently small to pass through said filters. So while you might not get a mouse tail in your glass this filter doesn't necessarily rule out all potential effects of mashed mouse body tissues and fluids on final beer flavour.

					I made a little more research and came with an interesting result.

					There is higher excise duty in the Czech republic than it is for example in Germany or France while beer is more expensive in both countries.

					What does it say is that of the three mentioned reasons there is one more - historical market prizes of beer. Beer market in the Czech republic is wide. Consumers want low prizes, more producers are willing to fight with lower prizes and therefore the prize on the market stays low (beer is not really a money maker in most Czech pubs)

					Such opulence [of ingredients], due to the use of meat sauce, cheese and hard-boiled eggs [it is lasagna "campana"], all dressed in sheets of pasta, goes well with a well structured craft beer, but with sharp "weapons" to de-grease the palate.
					I would then suggest an amber ale, or a darker amber: caramel malts, rightly toasted - excessive roasting may in fact have to battle with ingredients such as tomatoes - that will give sensations and structure that hold the richness of the meat and the sauce. But not enough.

					Our beer, we said, must also have the ability to " clean up" the palate, perhaps with a touch of citrus fruit or herbal, with a pleasant feeling of hops. Still, will absolutely not to be cloying [too sweet]. So we better prefer a product from the dry bitter and strong with good carbonation, since bubbles help the drinkability.

					As for the alcohol, it would be preferable not to exceed, remaining between 6 and 7 degrees.

					That article seems to be about building a diet around drinking beer every day.  Idea seems to be that for 1 week a month you drink no more than 1 liter of beer every day, 2 liters of water, and eat very few calories (~800) focusing mostly on meat and veg and don't have too much salt.  Which is pretty much a regular diet, just with a codified beer allowance.  Including beer as part of calorie counting is definitely valid, but this seems like an odd approach.

					This might sound kind of crass; but, all alcoholic beer has to be fermented. Not sure if your comment was complete thought (ie. tripples are supposed to be bottle conditioned). The other problem we might be having is interchanging words. Some aren't an issue (porter and stout, even though they were originally different styles they are more or less synonymous now)... The difference between "bottle conditioned" and "fermented in a bottle" is HUGE, though.

					Unless someone can correct me... You never *ferment* in the bottle. The bottle would explode from the violent reaction that is fermentation. After your primary fermentation, you can choose to rack the beer into a secondary fermentor that will help your beer clear or bottle the beer with a little added priming sugar. The former allows the beer to clarify more while the latter will more than likely yield a yeast cake in the bottom of your bottle.

					But why brew somewhere hot that you have to cool instead of importing? Refrigeration in the home wasn't particularly common when the brewery started either, making it hard to have a cold beer. (Coffee was - and still is - served with condensed or evaporated milk which keeps better). Tiger today also brews ABC and Guinness amongst others.

					Thanks, although I do not know if these have been bottle conditioned they have high abv, I do have some bcbs bottles from 2013 and indeed they had tasted better with age. They have been around that temperature, although I can't say exactly, but at least I know they're safe to drink.

					I think the actual distinctions here are much more complicated, and a lot of it is probably tradition rather than technical definition.  For example:  There is rice wine that is not sake.  Sake is made from converted grain starches, like beer, but is usually considered to be wine like.  Wine is made from pressed grapes but is not cider.  There is no grape cider.  Dandelion wine is made from flowers, with straight sugar added.  Ginger root has the hell grated out of and steeped in water, usually with straight sugar.  By process, I don't know what you can classify that as.

					Interesting the Rochefort 10 is second to Westvleteren. I remember after trying the Westvleteren for the first time, telling my brother that the Rochefort 10 would give him a good idea of what the Westvlet is like, since WV is so hard to find. Although, I've rarely seen Rochefort 10 in Ontario either.

					Nice to add some historical perspective to this.  Nitro is definitely a new method that attempts to make keg poured or bottled beer more like cask pulled beer, which I'm surprised wasn't in this question already.  Though your answer is a bit of a ramble-y wall of text, if you've got the time it would look amazing with some formatting.

					I'm sorry, but this is all wrong. Brewers were well aware of yeast centuries before Pasteur. A Norwegian yeast log, an implement used to preserve the yeast between brewings, has the year 1638 carved into it. In Sweden, Olaus Magnus's recipe from 1555 mentions yeast, etc. There are even hints that brewers knew about yeast in Roman times. Very likely ancient beers were not spontaneously fermented, for a whole number of reasons.

					A lot of styles, especially geographically named styles draw their defining character from what's available where and when they're brewed.  Pilsners are defined by the use of Czech hops and soft water, which is what's available in Pilzen where the style originated.  Another one is Oktoberfest beer, which is sometimes called Marzen.  Brewing between April &amp; September was against the law (summer heat/bacteria would make bad beer), so they brewed strong, hoppy beer in March and kept it cellared until lighter beers ran out, cracked it in late summer, and finished it off at Oktoberfest.

					Let us not forget that @FlorianNeiss has to deal with Reinheitsgebot (the law in Germany that only allows water, hops, barley, and yeast into a beer). I could see why it would be much less appealing (though still a ton of variety) if those were my only options. In America we can put anything we're willing to try into beer. User John Felts gives the best simplified answer to your question.

					@Grohlier the sad sad thin is. That thanks to the amazing EU. Nowadays you can buy czech beer or even budwiser in the german supermarket. Or any store that sells beer. Bevor the stupid EU low. You could only buy German beer with the german Reinheitsgebot. On the other hand you can mix shit like grapefruit in your beer and sell in germany like the company "Schäferhofer" but then you are not allowed to call it beer. But you can call it beer mix. :/

					This is called a "Blacksmith" in a lot of bars in the US (well, the handful of bars that carry anything other than Guinness and Bass). "Black and Tan" would be Guinness/Bass, "Half and Half" is Guinness/Harp. There are other cutsie names based on the beer + Guinness pairing. AFAICT Guinness can layer on any CO2 beer. Not tried to layer it with another nitro beer like Boddingtons, but maybe with a careful pour? A bunch of Guinness combos are listed here http://www.theperfectlyhappyman.com/various-guinness-combinations/

					I would start with a clear, strong (68 % alc./vol.) Absinthe to begin with.   "Absinthe that is bright green may be artificially colored. However, not all quality absinthe has a green color. Quality absinthe may also be clear, orange, or red, but the color should be imparted by natural herbal ingredients such as petite wormwood."

					But absinthe is traditionally made with wormwood. If you want to make wormwood-based absinthe, it must be green for chemical reasons (as the herb itself gives the beverage the color). Though clarifying, I'm asking about _how_ can green absinthe be colored other way.

					Nice for adding the picture. As I suspected, these are Czech-style but, this is a great example because these are in fact... Spanish. Just goes to show that Czech-style doesn't necessarily mean from the Czech Republic. Also notice that three of them are well over 70% ABV. On a personal note, nice observation about the primary colors and theories as to solutions. I wouldn't have noticed. If you don't made my saying, I think you'd make a fine chemist.

(the only sentence that contains the string 'carb' is this: "high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods can make your body absorb alcohol more slowly."). Frankly, this idea seems like rank superstition.

					A Brit doc on Colditz mentioned making [hootch from turnips](https://www.nysun.com/obituaries/george-drew-87-british-pow-brewed-turnip-hooch/23502/). Even better is when tunnelers ended up in the [castle's wine cellar](https://pilcrow.squarespace.com/stories/colditz), by mistake, and drank 137 bottles, the German colonel's supply.

					Well, if we're mentioning idiotic "novelty drinks" [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2LzA2A6J74o) here martini goes for 100K. Or, dump a gold bar in your * *insert beverage* * and you now have the most expensive drink in the world.

					I'm afraid this is false. The vikings had words for yeast (kveykur) and there's even a passage in the saga that talks about a brewer adding yeast to the beer, but it wouldn't ferment (probably stored too long) "so that all their work was in vain". They definitely knew about yeast.

					Another great place to understand different styles is https://www.bjcp.org/docs/2015_Guidelines_Beer.pdf and you should be asking these beer questions on the homebrew stack exchange because those guys are the real beer geeks.
