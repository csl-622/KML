					Yesterday I drank a Belgian beer with sediment. The day before yesterday I drank a cloudy Belgian beer. Gosh, they were good!

					Not been around for a while (months), but really, give me a break - my first reaction (as a woman) would be to run away, but then I would stand back and laugh.  Also if my husband gave me a bottle of sweet beer I would either have to kill him or divorce him - which ever is the simplest!  Haven't women got over this 'girl power' thing yet, I feel embarrassed to be female.

					@dougal4.0.0 : I can't say you're wrong or even disagree, I just tried and give OP what could possibly be the tactical aspect of such a choice from a store. Unfortunately, many shops still think they can target women using the same old "nasty"(?) tricks... I believe its completely *wrong* ( just to remain polite) but it doesn't mean one shouldn't take that into account, don't you think?
