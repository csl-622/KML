					I'm pretty sure your description of a Tripel vs a standard Trappist beer is incorrect.  Currently, dubbel vs tripel is just a marketing difference.  There's a stylistic difference (much like the difference between a stout and a porter), but as far as I can tell there's no fixed definition of how you brew one vs the other.  See http://ithinkaboutbeer.com/2013/03/19/q-ale-why-are-they-called-dubbel-tripel-quad-etc/ for more.

					You need to be careful quoting prices - the internet is worldwide. I live in Norway and I'm pretty sure it's a lot more than that for a bottle if it's available at all. And most seasoned beer drinkers would readily drink a dubbel without a hangover. I've been to a number of festivals in Belgium serving dubbels and trippels with no hangover if you manage the beer and your water consumption in proportion. And -1 - trippels are very different from dubbles. It's not just about magnification.

					I usually drink dubbels in a wide glass - like a challace/goblet. IMHO, you don't need a tall glass - the carbonation or aroma isn't a key player here, but more the richness of the malt.

					True, it may be different in Norway. Then again, I didn't realize there was much of a demand for American beers in Europe. with that said, here in the states, It's $12. But that's not relevant to the question regardless; no reason to vote down my answer for that.

					@Fishtoaster, I've got no clue what you're talking about. It's very clear what the differences are; just look at the ABV. There's no way you can compare the differences between a dubbel and a tripel to that of a porter and a stout.

					This is actually, wrong, a trappist can also be a Tripel. Like Westmalle Tripel. Not all tripels are Trappists. Trappist is a label for beers being brewed within the walls of a Trappist Abbey.

					I have done this twice and I would like to add my thoughts: The most difficult part is the phone part to make the appointment. I tried it twice. The first time I called for a whole day (about 150 calls) before I finally have them. The seconde time my girlfriend and I called for a day and a half (about 250 calls) to have an answer. I suggest that you prepare yourself for that :)

					Also, you can't chose which beer you will have, it depends on the week as Valentin Grégoire said : http://www.sintsixtus.be/bierverkoopactueel.htm You should try to have the 8 or the 12, the blond is more "classic" When you are there, try the In De Vrede Inn near the monastery, you may be able to buy some more. And I advise you to try their Westvleteren Paté wich is quite awesome :)

					Well technically it is against California law for a brewery to fill growlers with other brewery's name/logo on it. There is a way around this though by covering it up (I have used tape). In San Diego, any place has happily filled or even supplied the tape. I will have to try those places you mentioned though, maybe I'll have some luck.

					Actually, mix of nitrogen and CO2 is pretty common. Like, 70% of nitrogen. the point is, you don't want to change amount of dissolved carbon dioxide in any way, so mixtures are generally "safer" at serving pressure. For hi-carbonation beer, it will allow beer to lessen it's co2 content, but slowly. On low carbonated one, it will add co2 to it, but again - slow enough for it not to really matter.

					@JasonCoder, I heard of people that like infected beers. Why would you want an infected beer when you can have a good, crisp, clean Budweizer? ;D

					Bottles aren't as likely to pop a cap as they are for the glass to break, at least in my experience.  The bottle cap is crimped over the lip of the bottle and makes a very good mechanical connection.  When people over carbonate their home-brew they end up with bottle grenades because the glass fails before the cap pops off, which is the opposite to what happens if you over carbonate something in a corked wine bottle (unless the cork is secured with a cage).  Perhaps it may be different with screw-top caps.

					Beer does not have to be "100% brewed by Jewish hands"; it just needs to be under supervision, which might not be constant.  Wine has special rules that don't apply to most other foods and drinks, because wine is sometimes used by other religions and the prohibitions about being involved with idolatry are very strong.  If you want to know more about that, I recommend visiting [Mi Yodeya](http://judaism.stackexchange.com).

					This is my experience as well. I like the first answer, although I think it's important to note the 'modern' distinction too, and I think this is it. Most porters I come across have a nice body, and are often sweetened or spiced.

					I'd dispute the "all you need is water... and you have a normal alcoholic drink". That was the marketing hype, but considering it's 55% ethanol and ~45% cyclodextrin, and all the flavors are necessarily going to be essences, I wouldn't call the end result "normal" in any way.

					Ethanol is not corrosive. Glass is certainly not a liquid at room temperature, and neither are the plastics we're discussing. BPA might be a problem, but if it is, it isn't because plastic is a liquid. Ethanol does increase BPA solubility in water at relatively low concentrations (~10%) per https://www.researchgate.net/post/I_have_a_problem_with_dissolving_of_Bis-Phenol_A_BPA_in_water_Any_suggestions
