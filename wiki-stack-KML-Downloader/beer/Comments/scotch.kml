					The cost is related to effort, rarity, supply and demand. And the quality is almost entirely opinion based - there are some cheap 8yr old whiskies I prefer to some 20yr olds, but other folks disagree. Flagged for closure as opinion based

					@Laura If you go out and have a pre-dinner drink and then switch to beer or wine later in the evening you probably have not drank much.   It is not evidence CO2 does not cause alcohol hit the head faster.

					Unfortunately, as well as being opinion based, this question may also be slightly hard to answer _in terms of pricing_ due to regional distribution costs. Often I feel I pay a premium for Scotch simply due to lack of availability. This might skew any possible correlation between cost and quality.

					Fridge could be right below the counter, no need to go anywhere. Liquors on the display are the same as in the fridge, but room temperature for those who don't want it cold. Fridges with doors that open from above don't lose energy as fast as the common household ones. One fridge per bartender would probably suffice.

					I haven't been able to find much evidence or research that details how distillation methods developed in the regions.  I did find this Edinburgh University http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/jhb/whisky/lapointe/text.html which quotes Jackson about how the local environment impacts whisky:

					&gt; The relationship with geographic features was demonstrated, supporting the hypothesis that whiskies are affected not only by distillery secrets and traditions but also by factors dependent on region such as water, soil, microclimate, temperature and even air quality

					It's incredibly easy to shop old Whiskey from Scotland and Ireland. I never had a problem finding old bottles in a well sorted store here in Germany; and if they don't happen to have them, you can always order online on amazon or at a whiskey reseller. If you need some links, I can give them to you.

					So everybody is different. I have had 1 to 1.5 bottles of organic red wine per night and never had a hangover, not true for me with not organic wine and same quantity. Personal experience is different for everybody. True on the labeling, some wineries can not afford to get certified but still grow and produce organic wine. A good wine store knows these things and can point you in the right direction, which is true for Europe and the States.

					People swear absolutely that this is true for wine, whisky, whatever their beverage of choice. Time and time again when it's actually tested blind, price has no correlation whatsoever with user preference once the rotgut at the very low end is removed. This is true for everyone except those who are professionally trained to an extremely high level (e.g. master sommeliers), presumably since it is impossible to effectively blind them in a test.

					I don't think you can equivocate wine and whisky here. Wine is a completely different animal. Where Scotch throws people off, I think, is that a very good 12 can be much better than a bad 18, and a lower price. The reason for this is that most people are very bad judges of good whisky, but it doesn't mean there is no correlation between price/quality. When comparing Scotches, though, you probably need to compare *within* age categories to control for price.

					Jon - the problem with "good" is that it is entirely subjective. Some people love a Macallan. Others cannot even taste it. Some love a Laphraoig, but others cannot stand the surgical taste. Similarly for peat or smoke. Whisky is entirely an opinion industry - just try ones in your price range.

					I disagree, you need to normalize by age statements. A very good 12 is usually better than a more expensive, but mediocre 18. But a very good 12 will usually be more expensive than a mediocre 12.

					And sometimes whiskies are branded with the chivas regal effect, which distorts things a bit.
