					@LessPop_MoreFizz I'm not aware of any legal designation or requirement, by those standards I'm sure it is all still seen as beer and I think what you said is right, adherence to the Reinheitsebot is purely a point of pride, but I do believe that is why they label their Blue label as they do (I'm citing the employee that gave the tour) I've edited my post to reflect that this is controversial and not in any way enforced.

					I think a moderator has to do it, since Homebrewing did not appear as a potential target site when I flagged this for moving. See [here](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/85017/moving-my-own-question-to-another-stackexchange-site). That said, I think it's fine if you just copy the question and post it as a new question on Homebrewing. You'll want to make sure your question hasn't already been answered on that site, but I did a quick check and didn't find anything.

					I know that small cartridges with CO2 exist but does not using of pure CO2 make the beer too fizzy? Maybe the beer becomes too fizzy only after some time (several days)? --- Are there similar cartridges with N2+CO2 mixture? In Czech Republic I have found only small CO2 cartridges and the smallest containers with a mixture like [Biogon NC 20](http://www.linde-gas.ru/en/applications/gases_for_food_industry/biogon_gas_mixtures/index.html) from Linde are 20 litre [gas cylinders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_cylinder).

					The CO2 only makes the beer too fizzy if you use too much. Apart from stouts/IRAs that use beer gas (n2/co2 mix), almost all beers are carbonated with only CO2. Given you only need enough pressure to push the beer out of the keg rather than carbonate, you will never use so much to make the beer too fizzy.

					In addition to honest pints sold as 16oz in a 20oz glass, you'll frequently find beer sold as a "pint" that's actually more like 12oz served in a 14 or 16oz glass, often known as a "cheater pint".  See http://honestpintproject.info

					To follow on Sloloem's comment about cooling the tap tower, a quick and relatively painless method is the one illustrated in [this Popular Mechanics article](http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/improvement/interior/fighting-foam-how-to-insulate-a-kegerator-draft-tower-16554310). It has worked very well for me and only took about 15 minutes of actual work.

					There is evidence of lagers as early as the 15th century. They were brewed periodically for a few hundred years- as Pepi stated below, they went from being made occasionally to being the most common style contemporaneously with the rise of refrigeration.

					I don’t know where you live, but what you claim was not the case in Germany for a long time. There were very few non-alcoholic pilsner’s until a couple of years ago (Clausthaler was the only big brand), but there was malt beer and different non-alcoholic wheat beers (Erdinger, Franziskaner...).
					Nowadays, most big brands offer non-alcoholic variants of their beers, and since in Germany pilsner is the most common type of beer, there’s a large variety of non-alcoholic pilsners to be found in supermarkets.
