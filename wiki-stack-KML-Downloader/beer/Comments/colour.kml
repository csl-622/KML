					@wogsland If only it were that straightforward... the paper had nothing to do with beer, but was just using it as a helpful example of a completely different concept. But, fwiw, http://beeronomics.org.

					Lived in Scotland all my life and I've never seen a thistle glass.   In the UK pubs sell beer in generic pint glasses unless the beer supplier has provided glassware.  Regardless of that any glass used for draught beer has to contain 1/3, 1/2 or 1 pint.

					this makes a lot of sense, as each brewery/beer would like to showcase its beer in the best possible glass for the beer itself. Which is why I have seen the subtle differences in glassware for similar beer types.

					@user23614 in northern american continent you will most always find beer poured into either a traditional mug or a stange glass. Unless the place has a beer cup for a specific beer that is, which they almost always do for the traditional cheap beer (one of many examples: Stella Artois)

					This is all assuming, that the draught system is clean and running at 100%, and the people pouring it know what they're doing. There are many poorly-managed beer bars around my area where I order from the bottle because the draught quality is so suspect. 

					Both bottles and kegs should have CO2 or neutral gas in them, not air, so it should be a non-issue as to the volume. Granted, the closures on kegs are typically tighter than the cap on a bottle.

					Did that site actually cite the study? I didn't see it if they did.

					I would start with a clear, strong (68 % alc./vol.) Absinthe to begin with.   "Absinthe that is bright green may be artificially colored. However, not all quality absinthe has a green color. Quality absinthe may also be clear, orange, or red, but the color should be imparted by natural herbal ingredients such as petite wormwood."

					I just realized "kinds of hops...kinds of flavors" seem like a hop-link and hop-flavor link. They are, in fact, the same concept... One is a wheel and the other is an Excel-style list.

					But absinthe is traditionally made with wormwood. If you want to make wormwood-based absinthe, it must be green for chemical reasons (as the herb itself gives the beverage the color). Though clarifying, I'm asking about _how_ can green absinthe be colored other way.

					Nice for adding the picture. As I suspected, these are Czech-style but, this is a great example because these are in fact... Spanish. Just goes to show that Czech-style doesn't necessarily mean from the Czech Republic. Also notice that three of them are well over 70% ABV. On a personal note, nice observation about the primary colors and theories as to solutions. I wouldn't have noticed. If you don't made my saying, I think you'd make a fine chemist.

					I got really surprised too when I saw they were Spanish. I thought they were French (which I guess is what the distiller expects the customers to think at first sight...).
