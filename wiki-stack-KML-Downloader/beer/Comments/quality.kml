					I think it matters what kind of wine. For me, champagne gets better up to about $60. In any case if $20 wine tastes great to you enjoy your frugality.

					If nobody answers this, I'll flesh this out as an answer tomorrow... But essentially once you eliminate the rotgut at the bottom end, price and "quality" (in the sense we would normally understand it) are pretty much uncorrelated, as long as you are tasting blind (and haven't been primed psychologically). There are lots of relevant studies in the literature.

					I get the tulip glass thing, but as a big whisky drinker I don't like them, too hard to drink from. I usually use a small, wide-rimmed glass somewhere between a shot glass and a tumbler, enough to hold an ounce or two of neat liquor, and lightweight. Also don't usually dilute my whisky, given I should experiment a bit more with that.

					@mcraen I'm a pretty strong proponent of enjoying what you enjoy in whatever way gives you the maximum pleasure, so if partaking of larger sips of cask strength from a wider-mouth glass is what does it for you, you should by all means keep doing that! I tried to hedge a little ("if you are drinking it to taste it" preface to my exhortation not to skip step 5) and suggestion that you should really be experimenting... it should be both fun and a learning experience, and hopefully deliciously pleasurable too :)

					I've done a small bit of researching on whisky dilution and am still unconvinced that it 'improves' the experience, but rather just 'changes' the experience. I'd love to get a definitive answer on the effect. I suspect the practice has arisen from people who drink sub-par whisky and like masking the harshness a bit, with water and/or ice. For me, I have no problem with the harshness of any liquor so usually just go full strength.

					That pretty much matches my experience. Although the best wines I've tried are in the £30-£35 range it's also clear that there are plenty of wines at this price and more which have trouble standing up to some sub-£10 ones.

					Yep. I suspected that the process is difficult and hard to do objectively. Although there's got to be some, any process at all that wine experts use to decide on a wine based on quality. When I go into a wine shop I feel totally blind and would like to change that, to any degree. If it's not really doable at all, I'd like to know that too!

					The question you set appealled for a closed answer, I don't know how to make a useful one ;) I don't mean you are wrong in your assumption, but a diminutive threshold can be found in nearly every product or service, notwithstandig Vleben Good. Price can tend to mathematical infinity, while product or service can only tend to the maximum human abilities (for wine, sensoral capacity and knowledge which are limited by genetics and lifespan) : the diminutive threshold is the widening gap between both and won't widen the same for two given people. Focusing in value is IMHO more relevant than price.

					I hate plastic corks. Wineries are lazy in using them. They should be using screwcaps instead, which are recyclable. Plastic corks are hard to insert into a bottle and hard to remove. They have made some progress with plastic corks, but they still suck. Having said that, I think the claim that 10% of wines are tainted with TCA is way too high. In my own winery, I thought it was around 2% but then we used high end corks.

					Yes, but they are way more expensive and it gets hotter in the Alsace than on the Rhine river (well technically both are on the Rhine) mostly giving a more full bodied Riesling than the German ones. These are generalities as I'm sure you can find some German ones that match the Alsatian ones in warmer years.

					I lived on the Rhine river for 3 years so I know my German Rieslings quite well, thank you very much, but IMNSHO I think you need more power than what German rieslings can give you. The Alsace is warmer and drier than most of the Riesling growing territory in Germany. Grand Cru Alsatian Rieslings especially give you more "stuff".

					I'm not questioning your suggesting of an Alsatian Riesling at all. It is excellent. But some wine beginners would read your answer and surmise that all German rieslings are wimpy and sweet. That is simply not accurate.

					NOMACORC is one of the standard plastic corks out in the market. They have several different products from plonk wine to high end corks that transmit minute amounts of oxygen to slowly age the wine and much easier to pull out of the bottle. The quotes below about plastic corks look like talking points from the natural cork industry. Having said that, I just think plastic corks are a waste. Go to screw caps if are you are going to bottle wine on the cheap

					@Steve S  Thanks for that, I eventually tracked it down to exactly what you have also said.  I found it quite interesting about allowing minute amounts of oxygen in.  The wine was very expensive, but to be honest should have had a screw cap!
