					I'd say experimenting with a bottle is the surest way to know. I've read that regardless of color, bottles are now coated with a UV-reflective layer on the inside to help protect against skunking. But obviously, seeing as how beers continue to skunk, they're not perfect. Leave a beer in the cupboard for several days and see what happens (and let us know).

					I think you are trying to say that a short mash promotes higher body, and that is incorrect. The mash temperature does affect fermentability -- higher temperatures (156F-162F) causes the enzymes to produce more dextrins that are more difficult for the yeast to consume, and that results in a sweeter beer with more body. Cutting the mash short, is a recipe for disaster -- then the wort contains starch, which cannot be broken down by brewing yeast, but which does feed wild yeast and bacteria.

					Well, there are a few bottles on there now. Let's see how this goes.

					Are the bottles empty or filled up then? I can't really understand the question completely since English is not my mother tongue. My sincerest apologies!

					The bottles are full. I am worried about their contents.

					Radical temperature changes (if the beers get direct sunlight) are not ideal for the longevity of beer (or wine). This is why you traditionally hear of wine/beer-cellars. @Krugmeister65 is spot on, though.
