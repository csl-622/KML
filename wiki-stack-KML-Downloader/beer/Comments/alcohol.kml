					Hi!  This question is a bit rough around the edges, we could use a bit more for discussion here.  Are you looking for advice on how to avoid a hangover, or how to avoid being too drunk?  If so, rephrase the question for one of the more open-ended variations.

					Wow that wheel is amazing, thank you. And the style descriptions pretty much covers the official vocabulary, I guess.

					I didn't want to answer since this is such a broad question and google had so much information that I gave up. Here is a good overview http://cwoodlibrary.weebly.com/uploads/5/2/8/9/5289432/inns_and_taverns_in_the_middle_ages.pdf

					I like good no-nonsense answers like this.  But surely our resident wine expert can add something to this?

					Yup, you are right, and an unreserved apology is winging its way to you as I type - blimey, I only open my mouth to change feet!    Thank you for taking my comment in the manner in which it was written.  I'm off to sit in the corner now!

					@BryceH, please cite a source.  I've never heard anyone say beer doesn't age in bottles and it goes against all cellaring literature and practices.

					When I was about 15, I downed half a bottle of alcohol and then ate a loaf of bread and never got drunk. I told someone a few weeks ago and they said I was no way because eating bread to get sober was a myth. I'm seriously confused now? Wondering if I did get drunk but dont remember. But I remember I was with friends who questioned why I wasn't drunk after cheering me on to down the bottle; so I doubt it. People can be so weird.

					Nobody is going to do that. Why don't you buy a nice book on wine because that's how long it would take to put it all down in an answer. Here is a good general purpose book on the wines of the world https://www.amazon.com/New-Sothebys-Wine-Encyclopedia-Third/dp/0789480395
