					I doubt anyone can answer this with any veracity.  most likely it is just something to mark up as regional differences.  Sort of how all soda is called "coke" in the southern part of the US.

					Some bar in Southern Australia probably served pints in the wrong glass for a while and it became the standard there.

					Or else the wikipedia article is wrong.

					The Wikipedia article is verbose. I've never even heard a lot of those names used before. Pint and schooner sizes often differ between venues. There really isn't much of a standard except for perhaps legal definitions.

					Peach? Hm, I must look out for that one. I've only seen peach flavoured white beers. Thanks for the tip!

					@MrLister the peach is my favorite, followed by the gueuze.  (It's less sweet than some of the others -- I would order them peach &amp; apple (about the same), raspberry, and then cherry.)

					If the beer has more than 6% ABV it's no problem to cool it in the freezer. Put it there for 10-20 minutes and you'll have a nice cold beer. An imperial stout won't even ever freeze.

					@BillRawlinson: Your comment contains a nonsequitur. That regional differences exist in many things does not inherently preclude tracing provenance. Soda is probably called "Coke" in the southern US because Coca Cola is based in Georgia and has been the most popular carbonated beverage since carbonated beverages became popular. But yes what you say is certainly true otherwise, it might prove more difficult to find why other regions use "fizzy drink", "pop", "softdrink", "soda" or "soda pop". But it's still just "might" so you never know ...

					@anthony-arnold is correct, these names are sometimes so regional as to be different in neighbouring pubs. There are places in Queensland where a pot and middy (small and medium) are the only two glasses you'll find.  Don't know about SA, but in Cairns and Townsville the rumour is that smaller glasses sizes are so that you can drink your entire glass before it warms up...

					@PaulHicks Yes, I was chatting with a bar tender this weekend about that very thing. Apparently it's gone out of fashion now, but beers used to be served smaller so you could finish them while they were still cold.
