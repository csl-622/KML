					You would think that with the state of industrialization that there wouldn't be such big swings. Brewing before refrigeration didn't even happen during the summer months, so I doubt it's a 'traditional' variation. Intriguing data!

					Interesting, though November and December tied for the lowest average beer production since 2010, and there are a number of holidays during those months. I'll try to dig out some beer demand data for the United States to see how it matches up.

					@Leo, African beers tend to be pale lager. SAB also happens to own almost all of the African breweries, which again explains the pale lager trend. Some of the pale lagers are better than others, but I can't really think of a single beer that amazed me. The traditional beer (umqombothi [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umqombothi]) is an "interesting" beer. :p A few good breweries Devils Peak, CBC, Gilroys, Triggerfish, Cockpit, Chameleon. I will happily spend a day at any of these breweries drinking all of their beers!

					@MarceloMachado, I highly recommend that you take your journey seriously and take lots of notes. Your palate will grow immensely over the next year if you pay attention to what you are experiencing. Notes help you learn and it shows you how far you've grown (from stone fruit, to cherry, to black cherry). It also helps you to make sure that you don't accidentally buy a bad beer twice.

					Good idea @AtronSeige, from now on I will take lots of notes in order no learn. Beer really pleases me but I'm still a newbe. However a journey of a 1000(1001) miles begins with a single step.

					Thank you for this thorough answer.  "Grapes not in their home habitats" hadn't even occurred to me, and now that you point it out I can see how huge a factor that would be.

					I don't follow your point 3. Whatever grape juice you start with, making a more alcoholic wine will remove more sugar. If the market is demanding sweet wines, that would pressure towards lower alcohol levels. And what does that have to do with watering down the juice, anyway?

					What happens when you get to the upper echelons of natural fermentation, around 17-18% ABV the fermentations usually aren't completed and leave some sweetness behind. This is a stylistic thing. I know guys that purposely leave their fruit on the vine to raisin so it gives them that sweet flavor in their wine. This comes at a cost since the grapes are over ripe. Therefore, there is a lot of watering down to get them below a level of sweetness to complete fermentation. Otherwise they have a wine that is 17+% ABV and sweet.
