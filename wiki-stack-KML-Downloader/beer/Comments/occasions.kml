					It is really hard to find the _Goldbach Valley_ as it is a German name in the region where Czech names are normally being used currently. --- Here are the names in Czech: It is a valley of [_Blšanka_](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bl%C5%A1anka), formerly _Zlatý potok_ (Golden brook, in German Goldbach). The mentioned valley is near to [_Trnovany_](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trnovany_%28%C5%BDatec%29), small village which makes part of the town [_Žatec_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BDatec) (_Saaz_ in German).

					I usually hold the base of the bottle against my stomach and dig my thumbs into the cork as I push, rotate bottle, push, rotate bottle, etc. Not classy but works.

					I remove mine by holding the bottle firmly with one hand and pulling/twisting the cork with the other.  I've never had a problem from Delirium.  (I've never tried the "push with both thumbs" approach that some use; that seems harder to me.)

					From the ancient Egyptians to the Mayans and the Trappist and Cistercian monks there are many religious rituals around drinking non-wine alcohol. This question is almost too broad..

					Two options seem to work well for most people: drink one to two litres of water before sleeping, or have a glass of water after each alcoholic drink. Both of these approaches have been strenuously field tested for accuracy by a few dozen people I know with positive outcomes.

					"Destroy" in what sense?  Once a wine or bear is ready for bottling isn't it often pasteurized anyway to prevent secondary fermentation?  IIRC pasteurization can run upwards of 160F, which is already above the boiling point for a lot of the head components.

					Uh no... you never want to do this to wine or beer after fermentation is complete. It will ruin it.
