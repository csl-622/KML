					How much are you willing to spend? There are cheaper and more mass-produced ciders out there, as well as artisanal ciders that can run $30+/bottle. And where (approximately) do you live? With regional differences in distributions, just because something is available in the US doesn't mean it's available to you.

					@maxwelldeux - Mountain states.  Not many apple orchards around here.  And willing to try anything once, so price isn't that big of a deal.

					Interesting question. Not a cider drinker myself, but it might be something you have to do some manual Google searching for to find brands you'll like. AFAIK, the cider industry is relatively young and growing, so you might be out of luck.

					Good point. I've seen the odd America 750ml bottle in specialty stores that specify a French style or something similar. Most European ciders I've seen specify area of production, which roughly maps to cider style.

					Ah, well that is why I put the no can't have this that and the other requirements - for various reasons certain things are out, but I want it to be a surprise.  On the whole though, mr dougal can drink anything except red wine.  It's dougal who can't drink the other stuff, so I want us both to enjoy something together and not have to resort to two different things, as is normal.  Any suggestions - I'm fairly open to anything (alcoholic)!

					What sort of engagement are we talking here? Is this a blind date? Fancy, aged red wine for good first impression type deal? Or, is this for your main squeeze? Sex on the Beach would be an option type deal?

					Thanks! Indeed I have used a Chianti, fantastic. However, under suggestion of this [Italian site](http://www.saporiacasatua.com/prodotto/cacio-fiore/) I used a Gasperini and I appreciated the result. Though, I would like to go for a liquorous wine now, which will be even better, in my opinion. Do you have some in mind?

					@VincenzoOliva How exactly do you define a liquorous red wine: a fortified red wine, a red wine mixed with a liqueur or liquor or something else?

					I like the sex on the beach idea!  Especially as we live on a boat and beaches are always near.  No we have been together since since - well - I am so old now I cant remember!  It's just a 'Hey let's be romantic 'cos I still sort of love you evening'.  OK OK you can all go and be sick now!

					I hate to say it but OMG.  I have spent a lot of time in the Caribbean and in one bar for St patricks's day they served green, yes I did say green beer (larger), no one bought it and for a long time thereafter green beer was on offer in the bar - god knows what it did to people's kidneys!
