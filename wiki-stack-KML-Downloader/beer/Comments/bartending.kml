					I'm not sure what you're asking.  Do you want to meet such a bartender or just get a new recipe?

					Out of curiosity, why do you want specifically this bar spoon? Both smooth handles and muddlers are less common on barspoons. Both on a single spoon is, I think, interesting.

					The two-pronged opener (sometimes called a "dishonest butler") has saved me more than once -- sometimes because the cork was in poor shape, but also sometimes because I messed up the initial placement of a hand-held corkscrew and did the damage myself.  (Now I use a lever-style corkscrew -- much easier.)

					I have never seen this contraption before, but will look out for one - the amount of times I have had to poke the cork through and then strain makes for buying this a no brainer - thanks for the info.

					I fully agree with your answer but there's one more thing - your 5€ wine may well be the same $20 wine mentioned in the question. I've seen wines being sold for 3-5€ in a French supermarket that go for 10-15€ where I live.
