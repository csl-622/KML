					I met someone working for a large brewery company once who told me that the canned and the bottled version of their most popular brand indeed taste different, because for logistical reasons they are brewed in different cities and thus use water comming from different wells.

					Nearly all [glass bottled beverages are protected from UV rays](http://www.berghoffbeer.com/blog/what-does-the-color-of-your-beer-bottle-mean/) by additives in the glass itself, or by a coating on the bottle if the glass can't provide the needed protection.

					So for example, in the US, by regulation, a beer that is listed as 5% ABV may be anywhere from 4.5% to 5.5%. If a beer is listed as 0.6%, however, it must have no less than 0.5%. (This, I assume is due to the limit that defines a Non-Alcoholic beer). Correct?

					I heard a good quote once about cans.. They are essentially small kegs and our general pre-disposition against cans is just a cultural one and not one based on any intrinsic quality of the beer.

					That being said our expectations alter our perceptions (the brain is a crazy thing) so if you think something tastes better in a can and you know your drinking from a can you'll enjoy the canned beer more than a person who expects the canned beer to taste worse.

					How do you know the beer went from 7.2 to over 9% abv? That much sugar converted to alcohol would represent over 15 volumes of CO2, which would easily break a glass bottle (above 4 vols CO2 and you need champagne bottles). Priming sugar additions to carbonate a beer typically acount for 0.2-3% alcohol in the beer.

					perhaps you could also comment on this question - http://beer.stackexchange.com/questions/521/does-bottle-size-affect-aging-or-storage. The accepted answer indicates size doesn't make a difference.

					What about Guinness? Their bottle is cover with a plastic wrapping which would not let light in, however when I drink Guinness out of a can it is no where near as satisfying as the bottle.

					Depends on which ones. The rare lambics, high gravity trappist ales and such, I would imagine so. Regular beers, probably not.

					@Danny - Guinness uses a [beer widget](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget_(beer)) to manage head characteristics. Cans use a spherical "floating widget", while bottles use a "rocket widget". Maybe one style works better than the other?
