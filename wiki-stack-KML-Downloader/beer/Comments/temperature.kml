					No beer that i am aware of is served *warm*. Beer is served at *ambient temperature*, in particular the ambient temperature of the cool Northern European countries where it was perfected, i imagine because this is simply the easiest thing to do. There is a fizzy pale yellow liquid which is sometimes erroneously referred to as beer which is served cold; perhaps you are thinking of that?

					It's worth noting that the frosted appearance is not a requirement for an ice cold glass but is achieved by first rinsing the glass to coat it in water.  If you only rinse the outside, there shouldn't be extra ice on the inside.

					Typically, adjuncts (fancy term for extra things added) added during the boiling process are trying to have soluble things extracted from them and tend to appear as "hints of X." If you want the flavor to be prominent, the adjuncts are added during the fermentation process (called dry-hopping but can be done with things other than hops). You can of course, add oranges (for example) in the boiling AND fermentation phases. I have even seen people place additives in a french press, pour the beer in, and then press the beer into a glass.

					You're referring to the Reinheitsebot -  the German purity laws established in 1516. Even then, they were controversial, and their application to the rest of Germany in the late 19th century endangered a number of prominent and ancient traditions of spiced beers. While some breweries adhere to the purity laws as a point of pride, they are, as established originally, largely defunct, and certainly it doesn't account for the Sweetwater label you see...

					In that case, the term [Malt Beverage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malt_beverage) is actually an American term of art invented to encompass Beer in jurisdictions where 'beer' was in some way pejorative or bad for the industry image, or to refer to various low-alcohol flavored beverages that are served as 'beer alternatives', such as Mike's Hard Lemonade, or Smirnoff Ice.

					The glass in windows flowing thing is actually an urban legend. Yes, the glass is thicker on the bottom, because the technology of making the sheets of glass was flawed, and setting glass in windows was easier with thicker side down. You'd need more than a few hundred years for measurable glass flow effects.

					Note thermal capacity of these is much worse than ice cubes. 0.98 J/gK vs 2.11 J/gK for ice, 4.18 for water + a whooping 334 J/g of melting latent heat! So, 1g "reusable ice cube" frozen to -10C melting and heating to +5C will absorb 376 J while the stone will absorb mere 14.7J making them about 25 times more efficient!

					Trick is not to freeze the beer and not to dilute it. Tossing a chunk of dry ice into your beer might sound like a very simple and very efficient idea except you freeze some of the beer and it's not so good afterwards.

					@RoryAlsop: That's why I suggested "reusable cubes", ones where the 'coolant' is sealed within, for example, stainless steel case. BTW, where did I make a mistake? (10*2.11 + 334 + 5*4.18) / (15 * 0.98) = 376 / 14.7 = 25.578. True in case of "gel filling" the thermal capacity is worse, but the melting point is lower -&gt; higher temperature gradient -&gt; faster cooling.

					I'd pour the salt at the bottom, _then_ the ice and water, to dissolve that salt as evenly as possible. Otherwise you're pouring salt over the tops of ice and beers... Also, the reason this works is that ice alone would barely contact the beer (in terms of total surface area)â€”there'd be a lot of air in between, and air's a very effective insulator (hence double-pane windows). Adding water maximizes the surface area of contact, and adding salt lowers the freezing point of water to make the transfer of cold (technically, heat) more efficient.

					Well, like everything beer - judgement as to what is good vs bad will always come down to taste, and one should be tolerant to personal choice.

					The 70/30 ratio is interesting, and makes a lot of sense. As far as glasses go, a [tulip glass](http://www.outstandingbranding.com/images/NIRWoc4rAbfdMjjwGtnJJAGtGtMf/Tulip-Pint-Glass-57cl-20-1oz.jpg) generally works pretty well too.

					I think, in this case, "warm" is a relative term. Rather than saying that beer is commonly enjoyed "warm" in Europe, I'd say that it's not as cold as Americans tend to serve their beer. Still, I doubt it's anything above room temperature.

					This is mostly correct. Having owned a restaurant in Thailand where it's typical for a customer to stay ALL day and drink BYO whisky and still expect full service. My point is service costs and has to be taken into account. We made most of our profits on soda then ice then beer and nothing on spirits since it traditional in Thailand not to apply corkage or stop customers from byo-ing.

					@JackAidley: Good point which I stupidly overlooked, but it's also been pointed out that freeze distilling is not distilling unless you allow a sense "any process that results in higher alcohol". To paraphrase you, "Distillation is vaporizing and condensing; once you've frozen and removed a significant amount of water you've done something that I don't know what is but it ain't distillation." You are free to like it or not like it but it's not down to the definition of words. Your "it ain't a beer" is somebody else's "it is a beer". Nobody makes beer in a still (-:

					@hippietrail: There's a reason the modifier 'freeze' is used in 'freeze distillation' - you're correct that it's not technically a distillation process but that's the term that is used for it so them's the breaks. Since no widely drunk alcohol is freeze distilled there's no terminology for heavily freeze distilled alcoholic drinks, none-the-less I don't think it's reasonable to act like extensive post-production modification leaves it as still a beer: honestly, you may as well pour in absolute ethanol and claim the strongest beer.

					Well there's also a reason people call things beer that you don't feel are beer and them's also the breaks. That's the point. It's all arbitrary and subjective. I wouldn't be surprised if there are beers with ethanol, apparently the Kingfisher you get in India is regarded as unsafe by expats there (unlike the export variety). You could indeed make the world's strongest beer this way. I agree it's not a great record to go for but but some people do so them's the breaks. In the meantime it's probably best to come up with some term like "natural" or "traditional" or "Reinheitsgebot" beer...

					Welcome to Beer.SE! Actually, not everyone would agree that _"Nothing [is] better than [an] ice cold beer."_ Colder serving temperatures numb your taste buds (check out [some questions tagged "temperature"](http://beer.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/temperature)), taking away your ability to taste your beer. This is why American "macros" (_e.g._ Coors) often advertise their beverages in the context of "enjoying an ice-cold beer"â€”because you do _not_ want to taste the nuances of those beers at room temperature.

					imperial stouts are even served at room temperature! Of course, I'm not saying "ice-cold beers" _can't_ be pleasurable; indeed the sensation of coolness can be satisfying, especially after a hot summer day. But by serving all beers "ice-cold," not only would beer enthusiasts not be able to experience the finer differences in tastes of beers, but also we'd essentially marginalize the very art behind brewing: Why create unique (however nuanced) brews if no one can taste the difference?

					Cans will be fine, yes. As for bottles brown ones can probably take a couple of days of light and be fine as brown glass blocks some 90% of light. Green only blocks around 40% though and clear nearly 0%, so I would not expose either of them unless I was drinking them. Of course its best to just keep everything someplace cool and dark.

					I would agree with you.  The 2nd beer I put on tap was very temperamental and one thing I had to realize was that the setting on the regulator was the pressure of CO2 in the empty space of the keg, not necessarily the carbonation of the beer or even how much CO2 is coming out the tank.  Plus when you change the setting, it takes many hours to stabilize.  Also figure out some way to insulate the tap tower if you have one.  Warm beer in the upper foot of the tube has caused me lot of grief in the past.

					Some of the resealable metal ones coming out recently actually look quite appealing.  Same reason micro-canning and portable cannery businesses are beginning to take off.  Metal containers like cans, kegs, or metal growlers offer 100% UV protection and they'll generally chill faster than glass.

					So one reasonable (but perhaps overly cautious) approach would be to assume that any American liquor *does* have additives unless it explicitly disclaims them?  And only the additives disclaimed?  (E.g., is Absolut glaring in its mention of sugar while remaining silent on the common and sweet additive *glycerin*?)

					You don't need to drink a beer at room temperature. Find a stream, lake, pond or whatever and stick your beer in there for a while. If that's not available, dig a hole in the ground until the ground cools off. Stick the beer in there for a while with good contact with the soil. Cans work better for this. If you have an couple of hours, the beer might be at least cooled off into the 50s or 60s.

					As you can see by reading the post, the sugar content is exactly the same in both cases because both came from the canned cherries.  In addition, as you can see by reading the post, the juice is already very highly watered down.  Complete and 100% information was already given so it obviously is not possible to give "more".  The yeast, as mentioned in the post, came from when there is too-high amounts of yeast, which means that the only possibility of a place it can come from is the kombucha.

					Becoming a millionaire as well as spending literal tens of dollars for an ounce or two at a time of some kind of valid fermented drink (yes preferably wine but once again the first bottle of juice also just became carbonated) is obviously not a valid or reasonable thing to do, and of course anyone who has such a huge amount of money at one time could also simply buy alcohol, even if they wanted healthy/non-toxic alcohol.  The "juice" cab be drank on it's own though tastes much better when fermented as in the first bottle, and presumably as wine as well.

					Could you clarify the experiment? You have four temperatures and four durations specified, but only three cans of beer. Also, you can't "boil" something if the temperature is less than 212F. 149F for 30 minutes is not unlike driving home from the store with beer in a hot car trunk. Also it might matter if the beer was pasteurized.

					Good answer, but I would add that, in general, any major differences are going to come from ABV and hop content. According to my Untappd profile I've checked in 150 unique beers over the past several years, and the only ones I really recall standing out are very heavy IPAs and very strong beers. And even then it's mostly ABV that provides a difference. For instance, a beer at 11% is a *much* different beer than one at 5%

					@Muze The quickest way to make some hooch undercover is apple juice or grape juice. Welch's if you are from the USA. And some yeast. If no yeast add some grapes with skins on. Simple as that. Put the yeast (or grapes) in the juice, preferably in a bucket of some kind with a lid and let it rip. If using yeast, fermentation should start within hours. Grapes could take a couple of days. When it finishes fermenting put it in some kind of bottle with as little of the dregs as possible. Enjoy!
