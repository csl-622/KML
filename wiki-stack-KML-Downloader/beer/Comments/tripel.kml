					This doesn't really address your question, but I wanted to mention it anyway: dubels and tripels aren't just stronger versions.  The dubel, in particular, uses darker malts and candi sugar to achieve its dark color and rum / raisin sweetness.  The tripel instead uses lighter malts and white candi sugar for a very different character.  There is a progression in strength, but it's a little more complex than that.
