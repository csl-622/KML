					I don't think there has really been a scientific study on the beer glass shapes etc.  HOwever there have beeen some on wine http://www.aromadictionary.com/articles/wineglass_article.html  

					Which basically said the shape of a glass can affect the aroma but many shapes can have the same impact.  The major factor in aroma enhancement was the ratio of glass cup diameter to the diamter of it's opening.

					Check out the last study on the linked page for more info.

					Could you perhaps explain why it makes sense to consume more calories in cold weather than warm weather? It might _seem_ intuitive, but upon deeper thought I'm not sure why that should be true. For example, it's known that a cold body temperature leads to decreased basal metabolism—meaning less calories burned. Some say we're programmed to "stockpile" when the weather gets colder, but there are no studies that evidence this view; others say we become accustomed to higher caloric intake during winter due to the habit of celebrating holidays annually—but again, no studies.

					I will say that not only are they mostly decorative today but if you want a usable stein+lid that you should make sure the lid will open enough to get out of your way before you buy the stein.  I was gifted one and it is purely a decorative mug at this point due to the lid being in the way.

					["Pewter is now widely lead-free."](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tankard#Lead_leaching_from_pewter) Digging further into it, it appears that "lead-free" means having no more than 0.05% (500ppm) lead, as required by [FDA regulation 4-101.13](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/GuidanceRegulation/UCM188545.pdf). Unrelated comment: I think the pores in pewter mugs also have something to do with the taste, though I'm not sure. Whoever answers this question—feel free to incorporate any of this into the answer (without attribution); I'll delete this comment.

					just minor correction: carbonation does affect flavor, but when cooked, all the carbonation (including the flat flavor) will be cooked off.  So it would be more precise to say carbonation doesn't affect the flavor of the finished product.

					I doubt anyone can answer this with any veracity.  most likely it is just something to mark up as regional differences.  Sort of how all soda is called "coke" in the southern part of the US.

					Some bar in Southern Australia probably served pints in the wrong glass for a while and it became the standard there.

					@BillRawlinson: Your comment contains a nonsequitur. That regional differences exist in many things does not inherently preclude tracing provenance. Soda is probably called "Coke" in the southern US because Coca Cola is based in Georgia and has been the most popular carbonated beverage since carbonated beverages became popular. But yes what you say is certainly true otherwise, it might prove more difficult to find why other regions use "fizzy drink", "pop", "softdrink", "soda" or "soda pop". But it's still just "might" so you never know ...

					@anthony-arnold is correct, these names are sometimes so regional as to be different in neighbouring pubs. There are places in Queensland where a pot and middy (small and medium) are the only two glasses you'll find.  Don't know about SA, but in Cairns and Townsville the rumour is that smaller glasses sizes are so that you can drink your entire glass before it warms up...

					I had originally voted to close, but actually I'm going to repeal that decision (and sorry, my action undid existing close votes—of which there was one—feel free to re-vote to close). @Parability seems aware of that glass shapes have to do with aroma and taste, but specifically wonders whether Kwak's glass design is for that purpose. IMHO, it's not a duplicate.

This is why American "macros" (_e.g._ Coors) often advertise their beverages in the context of "enjoying an ice-cold beer"—because you do _not_ want to taste the nuances of those beers at room temperature.

					imperial stouts are even served at room temperature! Of course, I'm not saying "ice-cold beers" _can't_ be pleasurable; indeed the sensation of coolness can be satisfying, especially after a hot summer day. But by serving all beers "ice-cold," not only would beer enthusiasts not be able to experience the finer differences in tastes of beers, but also we'd essentially marginalize the very art behind brewing: Why create unique (however nuanced) brews if no one can taste the difference?

					Fair warning: the flame produced by burning alcohol can be almost invisible, particularly with high-ABV drinks that have a low sugar content. You could easily mistake a shot glass for having gone out when it is still very much alight!

					@mcraen There is a similar one already on [History SE](https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/42474/why-do-we-clink-glasses-and-say-cheers), But it is a little more convoluted, so I will stay here.

					Good answer, but I would add that, in general, any major differences are going to come from ABV and hop content. According to my Untappd profile I've checked in 150 unique beers over the past several years, and the only ones I really recall standing out are very heavy IPAs and very strong beers. And even then it's mostly ABV that provides a difference. For instance, a beer at 11% is a *much* different beer than one at 5%

					Sorry no prisoner is going to go through all this trouble to ferment something. Even I wouldn't go through this hassle and I can do whatever I want! Just some apple or grape juice in a bag is all you need.

					@Muze The quickest way to make some hooch undercover is apple juice or grape juice. Welch's if you are from the USA. And some yeast. If no yeast add some grapes with skins on. Simple as that. Put the yeast (or grapes) in the juice, preferably in a bucket of some kind with a lid and let it rip. If using yeast, fermentation should start within hours. Grapes could take a couple of days. When it finishes fermenting put it in some kind of bottle with as little of the dregs as possible. Enjoy!
