					https://belgiuminabox.com/shop/home/3972-de-ranke-xxx-bitter.html they seem to have it. They also state the reason why it's no longer brewed.

					I'm not sure American whiskey is the most common, actually - would be interesting to see the match up between whiskey, bourbon, port, brandy etc. I know for the whisky I laid down 2 years ago, whiskey wasn't even considered - port and brandy casks were much more accessible. Aside from that, have an upvote for a great answer.

					"English brewers learned to cover the negative flavor of their pale ales with more bittering hops." Also, hops keep beer from going bad in general.

					@RoryAlsop I agree it would be interesting to see some statistics on what barrels are used as I assume a port barrel would help produce a darker whisky than one that was aged in a bourbon cask

					Yup - I have gone for a lightly peated, mild smoked American Oak cask previously used for Port, in order to get a bit of color and depth so we'll see how it comes out in a few more years.

					According to this [site](http://kybourbon.com/bourbon_culture-2/key_bourbon_facts), about 260,000,000 liters of bourbon were made in 2014. Whereas [831,600,000](http://www.scotch-whisky.org.uk/what-we-do/facts-figures) liters of Scotch were *exported* in 2014. Seems Scotch annually outproduces bourbon by about 3-4x.

					If you can find Cabo Wabo, Sammy Hagar's Blue Agave tequila, it's very smooth and drinkable straight or in cocktails :-)

					I used to be skeptical of tequila before I started drinking it,  now I have learned to appreciate it.  Just like any other drink you need to find what you like about, I usually take small sips and try to swish and taste it with my whole tongue, I do this with my mouth closed this prevents the over powering taste of alcohol mask the flavor once I find the notes and taste I swallow it and open my mouth a little and breath through my mouth you will taste some undertones, once you know what you like about it you begin to enjoy it better, plus you get the added bonus of looking like a BOSS!
