					@user1126 - Could you clarify the platform? If Android, I'd like to close this question as a duplicate of the aforementioned. (A closed question does not affect or harm your reputation in any way.)

					You don't need to drink a beer at room temperature. Find a stream, lake, pond or whatever and stick your beer in there for a while. If that's not available, dig a hole in the ground until the ground cools off. Stick the beer in there for a while with good contact with the soil. Cans work better for this. If you have an couple of hours, the beer might be at least cooled off into the 50s or 60s.

					Hi Aleksander, and welcome to Alcohol StackExchange!  Since your answer directly contradicts several other answers, can you expand on why you believe 10C is an optimal serving temperature for all beer?

					Hi Mixhab, it would be useful if you could expand your answer to explain what in, and how water can impact the taste of beer.

					As you can see by reading the post, the sugar content is exactly the same in both cases because both came from the canned cherries.  In addition, as you can see by reading the post, the juice is already very highly watered down.  Complete and 100% information was already given so it obviously is not possible to give "more".  The yeast, as mentioned in the post, came from when there is too-high amounts of yeast, which means that the only possibility of a place it can come from is the kombucha.

					Becoming a millionaire as well as spending literal tens of dollars for an ounce or two at a time of some kind of valid fermented drink (yes preferably wine but once again the first bottle of juice also just became carbonated) is obviously not a valid or reasonable thing to do, and of course anyone who has such a huge amount of money at one time could also simply buy alcohol, even if they wanted healthy/non-toxic alcohol.  The "juice" cab be drank on it's own though tastes much better when fermented as in the first bottle, and presumably as wine as well.

					If the problem would be allegedly merely that "the yeast did not survive", then this should result in the same result as happened the first time.
