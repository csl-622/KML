					It (also) depends on country - for example in UK usually there is no or minimal amount of foam (possibly as they are serving Imperial pints of beer using standard glasses which leaves no room for foam - serving with foam could be considered cheating customer out of 2.4 fl oz. of beer).

					Here in New Zealand beers are typically served without foam, with the exception of Guinness. Drinkers will be displeased if you serve them a beer with foam, as they feel they are being ripped off (fill the glass to the top with beer).

					Here in japan the foam is quite important, and most of the time people know how to pour the beer in the right way to produce foam. In the Philippines though I remember my friends not liking being served beer with foam.

					Thanks! I figured there probably wasnt one because of the complexity of keeping tabs on it. I'm still going to keep it open in case someone else has any other sites. Oh and I would love the site to encompass both local and major brews but I understand it is far more difficult to get those local breweries on board.

					I've upvoted this answer because I agree with it generally.  I disagree that a beverage must contain hops in order to be beer.  Beer has been around far longer than hops have been, and even today there are gruit-style spice beers that are made without the assistance of hops.

					I realise my animal/vegetable/mineral style classification was poor, and I suppose that mead is more of a wine really, although the fact that they regularly include hops confuses things.  It would be interesting to see a chart showing this stuff, I have seen the like for beers, but not for the whole family tree of alcoholic drinks.  Thanks!

					Is it not more complex than that though? Gin can be made from starch, but it's not a beer.  Isn't it a mix of key ingredients and the process by which the end result is acheived (brewed/distilled etc)?

					Beer is not made from starch - the starch is broken down either during mashing (or malting for crystal malts) - so beer is fermented from mostly simple reducing sugars (mainly maltose), not starch.

					I think the addition of herbs and spices like hops to mead is more historic than contemporary.  The Dansk Mjod company that brews meads you'll often see in badass stone bottles spices all their meads and claim they base everything off historic 1700's recipes.

					I lost the ability to edit my comment, but I was going to add that considering the lengthy aging old mead underwent before we understood oxygenation and pitching rates and the less-than-sterile storage, the additional preservatives (like hops) were probably a good idea.
					As to the question at hand, I draw the line between beer and wine where any conversion had to happen to make sugars available for fermentation.  In mead you just take honey, filter out the bee chunks, add water and ferment...so Honey Wine.  Sake and barley-based beers require mash conversion, so beer.

					Its worth noting that the Reinheitsgebot was not pointlessly restrictive at the time it was made though. When it was first instituted it gave consumers a lot of faith in getting quality beer free of potentially dangerous preservatives (not hops) and at a reasonable price (the law also set a fixed price for beer). Eventually the law definitely stifled brewers creativity to an unreasonable degree, but the beer market would likely have been set back hundreds of years without the law.

					Also, aside from sours and outright fruit beers, much of the fruit flavors in Belgian beer is derived from just the malt and yeast. Just because you can taste hints of specific fruit does not mean the fruit is necessarily present. And by the way, the wild yeasts in Belgium that make great beer are the ones used in sours such as Lambics.

					All different kegs. 2 purchased from the Ontario beer store (bud light) and 1 purchased from a Craft brewer (Beau's). The last couple of times it has leaked beer from the coupler. At least half an ounce a hour from my estimation. It was working well until the leak, and when i take the o ring out now, it is still foamy.

					To add to this - you will often see "small batch" on American labels for blended whiskeys. You most certainly can have different flavors from the same whiskey's with different amounts added to the "small batch" (see Four Roses Brent Elliot's special release). But... this is also the reason certain labels no longer have age statements. Elijah Craig, for example, had to start blending different ages of their flagship spirit because of the "whiskey boom." A lot of companies didn't plan to have such a boom 10, 12, or 23+ years ago.
