					@JonEricson I hear you.  :-)  Additionally, I didn't mention that in many cases the price can dictate quantity as well.  People (myself included) don't seem to mind paying $10 for 6oz of a particularly special beer, but a $25 pint might be a good bit harder to sell.

					it is posible to brew low alcohol beers rather than boiling off. There are a few breweries here in the UK that produce as low as 2.6% ABV beers by brewing alone. They can't boil them off as that would kill the yeast and make them no longer real ales.

					I had originally voted to close, but actually I'm going to repeal that decision (and sorry, my action undid existing close votes—of which there was one—feel free to re-vote to close). @Parability seems aware of that glass shapes have to do with aroma and taste, but specifically wonders whether Kwak's glass design is for that purpose. IMHO, it's not a duplicate.

					I would suggest you trim down your question pretty seriously.  I'm going to try to answer some of the more cogent points, but there's a lot to this post that's unnecessary to the question and gives the sense of "drinking craft beer makes me cool".  I apologize if that's phrased offensively, but I think you'll spur a lot better discussion if you rephrase your post with less editorializing.

					That would HAVE to be "Coors Light - The Beer For People Who Don't Like The Taste Of Beer!". Absolutely no flavor. Zero. Zippo. Nada-roni. It's like drinking foamy water. Went to a company gathering once, and by the time I showed up the only beer left was Coors Light. Thought, "Hey - I've seen the commercials - gotta try one!". Popped the top on an unopened can (so no joke by co-workers), took a sip, looked at the can, and tried to figure out how they got the water in there! COMPLETELY! FLAVORLESS! But, y'know, GREAT STUFF if you don't like beer! "It's the wrong beer anytime!" :-)

					Framboise is one type of lambic (raspberry). The [one I'm familiar with](http://www.merchantduvin.com/brew-lindemans-framboise-lambic.php) is more like 3% alcohol, though, not 13.  (This is true of the Lindemans lambics in general.)  The peach (Peche) is less sweet than the Framboise, and cherry (Kriek) is more sweet as I recall.  (I didn't care for it so I've only had it once, a while ago.)

					I've found cannabis causes more of a psychological dependency, than a chemical dependency. It doesn't cause withdrawal systems, but the psycho-active component has a draw that keeps people coming back.

					Realistically, not significantly different from a sedative tea, except cannabis also tends to have an impact on motivation levels, and the psycho-active aspect can cause people problems.

					I suppose the high concentration of alcohol may have decomposed the sucralose compound in Splenda in some why that impacts your headaches. Perhaps this isn't happening when you consume the Splenda in food. In any case, I'm believing this batch is probably a loss for you.

					I once had a Madeira that was about 225 years old. It was made when George Washington was still alive. It was probably the best alcoholic beverage I have ever had.

					My Dictionary translated as "ethereal", what Wikipedia translates as "essential", but also writes: "Essential oils are also known as volatile oils, ethereal oils, aetherolea, or simply as the oil of the plant from which they were extracted, such as oil of clove". The group of essential oils is wider and does not only include Ester, but also different types of Alcohol, Terpene and Ketone. Well, I am no chemist, for further information, please check Wikis.

					I simply wanted to point out, that ingredients often contain more substances that vaporize under different conditions than alcohol and might get lost in distillation, unless being extracted separately.

					I know what you are trying to get at. I worked for a water beverage company for a while and watching the chemists put together a flavored water drink was eye opening. Part of the problem is that what people think something tastes like is different to what they are used to tasting artificial flavors. Plus, economically, much easier to manufacture a flavor that is color stable and won't separate or settle with time. Think about the "oils" you are talking about. Some may dissolve and some might separate. It's all very complicated and I am not a chemist in any way...

					Yes, very sad that people prefer stable but artificial taste instead of nature. I made the same experience with sparkling orange lemonade. Made with fresh orange juice is very much different to supermarket standard products. Nevertheless, wine (at least good one) does not need artificial supplements and what would be so bad on recommending a period in which a spirit is best with its taste?

					Best I could do: Macerate elderflower in grape brandy of Burgundy, Tamay or Chardonay origin, and Pinot noir. Redirect part of this, filter the other part and assemble a grape brandy (preferably Burgundy, Tamay, Chardonnay) and Pinot noir. Add sugar cane - not much otherwise it'll be too sweet. Also instead of sugar try lyche liqueur.  -José cine Bartender (mixologist), studying sommelieria Cozumel palace

I'm already doing that, just another question, In a week, how much wine is socially too much? I mean, I'm usually going to some sales and bring back a lot of bottles, and they kind of ask me to taste them...

					your statement; "A column of vapor has increasingly higher temperature(s) toward the top, lower temperature(s) toward the bottom" is inherently and indisputably incorrect as it relates to distillation. Lower boiling point components boil off first (at lower temperature) and condense last as they travel up the distillation column. The coolest material that remains a vapor will always be higher in the vapor column. Hot at the bottom, cool at the top.

					- Jimmy, I remember the Column (12"D) in my university Chemistry Building (30ft apx). It filled with glass beads (2"apx). It was designed by our Dean of Science and Chem Dept Head. 
					- He also invented Plastic Explosive. He carried a crate of it on his lap in a Douglas C-47, to the WW2 troops. He told us about how the ground &amp; flight crew personnel were terrified of its explosive potential because they thought it was like Nitro Glycerin. They just would not believe his explanation that it was harmless unless fused with a detonator.

					Are you eating when you are drinking these wines? That can have a profound impact on the flavors. Also, it could be the way the glasses are cleaned. What are you used to drinking for red wines. I am a lover of Austrian reds and they are pretty high on the fruit scale and low on the oak.

					Grapes are roughly 16% sugar, and of course they work. Highly doubt limes or cucumbers at &lt;2% will work without first adding external sugar and for limes correcting acidity. Also, good luck with avocado, where even if you can get a "juice", contains basically no sugar to ferment.

					We use apples without any additions and they are pretty low sugar. They just happen to have a high level of Malic acid. The question is can all fruits be turned into wine and of course the technical answer is no. But let's assume the OP meant your typical fruit at the grocery store. Then yes, most can with the addition of sugar and acid. Only apples and grapes pretty much have everything needed to make an alcohol beverage without cooking or additions.

					Question literally says "*all* fruit". In any case, that point was tangential, as is clearly implied by "This is completely discounting..." verbiage in the last paragraph. If you want to stop after the first two paragraphs, fine... the answer is still "no". No issue with your answer to the "why are grapes best" question.
