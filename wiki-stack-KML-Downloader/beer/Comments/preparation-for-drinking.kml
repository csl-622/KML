					Hi!  This question is a bit rough around the edges, we could use a bit more for discussion here.  Are you looking for advice on how to avoid a hangover, or how to avoid being too drunk?  If so, rephrase the question for one of the more open-ended variations.

					I suspect where you live might be a major factor in the sort of beer taps you see. In Southwestern Ontario, for example, I see mostly pressure taps, but in England a Real Ale must, by definition, be pumped. The main difference is that Real Ale is naturally carbonated, while other styles allow artificial supplementary carbonation.

					You should be able to find many pressure taps in England. With the popularity of American and European lagers there (Heineken, Budweiser, etc), they would be not be served from a hand pump. Guinness is served on a nitrogen mix from a pressure tap. Even many English beers are not Real Ale. Try some different pubs.

					Stouts get some of their bitterness from the roasted barley: Think of black coffee, which is bitter. Perhaps you are thinking of an imperial stout where a very high gravity from malt must be balanced by a high hop IBU. An Irish Dry stout is a low gravity beer that may be as low as 35-40 IBUs.

					@Beerhunter To be whisky it needs to be a high proof spirit, from distillation (not freezing), made from grain or a psudo-grain (e.g., buck wheat) If you use a pot still (e.g., scotch) you need at least two distillations to get the required proof. If you use a continuous/column still you only need one distillation to get the required proof. Bourbon is often distilled in a  continuous/column still. Make sense?

					To expand on your point on Scotch - Scottish Whisky (spelt without the 'e') must be aged for at least 8 years before barreling. Irish Whiskey (with the 'e') can be shoved into a bottle pretty much immediately.

					@AaronLavers 8 years is the minimum age that scotch may be labelled with.  That is, if there is any whisky in the blend less than 8 years old, you can't label the bottle with an age.  Another rule is that the age on the bottle is that of the youngest whisky in the blend.  My understanding is that these laws were created because Scotch whisky had a really bad reputation at one time.

					I liked the Auchentoshan 12... a bit hot, but had a quick vanilla note at the end.  And I think I got it relatively cheaply as a special import at Total Wine (not exactly sure what the deal was, but it was bottled differently and packaged as a part of a series from different distileries).

					The current Costco varieties are far, far better than their price point.  If you like bourbon, pick up their $25 bottle.  I think it's from the Knob Creek distillery, but mixed to a different proof... very good for the price.

					"Cook with a wine you would drink".  There are other reasons for this, besides the fact that you want good flavors in your food - you just about never use the entire bottle for your dish, so you might as well drink the rest while you're cooking!

					That will depend on the type of martini  you are planning to make! A dry martini, a traditional martini or a specialty martini, all require different types of gin. Personal tastes will also play into this equation.

					it is probably the sugar in the sprite that is keeping you up/making you not sleep well ! :) Try drinking that volume of sprite, but without the vodka, and see how well you sleep. Then drink the same amount of whisk(e)y as you would vodka, but drink it with water.

					When I was about 15, I downed half a bottle of alcohol and then ate a loaf of bread and never got drunk. I told someone a few weeks ago and they said I was no way because eating bread to get sober was a myth. I'm seriously confused now? Wondering if I did get drunk but dont remember. But I remember I was with friends who questioned why I wasn't drunk after cheering me on to down the bottle; so I doubt it. People can be so weird.
