					I don't think there has really been a scientific study on the beer glass shapes etc.  HOwever there have beeen some on wine http://www.aromadictionary.com/articles/wineglass_article.html  

					Which basically said the shape of a glass can affect the aroma but many shapes can have the same impact.  The major factor in aroma enhancement was the ratio of glass cup diameter to the diamter of it's opening.

					Check out the last study on the linked page for more info.

					Brian, I fear we are going off on a tangent, but its somewhat tricky to say that wines "don't age".  It's true that today, as 100 years ago, most wines are drank more or less as soon as they are released.  However, as 100 years ago, there are still plenty of modern wines that can, or _should_, be left to sit for 2 years, 5 years, 10 years, or longer.  It is the uncommon wine that will age a "long" time, but it has nothing to do with whether a wine is bottle fermented.

					Sounds like a physics question to me. There are a lot of variables including starting volume, how fast you drink, atmospheric pressure, shape and type of container, [whether the beer is stirred](http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/5265/cooling-a-cup-of-coffee-with-help-of-a-spoon), etc. and so on.  For me, I can keep drinking the same beer for as long as the poker game lasts. ;-)

					Does it matter how the fish is prepared? For example, the fish cooked in beer/ale that I've seen tended to be deep fried. If the fish is grilled or baked (and perhaps seasoned), would an ale or amber still be appropriate or may there be a better option?

					@ThomasOwens good point.  When I think of tilapia and similar fishes I think of poached, baked, or grilled, not deep-fried (which I don't have a lot of experience with -- I don't deep-fry at home, and when out the beer options may be limited or non-existent).

					I don't think that you're on the right track here.  You can have a pale ale or pilsner that's just as light as a lager; it's not ale vs. lager yeast.  IPAs DO have a considerable amount of hops -- that's what makes them IPAs.  Hefeweizen does NOT necessarily have a significant amount of yeast left over; that cloudiness is not yeast related.

					If you ever have a chance to try Alexander Keith's IPA, please do. It's not a very good beer, but it is an example of an IPA that I don't think is hoppy (many of my friends who don't like most IPAs do like it). Are you sure about Hefeweizen? [Wikipedia begs to differ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hefeweizen#Weissbier).

					There's two different kinds of categories - aroma, flavor and mouthfeel, and to some extent appearance, are subjective. Ingredients are objective. I'd argue that the 'true source of variation' in the subjective factors is the ingredients. The brewing process certainly contributes, but the ingredients determine almost all of the other characteristics. E.g. if you use roasted barley and belgian yeast, you're going to get a dark belgian beer, regardless of process, although process will influence the subjective variables.

					Agreed that this is a bad question.  There are huge numbers of variables and one missing one is what kind of beer it is.  Some beers are better to drink warm and especially if you go with some specialty beers, some may not be carbonated to begin with (and therefore don't go flat).  This can't be answered other than "it depends."

					I think this question is too broad as written, but if you focus it on major competitions you'd encounter as a consumer (not as a prospective entrant), that would be a valuable question.  Maybe you could ask about entering craft-brewing competitions separately.  (Be sure to explain what you seek to get out of the experience; don't just ask for a list.)

					Could you perhaps explain why it makes sense to consume more calories in cold weather than warm weather? It might _seem_ intuitive, but upon deeper thought I'm not sure why that should be true. For example, it's known that a cold body temperature leads to decreased basal metabolism—meaning less calories burned. Some say we're programmed to "stockpile" when the weather gets colder, but there are no studies that evidence this view; others say we become accustomed to higher caloric intake during winter due to the habit of celebrating holidays annually—but again, no studies.

					I'm will post an answer when able. To start get to know the ingredients. Hops have different aromas and impart different flavors (on top of giving a buttering quality). You can also pick beers that are know for being "chocolatey" or "x" and start to distinguish subtleties on your own. Never hurts to talk to local specialty shops and see if they are doing tastings. Groups like that love talking beer.

					While beer is inherently a subjective matter and we should give leeway in the questions here, this feels like an altogether subjective question.  I can see this being rephrased to cover a certain ground or topic, but answer a question this broad will certainly differ from many people's, and there isn't really a "correct" answer.

					I think, in this case, "warm" is a relative term. Rather than saying that beer is commonly enjoyed "warm" in Europe, I'd say that it's not as cold as Americans tend to serve their beer. Still, I doubt it's anything above room temperature.

					This doesn't really address your question, but I wanted to mention it anyway: dubels and tripels aren't just stronger versions.  The dubel, in particular, uses darker malts and candi sugar to achieve its dark color and rum / raisin sweetness.  The tripel instead uses lighter malts and white candi sugar for a very different character.  There is a progression in strength, but it's a little more complex than that.

					@JamesHenstridge - I wasn't quite sure whether to accept or reject your edit. I believe "sovjet" _is_ a valid spelling of "soviet," and 2,3-pentanedione and 2,4-pentainedione are distinct chemical compounds, but I personally don't know which is related to brewing. If you insist on the edits, please try again and this time I won't interfere. Thanks.

					Well, I am russian, and I am quite surprised with your interpretation. I've never heard of any beer brewing company here using honey during brewing or for bottling purposes. But I have one friend who tried to start brewing beer, so I'll ask him if that is relevant for the process here. It's always interesting to know something new about native country from unexpected sources =).

					As long as it's still called a "Beer" it's a legit answer I guess. It just has to be labeled as a freeze-distilled beer and not as a brewed one if it isn't. But there are just as many different answers right now as when I googled for the strongest beer...  ^^

					The original was ratified, in Bayern at least, in 1516. As I understand it, it was to prevent the monastaries from adding potentionally harmful ingredients. Besides, the current [Biersteuer](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bierstg_2009/__2.html) is only a fraction of the [Branntweinsteuer](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/branntwmong/__131.html). Using other additives wouldn't skirt taxes, it would increase them.

					@iamnotmaynard: That could be according to a US legal classification. Other English speaking countries don't even use the term "liquor". This brings up the question of since countries have varying different legal definitions of beer (In Japan this gives us oddities such as "happoushu"), is there a natural definition of beer, or do we need to come up with our own definition for the purposes of the site?

					@ValentinGrégoire Well, in the question, Wayne specifically asks for beers that don't have a particularly strong flavor profile, which is why a sweet lambic is a good choice, and probably why your Gueuze recommendation isn't getting much traction. Gueuzes in my experience are typically are quite strongly flavored, and so aren't really a good fit for this scenario.

					It depends... Each state can have their own laws on how things get done. Then are you talking kegs or cans/bottles? The laws can vary between those two also. In general, through a distributor and could be the same one the store is getting their beer from too.

					When you say "each state" I assume you mean within the US. This answer refers to all of the alcoholic drinks served by pubs, bars, restaurants etc. that I have in depth knowledge of, all of which are within Europe. I have tried to put in detail of all of the wholesale supply chains that I could think of and I didn't know of any significant differences between Europe and the US.

					I would say no.  Wayne's linked to the video that explains why the founder of The Alchemist thinks you should drink his beer from a can and he knows best how he wants his beer to be experienced, but for me, the scent and flavor restrictions are too much.  Don't get me wrong, I certainly enjoy drinking beer from a can, (and I'm drinking one from a bottle right now) but it's just better in a proper glass.

					I would suggest you trim down your question pretty seriously.  I'm going to try to answer some of the more cogent points, but there's a lot to this post that's unnecessary to the question and gives the sense of "drinking craft beer makes me cool".  I apologize if that's phrased offensively, but I think you'll spur a lot better discussion if you rephrase your post with less editorializing.

					@mchid Don't confuse skunky with sulfur-y.  It's been pretty well proven that UV light will cause alpha acids from hops in beer to break down and smell like a skunk: http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-01/beersci-why-you-should-never-drink-beer-clear-glass-bottle
					Some lager beer will have a sulphur-y smell.  The aging process is supposed to clear this up, but if it's cut short intentionally or otherwise the smell will linger.  Some styles or brewers prefer this.

					@mchid additionally, there's an odd amount of effort gone into some of these imports to make them taste "off", like they did when originally imported pre-prohibition.  While preservation techniques have improved, the desire for traditional taste came along with it, causing brewers to specifically introduce what they originally considered flaws.

					Additionally:  Lots of dry (rather than sweet) beers are fairly low calorie.  Guinness as an example only has 125 calories per 12 ounce serving, which is barely more than Bud Light.

					Also session beers which are low in alcohol will also have fewer calories than their more boozy compatriots.

					Wit a little more searching I came across: [this source](http://www.binnys.com/blog/binnys-mailbag-re-refrigerating-beer/) that seems to suggest that it doesn't matter, and [this source](http://lemonlye.livejournal.com/80537.html) which seems to suggest that re-refrigerating is bad for beer, and *definitely* bad for wine. I did hear about this from my friends, though it seems to be a general superstition(?). There seems, however, to be [scientific evidence](https://beersensoryscience.wordpress.com/2011/03/17/lightstruck/) of beer being affected by light.

					@AndrewCheong I didn't know Beer.SE even existed when I posted this question to Skeptics.SE, so you're right, I had no idea there was a duplicate (though I would have easily found it if I had even thought to look for Beer.SE). That said, it is appropriately marked as duplicate. I appreciate the answers everyone has given regardless, but I'm waiting on feedback to [my Meta question](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/246366/migration-to-a-site-with-no-account-prevents-quick-account-deletion-feature) before I take any further action (votes/accept) on Beer.SE.

					Cans will be fine, yes. As for bottles brown ones can probably take a couple of days of light and be fine as brown glass blocks some 90% of light. Green only blocks around 40% though and clear nearly 0%, so I would not expose either of them unless I was drinking them. Of course its best to just keep everything someplace cool and dark.

					I would agree with you.  The 2nd beer I put on tap was very temperamental and one thing I had to realize was that the setting on the regulator was the pressure of CO2 in the empty space of the keg, not necessarily the carbonation of the beer or even how much CO2 is coming out the tank.  Plus when you change the setting, it takes many hours to stabilize.  Also figure out some way to insulate the tap tower if you have one.  Warm beer in the upper foot of the tube has caused me lot of grief in the past.

					Some of the resealable metal ones coming out recently actually look quite appealing.  Same reason micro-canning and portable cannery businesses are beginning to take off.  Metal containers like cans, kegs, or metal growlers offer 100% UV protection and they'll generally chill faster than glass.

					Thank you for replying!  For $1 a pint it's hard to not like Beck's, but I swear there is a taste in it that reminds me of the new Miller High Life, PBR, etc... a taste I attribute to inferior/cheaper grains like rice or millet.  I could be completely wrong, I'm just an amateur beer brewer and pro drinker... but i admit freely that strong hops have wrecked my palate for mild beers.

					I had to read your post a few times to try to understand what you're asking. (Your title is about red lagers, but you start by mentioning red ales, then generic lagers, then IPAs, browns, and stouts, and your final question appears to be about _all_ beer, in general.) Let me try to distill a singular question here, to help others: **What is the characteristic taste, or, what are some _words_ that describe the taste, that makes a lager a _red_ lager?**

					You're right @AndrewCheong, I started just wanting to know what other beers I could try, but as I was writing the question I started trying to ask too much at once.

					I've simplified my secondary question to just your summary, which I agree is the basis of what I was trying to ask anyway. Maybe once I've got a response I'll try to ask the 'other' part of the question separately.

					Thanks for the feedback.

					Actually, _every_ Belgian I've ever had tasted this way, from Chimay to St. Bernardus—that's primarily how I identified Belgians by taste, and I thought it was "the thing" about Belgians people liked... Perhaps it _is_ just body chemistry, like cilantro tasting like soap for some people...

					The funny thing is that Belgium makes a huge variety of beers, with different yeasts and processes. Maybe they all use similar malt and water, but I'd really expect there to be exceptions. Do any beers beside Killian's do this? Do you eat similar foods when tasting these?

					I guess I'm talking about dubbels, tripels, quadrupels, like Chimay and St. Bernardus... but come to think of it, Delirium Tremens has the metallic taste as well (I remember, because it was one of the first beers I didn't like, for that reason). You're right, it does sound odd. But I'm pretty sure if you blindfolded me and gave me a mix of tasters, I would pick out the Belgians by that metallic taste—the metallic taste might even be _the_ characteristic that makes me think, "Oh, it's a Belgian." Maybe the characteristic Belgian taste just tastes "metallic" to my body.

					Have you checked out any of the research by Martyn Cornell and Ron Pattinson?  Latest word from them, and Mitch Steele who collaborated with Ron when he wrote his IPA book a few years back, seems to cast some doubt on the idea that IPA was named specifically for India.  Extra hopping was mandated for all beer shipped to warm climates and the first recorded use of "East India Pale Ale" was from an Australian newspaper in 1829 advertising beer for sale.  They've got a lot of very interesting research on beer history.  Just curious if you checked them out or had thoughts on them?

					addt'l: Same guys, same historical research suggests the year of aging prior to shipping was to allow a Brettanomyces character to develop in the beer, which probably helped add to its dryness.  Many historic English beers at the time were aged or mixed, probably because this flavor was desired.

					Last note, I promise:  Bottling was pretty rare until very late 1800s because of sanitation difficulties.  Pasteurization wasn't invented until 1876.  Beer would've been shipped in wood casks and likely tapped and served from them.  It's still very common practice to dry hop cask ales, and beer would've been hopped before shipping.  Hop aroma WILL fade over time, these are methods of getting it back which are not available with aged bottled beer.  Modern IPA and historic IPA are two very different beasts, and are intended to be treated differently.

					I am not a beer historian or know in detail about historical facts about IPA. But my own experiences have been very revealing as I use various ingredients and techniques in controlled settings. For instance, I was a fan of many or all U.S. craft IPA's in the past, but five years ago as I made over 30 test batches of single malt single hop IPA's, I become accustom to an ale that was dryer and lighter in body as I was using pale malt only and one hop type per batch.  As I drank the commercial craft IPA's again, I then understood,  simple was better for many reasons as both a brewer/drinker.

Also, the use of multiple yeast strains like a cult beer like heady topper that uses a combination of yeasts that include more "fruity" tasting yeasts which probably include English and Belgium type yeast strains, this is my opinion as I taste this IPA. I make this point because the direction of IPA's set by west coast style IPA has been deceptive to the consumer, because of their over use of crystal malts.

					Surely there are IPAs that are designed to be aged.  We live in a great time for beer; brewers are trying all kinds of recipes.  Given that they call Enjoy After an IPA, I will trust that they started with an IPA recipe, but I doubt that you will get a strong hop characteristic after the recommended open date.  I would think that the souring characteristics would take over.  Not to say that it doesn't matter that it started as an IPA, but that the flavor profile that defines an IPA will likely take second chair.  Ultimately, when it comes to aging, there isn't a science, but a rule of thumb.

					just beginning to learn about beer...have found much information on this site thank you ... I have been a wine collector for many years. Please do know with confidence that there are many "modern" day wines that age. I have a vast selection of 2000 and 2005 bordeaux that have not even reached the beginning of their maturity window yet and will age well for 30 to 50 years or more....

					Ah, this does remind me that while traveling in Asia it was very common to find breweries that serve a standard (or "gold" or "light" or "blond" or "yellow") beer, and a "black" or "dark" beer, usually lagers, as well as a blend of the two. (Many of the "Asian" breweries however were actually German or Czech.) Examples: Sapporo Yebisu (Japan), Lion Brewing (Vietnam, but German), Gammer Beer (Vietnam, but Czech), Koryo Hotel (North Korea). I was thinking more of non-lager, U.S. styles however. But these are all interestng blends you mention.

					Dubbels and Tripels as naming originated in Westmalle wich is a belgian trappist brewery. The fact is that there are a lot of trappists (monks) in the netherlands (historic region so belgium + modern netherlands) so the beer they make often is typical for their region. Also the protected trappist beer name only concerns designation not style.

					This is called a "Blacksmith" in a lot of bars in the US (well, the handful of bars that carry anything other than Guinness and Bass). "Black and Tan" would be Guinness/Bass, "Half and Half" is Guinness/Harp. There are other cutsie names based on the beer + Guinness pairing. AFAICT Guinness can layer on any CO2 beer. Not tried to layer it with another nitro beer like Boddingtons, but maybe with a careful pour? A bunch of Guinness combos are listed here http://www.theperfectlyhappyman.com/various-guinness-combinations/

					I'm sorry if this sounds silly but it's not meant to be.  In terms of drinking the half-and-half, would you use a straw?   Besides temperature differences to keep the bears seperate what else could you do (when drinking) to drink half and half and not simply a mixture of 2 bears.  I thought of making this comment a question of it's.  If I get an answer perhaps I will.

					It is all a matter of preference.  If you want to be fun, you could use a straw and drink the bottom beer first.  The layered look is done as much for aesthetics as anything else.  I tip them to my mouth as usual, maybe sometimes trying to take care not to disturb it too much, but it really starts to mix once you've brought it to your mouth and back.  Check out [this page](http://www.theperfectblackandtan.com/blog/category/Triple%20layer) for some excellent examples of layered beers (even 3 layers).

					Wow. This is a broad question. I believe there is a wide variety of acceptable answers (aka Bailey's Irish Cream in coffee). However, this is largely going to be based on your taste buds. My recommendation is experiment! I like adding Crown Royal to Dragon's Milk (a beer) but hate other whiskey's in Dragon's milk. Try balancing flavors - Sweet or "malty" beers (Porter/Stouts) offset the bitter of coffees. If you like "creamy" textures try adding Nitrogenated beers to your coffee.

					Most of the wine made by Rome within their vast Empire was done so in order to keep the legions of soldiers fed and watered, ready to defend the Empire. The wine was added to local water in an effort to make it more palatable and to pass on the health-giving properties of wine (drunk in moderation) to the soldiers and the patrician classes who turned up their noses at the watered down stuff.

					I do think it's clearer. I'm not sure there's a hard and fast answer though, and it's probably on a sliding scale that includes not just ABV but also flavors and mouthfeel (tannins, etc.) and your BAC: if you've polished off a bottle of wine, the next glass is probably going to taste blander than your first.

					Well, I think there may be two different questions: 1) at what point does ethanol impede rather than enhance the flavor of the current sip, and 2) what factors cause taste perception to diminish or skew for subsequent sips. I have anecdotal thoughts on both of these, but no real numbers. I think it will probably be "it depends".

					While I agree in principle, if you have a sip of 91% spirit (even much lower), you should probably wait for your taste buds and nasal passages to recover, which may take a decent while, before tasting anything else that requires any discernment. This taste impairment is quite apart from any intoxication, and I would say that it qualifies as a "problem for taste" that the original question asks for.

					@David in my opinion, some bottles are well known "bombs" and they are produced to be tasted exactly that way, no matter how you have to wait to recover your throat, productors certainly doesn't require you to finish one bottle in half an hour.

					Alcohol is metabolized in the liver where it's broken down so no matter how you ingest your alcohol (smoking, eating, vaping, intravenous) it still has to go through your liver. It's a well known fact that the purer the alcohol the smaller the hangover. See Grant and Tory on Mythbusters when they get drunk on beer then vodka and test the strength of their hangovers. The vodka hangover is clearly not as bad.

					I agree that any answers to whether or not vaping alcohol is a fad would be based largely on conjecture and should be edited out. However, that was a small part of the question. The safe use of, and the effect on the lungs, are excellent questions. I'd say that of course any answers posted online should be taken with a dose of skepticism and always ask a real doctor. I also think you'll get better answers on Health SE. But this question deserves to stay open.

					@mcraen I believe your suspicion is fundamentally incorrect. Higher ethanol concentrations mean the formation of more ethanol micelles which tend to trap aromatics. Adding water will  interfere with the micelles, releasing flavor and aroma. This has nothing to do with harshness. You will get *more* (and more varied) flavors with judicious dilution. Just don't go overboard, and remember to choose what you like best, which may indeed be cask strength... As long as you've tried the alternatives, it's probably best (in any situation in life) to strongly consider discarding received "wisdom".

					There is a point, usually around $20 or so where the quality doesn't increase proportionally with the price. So a $40 bottle of wine isn't double the taste or value. $80 dollars isn't going to give you twice the pleasure as a $40 bottle... Then you start moving into Veblen Goods area and wine "collectors".

					@MatthewWhited - There are a wide range of flavoring malts - crystal, black, chocolate and other additions where almost all the sugars are not in a form that are readily digestible by the yeasts.  This adds body, flavor and sweetness because they remain unfermented.  Crystal, especially, with the lower "degrees" of the crystal malts favor sweetness.

					And some yeasts are naturally "top-fermenting" while others are not. A bottle of beer with yeast in it generally keeps longer and continues to (slightly) change in flavor is it ages.  In regards to the "colour of the bottle" - light/sunlight is the #1 factor is a beer going "skunky."  Clear is the worst, green is also not great. The trendy practice of adding a lime to a Corona started because it was needed to choke down that crappy, cheap, skunky beer.

					The "Soupe au Vin" is the "Soupe au Vin" whether it is "sucré" (sugared) or not. [Soupe de vin rouge froide](http://allrecipes.fr/recette/7317/soupe-de-vin-rouge-froide.aspx). I Lived in France, where we simply called it the "Soupe au Vin". In any case, Thank you for your recommendation.

					Are you eating when you are drinking these wines? That can have a profound impact on the flavors. Also, it could be the way the glasses are cleaned. What are you used to drinking for red wines. I am a lover of Austrian reds and they are pretty high on the fruit scale and low on the oak.

					Grapes are roughly 16% sugar, and of course they work. Highly doubt limes or cucumbers at &lt;2% will work without first adding external sugar and for limes correcting acidity. Also, good luck with avocado, where even if you can get a "juice", contains basically no sugar to ferment.

					We use apples without any additions and they are pretty low sugar. They just happen to have a high level of Malic acid. The question is can all fruits be turned into wine and of course the technical answer is no. But let's assume the OP meant your typical fruit at the grocery store. Then yes, most can with the addition of sugar and acid. Only apples and grapes pretty much have everything needed to make an alcohol beverage without cooking or additions.

					Question literally says "*all* fruit". In any case, that point was tangential, as is clearly implied by "This is completely discounting..." verbiage in the last paragraph. If you want to stop after the first two paragraphs, fine... the answer is still "no". No issue with your answer to the "why are grapes best" question.
