					I would start with a clear, strong (68 % alc./vol.) Absinthe to begin with.   "Absinthe that is bright green may be artificially colored. However, not all quality absinthe has a green color. Quality absinthe may also be clear, orange, or red, but the color should be imparted by natural herbal ingredients such as petite wormwood."

					I just realized "kinds of hops...kinds of flavors" seem like a hop-link and hop-flavor link. They are, in fact, the same concept... One is a wheel and the other is an Excel-style list.

					But absinthe is traditionally made with wormwood. If you want to make wormwood-based absinthe, it must be green for chemical reasons (as the herb itself gives the beverage the color). Though clarifying, I'm asking about _how_ can green absinthe be colored other way.

					Nice for adding the picture. As I suspected, these are Czech-style but, this is a great example because these are in fact... Spanish. Just goes to show that Czech-style doesn't necessarily mean from the Czech Republic. Also notice that three of them are well over 70% ABV. On a personal note, nice observation about the primary colors and theories as to solutions. I wouldn't have noticed. If you don't made my saying, I think you'd make a fine chemist.

					This is the second question I've seen regarding Absinthe here recently.  In all my years of drinking I've never heard of it except in the movie 'Moulin Rouge'.  Do people still drink it?  If so, where?  Should I make this a question on it's own?  I thought to comment to see if anyone else has ever heard of it.

					@user6035379, yes, I drink it and it's lovely. I'm in the US so, after legalization in 2012, I've been able to find it in any ABC store and on lots of bars. More artisan-type brands may still need to be special ordered... Check for legality in your respective countrys

					Not an Absinth drinker, however, here in good ol' Spain we can get it (saw it in the supermarket yesterday) - so what the hell, I like a tipple or two or three etc..(hic!)...  but before I go all out and buy a bottle, what does it taste like?

					@dougal - Licorice. It's the anise and the fennel in it, usually. So, I recommend you like licorice. It's a strong flavor which is why a lot of folks use sugar... I like the taste however and don't mix sugar.

					OK I have never been into licorice, however, is it a pure licorice taste?  I am always up for new experiences but tend to lean towards not buying a bottle that stays in the cupboard forever.

					@paqogomez The Orthodox Churches and the Lutheran Churches use wine liturgically. I am sure that there are others. My original comment came from the fact that Mormons consider themselves a Christian community and they do prohibit the use of alcohol.

					You'll have to taste it, but I suspect 25ml might be a bit too much.  I would start with 15ml.  Getting the sweet/sour ration correct is a matter of taste.  I recommend using dole pineapple juice if you can get it.   Good Pineapple juice should be sweet, but have a certain bite that creates a small numbing feeling on the tongue.  It not should not be mild but also should not taste or smell over-ripe.  Also, after re-reading your post I recommend you do NOT build the drink.  Instead, pour the ingredients into a shaker with ice.  Shake until it gets to cold to hold, then strain over fresh ice.

					I see you said you don't have a shaker. Get one- they are &lt;$5 US on Amazon. The procedure you use to make the cocktail is nearly as important as the ingredients.  Bartending/ Mixology, like any art or craft, requires proper tools; and in this case, a shaker is vital.  Mixing with Ice(until the metal shaker gets extremely cold), then straining over fresh ice is the best way to bind the ingredients together and allow for the beverage to stay cold longer with less dilution(at least in the first 15 minutes after preparing the drink).  Using the proper procedure is what separates good from amazing.
