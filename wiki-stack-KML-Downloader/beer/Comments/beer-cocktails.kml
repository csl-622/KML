					Suggestion: change this to "How do I properly layer a black-and-tan"?  Since Shock Top Choc-top sounds like it's just a black and tan with their beer.

					The issue is not the accuracy of measurement but the reproducibility of production. A beer that is brewed one day at, say, 4.5% might end up at 4.6% when brewed the next week because of random variations in, for example, the temperature in the brewery or the activity of the yeast used. They're not going to get new bottle labels etc. printed for each separate batch brewed so the question isn't "how accurately can you measure the ABV of beer?" but "how tightly can you control the brewing process to end up with the ABV you were aiming for?"

					Two issues here, the first beer is taxed pretty significantly most places, as is most other alcohol. Second, I'm not sure I follow what you're getting at re: the Whiskey rebellion, that was about 150 years before modern alcohol laws would have appeared since they would have almost all been enacted post prohibition

					In Australia, too, beer laws are pretty political. The working class culture was/is closely associated with the drinking culture. Many Australian [politicians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hawke) have, historically, played on this culture and given concessions to brewers. For example, beer isn't required to have all of its ingredients listed because apparently the only ingredient is beer.

					It seems to depend on which side of the Atlantic you're on. In the UK, it's not historical at all: an ale described as "pale" will pretty much always be somewhere between straw-coloured and golden. In contrast, I've seen "pale ales" in the US that were, frankly, brown.

					Yes, your absolutely right - I didn't see it from that angle initially. That's why breweries blend their beers to help round out variations from batch to batch, and as well as hitting the right color, flavor, aroma etc, this would also help with hitting abv to within a certain tolerance.

					@Fishtoaster I'd go as far as to make it more generic. "Black and Tan" in my mind generally means Guinness and Bass, "Half and Half" may be more correct, though usually refers to Guinness and Harp. Perhaps something along the lines of "How do I get good separation when layering beers?"

					In the UK, during the 1970's &amp; 80's, consumption and domination of traditional beer was dented by the slow but inexorable rise in popularity of lager. It became fashionable, particularly among the ladies, to drink a lager &amp; lime (cordial), a quasi-beer cocktail. The men followed suit to a certain extent if only because the middling quality of lager available in this era benefited from a good dash of lime cordial. The popularity of a lager &amp; lime has waned but the consumption of straight lager has burgeoned in the last 30 years, quite possibly matching or overtaking that of beer in the UK.

					Tasting to a pattern or strategy is a great idea.  An alternative to tasting from a single region is to taste a single varietal (Riesling or Silvaner or Grüner Veltliner) from different makers or regions.  The suggestion to seek out local recommendations is excellent.  Best of all is to bring a friend and talk about what you're tasting.

					Try different Bourbons and beer (preferably porters/stouts). My favorite currently is Dragon's milk + Crown Royal. The sweetness of dark beers lends to blending with Bourbons, hence the "Bourbon Barrel Aged XYZ" beers you see. Note: I've ruined good beers and wasted good bourbon trying this.

					This is very open to opinion @GrumpyMammoth, and could get closed - everyone has their favorite beers and whiskeys for different reasons. What is "nicely" in your book is different for others, you're just going to have to try a few combos, and who says you're going to like them at all in the first place?

					Purely opinion-based, however I'd suggest checking some of your online resources. http://www.drinksmixer.com/guide/ as an example.

					Of course, sensory training would help. There are myriad beer and whiskey flavors, but understanding the various chemicals helps.
