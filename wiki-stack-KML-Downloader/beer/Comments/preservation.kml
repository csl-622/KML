					Great response! I do want to clarify that "double/imperial" does not refer to or represent the IBU (amount of bitterness) that is in a beer. Traditionally those terms imply higher gravity or alcohol.

					@matt Agree! But for the average consumer this should be and is a very subjective process. Non beer geeks hate technical jargon and how they interact with craft beer is much more visceral. If you like it drink it. Beer geeks will worry about the rest.

					If you are shopping at places where you consistently see beer on shelves after their best by date then its safe to assume that they aren't putting as much care into their stock. When i see that it starts to make my choices at that store change. I no longer trust the beer that they have will taste like it should. Forget trying to buy any IPAs as they lose their hop aromas, and will only consider beers where their age isn't as important such as higher alcohol beers, stouts, porters, brown ales, etc

					I would add an additional option: Dogfish Head's [Randall the Enamel Animal](http://www.dogfish.com/company/tangents/randall-the-enamel-animal.htm) and its cousin: [Randall Jr](http://www.dogfish.com/store/other-accessories/randall-jr.htm) which are infusion products for use with tap and bottle beer, respectively, that let you steep flavorings and aromatics in the beer as you serve them.  Because of the pressure Randall flavors pretty quickly but Randall Jr needs to sit for a bit, but they both attempt to save some carbonation.

					This is wrong, vol-% is defined by (volume of solute/volume of solution) and when you mix alcohol and water the volume of the mix is smaller than the total volume of the starting liquids. For example when you mix 50 ml of water with 50 ml of ethanol, you only get about 96,5 ml of solution. The formula is more complicated, unfortunately I do not have the answer.

					@AndrewCheong I disagree. Opened containers have a number of different variables in play, compared to closed containers. For closed containers, you're mostly worried about chemical reactions internal to the product - this is the point of the "best by" date referred to in the proposed duplicate. With opened containers, you have to worry about reactions with the air and any contaminants it may carry. Also, as "open" generally implies "partially used", you may have additional bacterial contaminants to be concerned with if the container was drank from directly.

					I drank 3 years old beer without any major change in taste. It was extra strong so I got tipsy too. Nothing happened. So, I do not think this may cause any adverse health issue. But it should be consumed within 6 months of the date of its manufacturing for best results.

					One caution on the answer about kegs. They need to stay cold until finished. You'll notice, you never pick up a new keg from the store warm. They leave the brewery cold in refrigerated trucks and are kept that way ON PURPOSE. That is because draft beer is NOT pasteurized. Bottled and canned beer is, to preserve it. That's why draft tastes much better. It is fresh beer, whereas canned beer is not. The keg can spoil much faster once it gets warm.

					@dougal4.0.0 : I can't say you're wrong or even disagree, I just tried and give OP what could possibly be the tactical aspect of such a choice from a store. Unfortunately, many shops still think they can target women using the same old "nasty"(?) tricks... I believe its completely *wrong* ( just to remain polite) but it doesn't mean one shouldn't take that into account, don't you think?
