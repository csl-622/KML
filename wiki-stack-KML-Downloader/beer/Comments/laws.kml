					I am not a lawyer, so I won't enter this as an answer, but I bet that the situation centers around having a license to _distribute_, which is probably a whole 'nother ball game than just a liquor license.

					Just re-read your question. It is a distribution licensing issue. If they got their commercial distribution license, they could sell you beer. They could also sell it in local grocery stores. It does mean people would not have to come to their bar for their beer though. Could lead to a decrease in sales.

					I think this is too broad of a question.  "Open container" itself may refer to different things, as the wikipedia article you cite seems to differentiate between "in public" and "in a vehicle".  And frankly, I think it's a little dangerous to make a country-wise consensus based on a couple of states.  I see value in the question, however, so I think this should be broken into multiple questions.

					This doesn't full answer the question.  Presuming that California law conforms to federal rules, the laws "Apply to all open alcoholic beverage containers and all alcoholic beverages, including beer, wine, and spirits that contain one-half of one percent or more of alcohol by volume" (see the linked Wikipedia article above), which would cover much "NA" beer.  But as I commented above, "open container" covers more ground than just vehicles.

					@object88 Once you get off of the California roads, you get into *individual municipalities* and even specific areas within those municipalities. I know that in my area of California, certain areas of certain cities allow any open container, other areas don't allow glass containers (whether beer or soda), etc. Limit the scope of the question to make it answerable.

					@object - Yet, I don't think there's a need for separate questions about "Open container" in public versus in a vehicle—I think one question can cover a few variants without being "too broad." I do agree that one can't generalize from states to the nation—but that is why I phrased my question, "a good estimator." I wondered if perhaps all states adhered to some federally definition of "an alcoholic beverage," in which case open container laws would indeed have similar interpretations.

					Relative degrees of corrosion of metals is a complicated topic and I decided to skip it for now.  You also have the possibility, depending on if anything from another metal makes contact with the pewter in the liquid you could get electrolytic corrosion as well.  In the end, I decided to skip all that, but some interesting experiments could be done regarding how to make beer-pewter batteries and what to use for the other electrode ;-)

					There are ways of being sneaky, but I would agree with wax eagle; the best answers are going to be around your particular state.

					I'm confused about these "in the U.S." questions. They're always gonna be closed because "it depends on the state." But then I've seen questions closed because, "if we allow this, we'd have to allow an identical question for every state (or country)." Which is it? Personally, I think it's perfectly okay to ask about a country, and for someone to answer based on several states and say something like, _"It depends on the state—for example, in New York [...] but in California [...]—so check for similar clauses in your state/municipal laws."_

					Personally, I'm of the view that once you've freeze distilled it to substantially alter the alcohol level it's no longer beer. Beer is a fermented drink; once you've applied a significant level of freeze distilling you've created something that I don't what is but it ain't a beer.

					And to embark on this route, Google "DIY Kegerator." A full-size fridge on Craigslist was only $75, and a temperature controller was about $25 IIRC. Turned out the room we were fermenting in got colder than 18 C at night in the winter, so for now I just unplug the fridge from the temp controller and plug in a desk lamp instead, which I put inside the fridge. Works like a charm.

					I'm considering closing this as primarily opinion based as it stands.   Additionally, it appears to be based on a flawed understanding of French law.  AOC wine accounts for less than half of the wine production in France.  France does allow many of the techniques you describe (such as using oak chips instead of barrels, and acids) for non-AOC, or the majority of its wine.

					The choice is you follow the laws and you can put the Appellation of the village or area you grow your grapes in, many times bringing a higher price. Don't follow the laws and you get to put Vin De France on your label which is usually a sign of plonk wine.

					It is hard to imagine this sort of thing would be freely available considering the legal implications. The provider would likely be liable for the consequences of any mistakes, and even if they were able to avoid liability then anyone who used it would need to verify its accuracy. So, in order to safely use such an API you would need to pretty much do all of the work to create it.
