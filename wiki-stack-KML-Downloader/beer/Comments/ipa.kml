					I'm not sure I have the palate or the skills to describe it, but to me many of the Belgian ales have that sort of noisy, cloudy background going on.  I've tasted beers that get desribed as "clean", and for me Belgians don't taste clean.  I think Witbier has a distinctive taste to it (sharpness?  I don't know!) and I think a lot of the Belgian ales use fruit already.  It just seemed to me OP was asking for ideas and I think the idea of a shandy that wasn't a clean pilsner and lemon, and maybe was a funky Chimay like thing and some orange would be interesting.  One opinion.

					The thing to remember with IPA's is that the whole reason they're interesting - Hops -  are highly volatile and perishable. Once you've 'aged' an IPA, it's defining characteristic is no longer prominent, and you're often left with a fairly boring beer as a result.

					Yea, pretty much. I just went though Beer Advocate's list of Imperial IPA's and cut off anything 8 or below. And I've never had it nor heard of it. I'm not a big IPA fan in general; I prefer Beligian wheats, dubbels, tripels, etc. I like beers with spicy and fruity characteristics, but without the hop overload. Well balanced is what I generally look for in a beer.

					I'm not denying it; I just never really pay attention to the IPA's cuz I'm not into them. But that list is overloaded with IPA's IMO, they should really rate the beers by style. I don't like IPA's with a few rare exceptions, so it doesn't mean much to me that it's their #1.

					This is mostly correct. Having owned a restaurant in Thailand where it's typical for a customer to stay ALL day and drink BYO whisky and still expect full service. My point is service costs and has to be taken into account. We made most of our profits on soda then ice then beer and nothing on spirits since it traditional in Thailand not to apply corkage or stop customers from byo-ing.

					A question with a much shorter list might be "What breweries are not brewing a double IPA in the NE US?". It seems like every brewery has at least one. E.G., Victory, in addition to Dirt Wolf also has Hop Wallop (8.5%ABV) and Hop Ranch (9.0%ABV). Thankfully, the tide is starting to turn, and they recently introduced Hop Ticket (4.5%ABV), a "Session IPA"

					To be fair, I think it _is_ conjecture, but somewhat necessarily so, because the question's not definitively answerable. No specific beers were mentioned in the first place, and even if they were and we found that they are indeed brewed with honey, how are we supposed to know _why_ they're brewed with honey, without interviewing Russian brewmasters (or finding some source that has)? So, while I side with @LessPop_MoreFizz that it's conjecture, I think it's a _good_ conjecture, and as good an answer as we're gonna get, considering the nature of the question.

					@audiFanatic There is no traditional russian counterpart of the Russian Imperial Stout. This style was always an English product, made for export to Russia. The high alcohol content is partly a necessity for transporting the beer through the cold baltic sea.

					Ah, my mistake. Indeed I was ignorant, believing ex-soviet and Russian were closely tied. For those of us not as culturally aware (maybe just me), would you mind clarifying what's meant by ex-soviet in your question? Also, I agree, if you're sure it's not actual honey that imparts the taste you speak of, but some aspect of a process unique to that culture, then that's objectively verifiable, unlike the intent behind brewing with honey. Though, absent such evidence, a cultural bias favoring honey notes might be a compelling theory.

					wogsland, there are a few breweries that I've seen here in the US that are making some styles that use no hops and instead use herbs (one that I tried used Lavender... and the brewer named it "Granny Panties" because the aroma reminded him of a sachet.

					I can understand that, thanks. But with brewers marketing a "triple IPA", it seems to imply that they are trying to make a distinction from a double IPA. I know that both double and triple IPAs would be judged together and are usually categorized together (like they are on Ratebeer, for example). But would would the distinction be for a brewer?

					I'm not sure American whiskey is the most common, actually - would be interesting to see the match up between whiskey, bourbon, port, brandy etc. I know for the whisky I laid down 2 years ago, whiskey wasn't even considered - port and brandy casks were much more accessible. Aside from that, have an upvote for a great answer.

					According to this [site](http://kybourbon.com/bourbon_culture-2/key_bourbon_facts), about 260,000,000 liters of bourbon were made in 2014. Whereas [831,600,000](http://www.scotch-whisky.org.uk/what-we-do/facts-figures) liters of Scotch were *exported* in 2014. Seems Scotch annually outproduces bourbon by about 3-4x.

					I used to be skeptical of tequila before I started drinking it,  now I have learned to appreciate it.  Just like any other drink you need to find what you like about, I usually take small sips and try to swish and taste it with my whole tongue, I do this with my mouth closed this prevents the over powering taste of alcohol mask the flavor once I find the notes and taste I swallow it and open my mouth a little and breath through my mouth you will taste some undertones, once you know what you like about it you begin to enjoy it better, plus you get the added bonus of looking like a BOSS!
