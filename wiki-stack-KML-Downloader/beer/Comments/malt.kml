					Drop by your local homebrew supply store and ask to smell hops, taste grains, and take a look at some ingredients. It might help your understanding to see the ingredients in person.

					That is true but not always the case, for some red wines the flavor and body will actually be fuller after a day or so after opening (this is due to the oxidization balance, this is why you let wine breath). This obviously is wine specific, so it doesn't hurt to do some research on the type of wine you are consuming. Wine requires understanding and attention to detail if you want to leverage the most from your wine drinking/tasting experience.

					Let me clarify @Paparazzi, you wouldn't want to let wine breath for much longer than a couple hours. But in the same way you let wine breath, there is a similar but much slower effect of oxidization that takes place when storing and sealing wine after opening (hence - a limit on the life of the wine after opening).

					I meant to ask about both the name and the contents. Apologies if that wasn't clear. The Irish I chatted with plus many sources on the Internet agree almost universally that the name Black and Tan is offensive within Ireland and to the Irish people. This is because the English paramilitary force you mentioned, that wore black and tan colored uniforms, committed some quite brutal acts against the Irish population. Your first link has a paragraph about how "the name Black and Tan is controversial in Ireland" and "is unable to verify how popular the Half and Half actually is in Irish pubs."

					I agree with @Paparazz. But I think mentioning brands is ok in reference to awards, official rankings and reviews. Also in terms of taste, texture, ingredients etc. Not personal preference.

					Wait, I didn't get it at 1st when paparazzi said it but since you just backed it up, are you guys saying I should not mention any brand names unless it's a probable fact? Is so let me know so I can edit.

					Pouring your partial bottle into a clean smaller bottle will reduce the ratio of oxygen and wine and extend the drinking window by a few days.   http://www.torontosun.com/2014/05/14/how-long-will-an-open-bottle-of-wine-keep
