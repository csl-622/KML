					A poorly brewed beer can lack a good head of foam. Also low alcohol beers such as Coors Light, Bud Lite come to mind as lacking a head.

					Like I said I have only used this or meringue, the taste though depends upon what type of bean has been used.  I would try with the water from something like a navy bean or other fairly benign bean, and take it from there.  It would be great if someone could do this and let us know.

					The seller is a fairly typical bottle shop, where the customers are usually frat bros looking for a cheap drink. I don't expect anything from them.

					But what do you mean by pigtail shaped corkscrew? I've never seen a corkscrew that wasn't shaped like your link.

					Go on the french wikipedia page : first of the array is straight, like a woodscrew, whereas the second is pigtailed : it doesn't have a central axis, but appears to coil around a fictive central axis. The difference is tiny, but actually matters.

					The top is made of cork, but it doesn't seem to be disintegrating. It's only a month or so old, so I'd be pretty surprised if it were. Also, the precipitate feels gritty like sand, not rubbery like cork.

					That's possible, but I'd expect char to be dark brown or black. This looks for all the world like white ash-tray sand. My main interest is what this means about the bourbon and the maker thereof. Does this mean they pay less attention than others? Or does this happen even to the best of them?

					Hmmm... not sure then. In wine it would be acid crystals or yeast or something along those lines, but in Bourbon I'm not sure what it would be other than char. It's possible there was a failure in the filtering process and some of the filter media broke loose. I've had that happen in winemaking. The other possibility is that there was some problem in the manufacturing of the glass and somehow pieces of glass ended up in your bottle. Other than that, I can't think of anything else

					Jack Daniels isn't a bourbon. It is a Tennessee Whiskey. Close to bourbon but a little different.
