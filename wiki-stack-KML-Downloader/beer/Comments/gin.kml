					That will depend on the type of martini  you are planning to make! A dry martini, a traditional martini or a specialty martini, all require different types of gin. Personal tastes will also play into this equation.

					As Ken Graham said, it highly depends on personal taste. Personally i think, that the vermouth (or other additions in specialty) plays a much bigger role to the taste than the gin.

					The alcohol that you are consuming, ethanol, is the same* in any alcoholic drink. The volume of ethanol is what is different. But, looking at your volumes, the amount of ethanol is very similar. Do you mix your vodka?

					it is probably the sugar in the sprite that is keeping you up/making you not sleep well ! :) Try drinking that volume of sprite, but without the vodka, and see how well you sleep. Then drink the same amount of whisk(e)y as you would vodka, but drink it with water.

					It is vodka Gorbatschow. (i don´t know if this counts to very cheap vodka) But you are right if i drink whisky like Jack Daniels, Jim Beam or Chivas Regal i could sleep well. Perhaps it is the vodka itself?

					@Steve S.  Great Idea, however it's fermented, and there is the issue - I can't drink cider either - which is a shame as there are some great ciders out there - including a few that would knock my socks off!  I've been experimenting with the scotch and even tried a vodka or two, but vodka is still - well vodka...  at this rate I might have to become tea total!!

					all alcohol is expensive in the UK for tax reasons. What do you mean by "cheapest"? How much are you willing to skimp on quality?also would you describe £15 per litre as cheap?

					I really think @MonicaCellio's comment about sanitisation should be first and foremost in the answer. They are asking "Can **any** mistake in the brewing process...". The one difference I found between mead brewing and other brewing is you don't boil the mix so contamination is slightly more likely. Even with bad sanitisation from what I can tell making something toxic is unlikely because the alcohol kills most things, you will just create something undrinkable. I've heard mead has a bad reputation, but I'm not sure why.

					This question in it's current format isn't really a good fit for the Stack Exchange format. Broad suggestions are primarily opinion based, but the question could be re-worded to look for drinks that are most commonly drunk in the winter
