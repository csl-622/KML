					Non-answer, opinion-based: Stouts seem to be the thing in the "dark" beer category, esp. your flavored and imperial stouts, since a base stout is just a little bit bigger than a porter.  I would guess that porters are considered "pedestrian", or perhaps just retreading the stout category.  That said, there are some great porters out there, so don't give up on them!  :)

					Since there's no real difference between stouts and porters, do you know if this bartender was trying to say that this style of beer does not do well, or that it's something about the name "porter" itself? (My one friend thought that all porters tasted like coffee for a long time, because he'd only ever had coffee porters.)

					IMHO, there's quite a difference between stout and porter. A Stout is usually fairly smooth, sweet and roasty, chocolatey, even vanilla. A porter is usually a more acrid bitterness, less sweetness - more focus on the roasted qualities without the sweetness.

					@mdma: I agree with  that stouts and porters are different, but not 100% with your flavor assessment. A stout is brewed with roasted barley, and that roast is the signature flavor of a stout (dry, foreign or imperial). A milk stout will have lactose added, and tends to be sweeter. Porters may include roasted barley but usually have other dark malts, such as chocolate, black barley, black patent, etc. I find they are generally more chocolately and often sweeter than a stout, but may be more acrid than a stout if the black patent is overdone.

					@object88: A dry stout is lighter than a brown porter (the two lightest types of stout and porter) in body and alcohol. Most people are surprised to find out that Guinness draft is actually a light beer.

					Here here!  Also, your body goes through electrolytes much slower than it goes through water, so you probably don't need to actually replenish them.  Unless you're exercising for more than an hour, you can just drink regular water with no added electrolytes.

					This is exactly correct - I was just about to write this until I saw your answer. It's not about the tongue but about the aromatics. You can get a similar sensation by holding the beer in your mouth while breathing in at the same time, pulling air over the beer. But it's far easier, and less noisy to just swallow it!

					I hedged my answer a bit because I haven't been involved with that many beer tastings.  Although I couldn't find any resources advocating spitting, I wasn't confident enough to rule out the idea that some judge somewhere does it.

					[This guy][1] has a LOT of reviews on his YouTube channel. In America - I have found that top tier doesn't always mean "better." Price normally denotes a rarity (think limited release, 1500 bottles ever) time/effort in releasing. Pappy Van Winkle 23yr takes 23 years of care to make and they have to make ~50 gallons to yield 3... Oddly, it retails for ~$120 but you'll normally see it priced closer to $2000.

					@Altbier - I read the wikis and other articles - I only *posted* the first sentences from each. Was looking for further substantial (and helpful, mind you) input... Also, while I already know the differences, I felt it'd be a good question to have up on the board for anyone who might be curious... At least 6 community members so far (possibly including yourself?) would agree with me.
