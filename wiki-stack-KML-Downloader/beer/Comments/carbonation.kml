					@cdspace how so? The other question is about *mitigating* extreme carbonation. This question asks about whether that quality is common in the product of a particular brewery.

					Indeed a duplicate. That's what happens when you drink and post. As @JasonMcLaughlin points out, cask conditioned beers do not force carbonation, and the Wells Banana Bread Beer is indeed a "draught seasonal cask beer."

					Do breweries have to register, then?  If so, the instructions they're given might contain clues.  Does the PLCB let in anybody who pays a fixed fee, or is there a vetting process, or what?  This is what I'm trying to figure out.

					Boiling might not be chemically necessary for mead, but in my experience it's pretty common -- you boil the honey and water and skim the crud before fermenting.

					This question is probably better suited to the dedicated homebrew.SE, but since it'll be a duplicate there I'll answer.  Andrew Cheong may roll in here at some point and migrate you as well.  Homebrewing-related questions ARE allowed here, but they should be of interest to regular beer drinkers as well, the more technical the question is, the more likely it is to be appropriate for homebrew.SE.  Thanks!

					Thanks for helping out @Sloloem. Yup, indeed homebrewing questions are allowed here. I'll only migrate if I think a question isn't able to be fully answered here. (Yesterday I migrated [a question](http://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/15280/how-do-i-limit-the-amount-of-sediment-in-bottles), but only by mistake. I thought it had no answers at all, not realizing I was in the reviews page. Normally I wouldn't have done that; there was no way for me to undo.)

					You could look up the partial pressure of COâ‚‚ in the beer at that temp to compare.  Come on, don't expect you to subscript but elements are upper case.  What is your basis for at least 1/2 at original carbonation?  Why are you using a mix on a non-nitro beer?

					Why limit to local?   We don't even know your local.   Just open pour in glass and leave in fridge.  Brewing produces CO2 so not going to get no.

					Welcome to Stack Exchange! That's a good answer but, next time let us know how you know something. We especially like links and references, you can see Silent-Bob up there included both. Keep answering questions and checking out the site, you'll fit in in no time at all.

					There's a good chance this question will get closed by admin if it isn't rephrased. The US is large.... Paparazzi is right, we don't know where you are. Why do you want low carbonation beers? Why do they have to be local? There are styles of beer that have naturally lower carbonation, if you expand the scope of your question and ask in general "What types of beer have lower or no carbonation and why?" you'll for sure get good answers. Then you can see which local breweries make those styles. Just trying to help, hope you find what you're looking for. Cheers.

					What about Amarone and Vin Santo? [Here](http://www.winespectator.com/webfeature/show/id/44663) I read that in Rome "the grapes were harvested late and, like many ancient wines, left to dry before being fermented to 15 or 16 percent alcoholâ€”though the Romans cut their wines with water when drinking. The Vin Santo and Amarone we drink today are made much the same way."

					In any case, there a few more candidates: *Caecubum Bianco*, *Abbuoto* and *Falanghina Bocca Bianca* might be produced from the same grapes as was falernian wine, if these weren't destroyed (and we don't know); also, *Falerno del Massico bianco* and *Falerno del Massico rosso* are produced in the same area as falernian wine. Finally, *Caecubum rosso* is primarily made with *uva serpe*, a grape variety already mentioned by Columella (it was called *Dracontion*).
