					Hello, you're welcome to add EAN codes - all the code (tooling), database schema and datasets is open and public domain. For the database tables / schema, see [schema.rb](https://github.com/beerkit/beer.db.models/blob/master/lib/beerdb/schema.rb) -- as an alternative you can also use "plain" SQL of course.

					It is all a matter of preference.  If you want to be fun, you could use a straw and drink the bottom beer first.  The layered look is done as much for aesthetics as anything else.  I tip them to my mouth as usual, maybe sometimes trying to take care not to disturb it too much, but it really starts to mix once you've brought it to your mouth and back.  Check out [this page](http://www.theperfectblackandtan.com/blog/category/Triple%20layer) for some excellent examples of layered beers (even 3 layers).

					All I can say is that wine is widespread through the Eastern Orthodox regions. I don't think there is any special wines they drink. It might depend on where you are. Probably red wine since it's used in rituals to replace the "blood of Christ". I dated a woman who was Eastern Orthodoxed from Slovenia originally and I don't think they cared as long as it was decent red wine.

					@Steve S.  Great Idea, however it's fermented, and there is the issue - I can't drink cider either - which is a shame as there are some great ciders out there - including a few that would knock my socks off!  I've been experimenting with the scotch and even tried a vodka or two, but vodka is still - well vodka...  at this rate I might have to become tea total!!

On the whole though, mr dougal can drink anything except red wine.  It's dougal who can't drink the other stuff, so I want us both to enjoy something together and not have to resort to two different things, as is normal.

However, under suggestion of this [Italian site](http://www.saporiacasatua.com/prodotto/cacio-fiore/) I used a Gasperini and I appreciated the result. Though, I would like to go for a liquorous wine now, which will be even better, in my opinion. Do you have some in mind?

					@David - He's experienced, and I'm a super-taster with a notoriously keen nose.  I don't know if the claim was explicitly "oak."  I wouldn't claim to know the wood specie, but it was definitely an "aging barrel wood" nose.  Keep in mind I had a glass with the same wine in it, so we were able to pick out the difference imparted by the glass.  If both glasses had been similarly tainted, I would have just assumed it was part of the wine's profile.  He might have known enough to alert on the fact that the particular wine he chose should not have a strong wood component.

					Then my bet would be that it was a previously used glass that wasn't washed properly and had some kind of residue (possibly whisky). I propose an experiment (and I'll try it myself in the coming days): put a half-measure of whisky in a wine glass, swirl, empty (drink). Leave to dry overnight, pour in a reasonably big &amp; powerful red... smell. In any case I would be shocked if this was intentional. To pick a small nit, "supertasters" aren't necessarily "better" tasters -- that's almost entirely down to olfaction and training. We just are capable of detecting a couple chemicals others can't.

					@David: You're right of course about the supertasting.  I don't know how to qualify my olfactory acuity (except perhaps as "notoriously keen" ;)  I like the experiment idea, and I suspect it will produce the effect we observed (especially with a quarter-cask Laphroaig I have on hand).  But keep in mind this was a red wine glass at a fine restaurant: Is it conceivable they would be serving whiskey neat in such a glass?

					If it was strongly oaky, a better bet might be a Bourbon (virgin cask aging). There are many ways it could end up in a "wrong" glass: by customer request, or it could be used as a temporary vessel, or a staff member's surreptitious quaff with whatever was on hand. Who knows.

					If nobody answers this, I'll flesh this out as an answer tomorrow... But essentially once you eliminate the rotgut at the bottom end, price and "quality" (in the sense we would normally understand it) are pretty much uncorrelated, as long as you are tasting blind (and haven't been primed psychologically). There are lots of relevant studies in the literature.

					I get the tulip glass thing, but as a big whisky drinker I don't like them, too hard to drink from. I usually use a small, wide-rimmed glass somewhere between a shot glass and a tumbler, enough to hold an ounce or two of neat liquor, and lightweight. Also don't usually dilute my whisky, given I should experiment a bit more with that.

					@mcraen I'm a pretty strong proponent of enjoying what you enjoy in whatever way gives you the maximum pleasure, so if partaking of larger sips of cask strength from a wider-mouth glass is what does it for you, you should by all means keep doing that! I tried to hedge a little ("if you are drinking it to taste it" preface to my exhortation not to skip step 5) and suggestion that you should really be experimenting... it should be both fun and a learning experience, and hopefully deliciously pleasurable too :)

					I've done a small bit of researching on whisky dilution and am still unconvinced that it 'improves' the experience, but rather just 'changes' the experience. I'd love to get a definitive answer on the effect. I suspect the practice has arisen from people who drink sub-par whisky and like masking the harshness a bit, with water and/or ice. For me, I have no problem with the harshness of any liquor so usually just go full strength.

					Regarding that comment on red wines, so as to have enough richness to take on the flavor of haggis - I would point out that there are also some whites that will do the trick, though not as common. E.g. Gewürztraminer is a favorite of mine for similar types of food.

					This is a good and appreciated answer, although it doesn't directly address the question. Even if wines have a wide range in production quality, the question is more about the range of the final product. If the best of the best wines are only marginally more enjoyable than mediocre ones, then the low threshold still exists.

					Yep. I suspected that the process is difficult and hard to do objectively. Although there's got to be some, any process at all that wine experts use to decide on a wine based on quality. When I go into a wine shop I feel totally blind and would like to change that, to any degree. If it's not really doable at all, I'd like to know that too!

					The question you set appealled for a closed answer, I don't know how to make a useful one ;) I don't mean you are wrong in your assumption, but a diminutive threshold can be found in nearly every product or service, notwithstandig Vleben Good. Price can tend to mathematical infinity, while product or service can only tend to the maximum human abilities (for wine, sensoral capacity and knowledge which are limited by genetics and lifespan) : the diminutive threshold is the widening gap between both and won't widen the same for two given people. Focusing in value is IMHO more relevant than price.

					I hate plastic corks. Wineries are lazy in using them. They should be using screwcaps instead, which are recyclable. Plastic corks are hard to insert into a bottle and hard to remove. They have made some progress with plastic corks, but they still suck. Having said that, I think the claim that 10% of wines are tainted with TCA is way too high. In my own winery, I thought it was around 2% but then we used high end corks.

					Yes, but they are way more expensive and it gets hotter in the Alsace than on the Rhine river (well technically both are on the Rhine) mostly giving a more full bodied Riesling than the German ones. These are generalities as I'm sure you can find some German ones that match the Alsatian ones in warmer years.

					I lived on the Rhine river for 3 years so I know my German Rieslings quite well, thank you very much, but IMNSHO I think you need more power than what German rieslings can give you. The Alsace is warmer and drier than most of the Riesling growing territory in Germany. Grand Cru Alsatian Rieslings especially give you more "stuff".

					NOMACORC is one of the standard plastic corks out in the market. They have several different products from plonk wine to high end corks that transmit minute amounts of oxygen to slowly age the wine and much easier to pull out of the bottle. The quotes below about plastic corks look like talking points from the natural cork industry. Having said that, I just think plastic corks are a waste. Go to screw caps if are you are going to bottle wine on the cheap

					This really is the best answer. People don't need to have their minds changed. Sometimes, you'll find that changing someone's mind leads to them having a resentment for you for convincing them to break with their beliefs. I have a friend that won't drink because four of their close friends were killed by drunk drivers. They might like it; but, is more of a way to remember them.

					It also depends on the kind of whisky. There are kinds that benefit greatly from adding water, and there are those that don't. The strongest I ever had (59% abv) insisted on being drank pure. Ah, the intensity! But with water added, it tasted just... ordinary. As if it was just any old whisky. Of course all this is just my personal subjectivity, but it shows it does pay to experiment.

					I'm considering closing this as primarily opinion based as it stands.   Additionally, it appears to be based on a flawed understanding of French law.  AOC wine accounts for less than half of the wine production in France.  France does allow many of the techniques you describe (such as using oak chips instead of barrels, and acids) for non-AOC, or the majority of its wine.

					The choice is you follow the laws and you can put the Appellation of the village or area you grow your grapes in, many times bringing a higher price. Don't follow the laws and you get to put Vin De France on your label which is usually a sign of plonk wine.

					@Phillipp people just trying to monetize their intellectual property. Looks like wine.com is going out of business. I know that on some sites like Cellar Tracker you can see scores but the API is mainly for the bottles in your cellar. When I was selling wine, I used to download scores from Wine Spectator, but it was a manual process. I think the best thing you can do is some type of screen scraping program. Sorry but in my brief search of the internet it looks like there is nothing and it's something that you simply won't find for free.

					Oh, I'm definitetly not a database professional.  I just know enough to be dangerous (to myself).  I agree that if I use the cloud, the problem goes away.  The whole challenge/puzzle is how to do it without a cloud.  You are of the opinion that the only solution is a custom one that I create myself.  My current solution is a custom one, and it isn't good enough.  As I am not a developer, unless I am in a position to abandon my current life and transform myself, a custom solution doesn't cut it. It may be the case that there is no solution, and I would find that to be an acceptable answer.

					@EricShain I have tried Googling it many times and the general theme is "Not currently available". On the rare occasion when someone *appears* to have it, they want around £10 per bottle. Let's put that in context; about a year ago a UK budget supermarket chain suddenly stocked it and I bought 15 bottles for £3.36 each. If you've seen somewhere that I can get it for, say, less than £7.50/bottle, can you please post a link?

					@EricShain It's very interesting reading that site, many of those brands; McGuigan, Wolf Blass, Hardys, these are very big sellers in the UK, all of the major supermarkets will stock their wines, but I can only assume that "GTR" is not really favoured by the British for some reason so they don't bother to import this particular variety. Actually Gewurztraminer itself is relatively rare in supermarkets but it is at least available if I look around. Riesling is pretty common.

					You might try requesting a specific wine at your favorite wine store. If they already carry a brand it should be feasible. Better specialty wine shops in the US sometimes try to help out their good customers. Otherwise you could contact the wine brands themselves. They may be able to point you to a UK reseller.

					@eric shain, I've tried every avenue I can think of. Rosemount's web site allowed me to order it for shipment from Australia to the UK; total price about £30/bottle. Hardys told me about the one retailer that imports it into the UK and I had to order it through them for a few years. They would not stock it due to lack of demand. They can no longer obtain it. Basically, people who stock Hardys wines cannot obtain GTR in the UK. I haven't seen Rosemount's version for about 10 years. M&amp;S have recently stocked another brand, but in limited supply for £9.50/bottle.

					I don't follow your point 3. Whatever grape juice you start with, making a more alcoholic wine will remove more sugar. If the market is demanding sweet wines, that would pressure towards lower alcohol levels. And what does that have to do with watering down the juice, anyway?

					What happens when you get to the upper echelons of natural fermentation, around 17-18% ABV the fermentations usually aren't completed and leave some sweetness behind. This is a stylistic thing. I know guys that purposely leave their fruit on the vine to raisin so it gives them that sweet flavor in their wine. This comes at a cost since the grapes are over ripe. Therefore, there is a lot of watering down to get them below a level of sweetness to complete fermentation. Otherwise they have a wine that is 17+% ABV and sweet.

					A comment on your IPAs: If you need one more way to predict whether you'll like an IPA, look at the type of hops, not just the IBU level. Different varieties of hops have significantly different aromas and flavors. Not all bottled beers will tell you the varieties of hops they use, but most brewpubs and websites will tell you.

					When you say filtering can remove a lot of flavor is simply false unless they go to sub-micron filter to keep it sterile. Most beer is filtered at 5 microns on stripping out proteins and some yeast. Hop flavors are not stripped out. Although the yeast and proteins do have flavor in them, their flavoring components are water and alcohol soluble and are left behind.

					Yes. There is Camellia Sinensis and then there is 'tea' defined as a hot steeped drink. In theory, anything can be a tea by the second definition, but whether it's palatable or has any pleasing affects is another thing altogether. I'd guess hops might offer some sedative qualities, but the fact that it isn't a commonly used 'tea' suggests to me that it's probably better left to beer.

					I've heard from some brewing enthusiasts that boiling water is not suitable for making a "tea" from grains, but 60-65°C water is just right. I haven't had a chance to experiment with it myself yet, but I will try soon. I just wonder why high temperature is bad, and why such a low temperature was recommended (65°C is also very appropriate for the smoothest green teas).

					Without knowing specific chemistry I'd assume elements of different teas/coffee/whatever break-down at different temperatures. Which means that grains likely have a maximal temperature to become 'activated' but not break down completely.

					Are you eating when you are drinking these wines? That can have a profound impact on the flavors. Also, it could be the way the glasses are cleaned. What are you used to drinking for red wines. I am a lover of Austrian reds and they are pretty high on the fruit scale and low on the oak.

					Grapes are roughly 16% sugar, and of course they work. Highly doubt limes or cucumbers at &lt;2% will work without first adding external sugar and for limes correcting acidity. Also, good luck with avocado, where even if you can get a "juice", contains basically no sugar to ferment.

					We use apples without any additions and they are pretty low sugar. They just happen to have a high level of Malic acid. The question is can all fruits be turned into wine and of course the technical answer is no. But let's assume the OP meant your typical fruit at the grocery store. Then yes, most can with the addition of sugar and acid. Only apples and grapes pretty much have everything needed to make an alcohol beverage without cooking or additions.

					Question literally says "*all* fruit". In any case, that point was tangential, as is clearly implied by "This is completely discounting..." verbiage in the last paragraph. If you want to stop after the first two paragraphs, fine... the answer is still "no". No issue with your answer to the "why are grapes best" question.

					What do you mean by "wine", and what do you mean by "all fruit"? You can, of course, dissolve sugar in water and ferment that (the Finns call this *kilju*), flavoring it with whatever juice you want. If you mean fermenting the pure juice, lots of fruits won't work because they don't have enough sugar.

					@Ken Graham you can't just change the nature of the question. The OP said "all fruit" not "all edible fruit". Of course you can make wine from just about anything, toxic or inedible with some water and sugar. That brings up the question of what is "wine" but that's a different question!
