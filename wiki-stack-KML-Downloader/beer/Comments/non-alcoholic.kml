					I think this is too broad of a question.  "Open container" itself may refer to different things, as the wikipedia article you cite seems to differentiate between "in public" and "in a vehicle".  And frankly, I think it's a little dangerous to make a country-wise consensus based on a couple of states.  I see value in the question, however, so I think this should be broken into multiple questions.

					This doesn't full answer the question.  Presuming that California law conforms to federal rules, the laws "Apply to all open alcoholic beverage containers and all alcoholic beverages, including beer, wine, and spirits that contain one-half of one percent or more of alcohol by volume" (see the linked Wikipedia article above), which would cover much "NA" beer.  But as I commented above, "open container" covers more ground than just vehicles.

					@object88 Once you get off of the California roads, you get into *individual municipalities* and even specific areas within those municipalities. I know that in my area of California, certain areas of certain cities allow any open container, other areas don't allow glass containers (whether beer or soda), etc. Limit the scope of the question to make it answerable.

					@object - Yet, I don't think there's a need for separate questions about "Open container" in public versus in a vehicle—I think one question can cover a few variants without being "too broad." I do agree that one can't generalize from states to the nation—but that is why I phrased my question, "a good estimator." I wondered if perhaps all states adhered to some federally definition of "an alcoholic beverage," in which case open container laws would indeed have similar interpretations.

					It was mostly in jest, though I really do drink IPAs at many meals, but I'm more likely to cook up some stir fry or make a pizza than a proper meal. In seriousness, with something like steak and potatoes, I'd probably go with a porter.

					Lol @ density comment. Ok, yeah we're on the same page then. The CO2 / N2 explanation does seem more compelling than a purely psychological one. When I get a chance I'll go buy both a CO2 and a N2 version of my favorite stout and see if I can add some anecdotal evidence.

					Carbon dioxide dissolves in the watery liquid and imparts a sour taste.  This is quite noticeable if you ever brew uncarbonated beer, which has a very different flavor profile.

					Relative degrees of corrosion of metals is a complicated topic and I decided to skip it for now.  You also have the possibility, depending on if anything from another metal makes contact with the pewter in the liquid you could get electrolytic corrosion as well.  In the end, I decided to skip all that, but some interesting experiments could be done regarding how to make beer-pewter batteries and what to use for the other electrode ;-)

					Hi!  This question is a bit rough around the edges, we could use a bit more for discussion here.  Are you looking for advice on how to avoid a hangover, or how to avoid being too drunk?  If so, rephrase the question for one of the more open-ended variations.

					When I was about 15, I downed half a bottle of alcohol and then ate a loaf of bread and never got drunk. I told someone a few weeks ago and they said I was no way because eating bread to get sober was a myth. I'm seriously confused now? Wondering if I did get drunk but dont remember. But I remember I was with friends who questioned why I wasn't drunk after cheering me on to down the bottle; so I doubt it. People can be so weird.

					I don’t know where you live, but what you claim was not the case in Germany for a long time. There were very few non-alcoholic pilsner’s until a couple of years ago (Clausthaler was the only big brand), but there was malt beer and different non-alcoholic wheat beers (Erdinger, Franziskaner...).
					Nowadays, most big brands offer non-alcoholic variants of their beers, and since in Germany pilsner is the most common type of beer, there’s a large variety of non-alcoholic pilsners to be found in supermarkets.

					You make the statement about cancer risk as though it is a simple fact. It isn't. There is a fair amount of data that suggests that moderate wine drinking (especially red wine) can actually be good for your heart and perhaps even be protective for cancer. Certainly abusing alcohol has all sorts of problems, but lets not assume they apply universally to modest drinking.
