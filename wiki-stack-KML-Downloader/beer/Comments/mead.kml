					Thanks for the answer. Do they generally have the sour taste of vinegar or does the vinegar's characterisitc taste rather vanish under sweetness? Or is it a case-by-case difference?

					Hard to say, but you probably introduced some contamination into the skunking bottles somehow. Were you reusing bottles from something else? Did an entire run go bad or just certain bottles out of the batch? Another thought, were the bad bottles clear so they would transmit light? How are they stored (temp changes in the room)? Corked bottle, grolsch, bottle cap? I've been pretty loosey goosey with my mead so far and not experienced any skunking (yet) though most of mine have been like yours, high alcohol content and sweetness, which might be masking some underlying flavors.

					@JasonK thanks for the comment; I've edited in some clarifications.  I also might have been using the word "skunking" incorrectly (changed now); I'm not talking about batches that went wrong from the start, but about different "decay times", so to speak.

					@MonicaCellio Ah, I get you now. You are saying that with some batches you prefer the taste early on, but they seem to get less appealing as they age, while others do not? Are there dryer meads that you do like? Perhaps you just like the sweeter ones. Are they all still (non-carbonated)? Another thought is that you may be aerating some batches during bottling, or your bottle caps are not sealed properly, which can negatively affect the taste. But I think the sweeter meads are just covering up slight off-flavors that the dryer meads don't. Consistency takes lots of practice!

					@JasonK thanks, and please feel free to make an edit if different language would have made this clearer.  While I do like sweeter meads more than drier ones I don't *think* I'm just tasting a sweet-versus-dry thing; there's something about some batches that feels "off", as distinct from "too dry for my taste", and I'm trying to figure out how to know how quickly I should drink any given mead to avoid getting there.

					@MonicaCellio I've added the rest of my thoughts as an answer since it is long. May not help, but might help someone else down the road. Doesn't seem to be a very active mead community here (I think this is the only question with a [mead] tag) so you may have better luck with another forum.

					Huh, the recipe doesn't mention boiling at all.  It sounds like this recipe is the mead analogue of cold-brew coffee.  Unless Columella just left that part out as obvious, which sometimes happens in pre-modern recipes.

					@Monica: From Steve's comments, I would infer that they didn't boil water and honey together because they actually _had to use_ honey's yeast, and boiling would kill it. Am I wrong?
