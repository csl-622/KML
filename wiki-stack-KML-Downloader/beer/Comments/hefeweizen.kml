					I ran a search over on [RateBeer.com](http://www.ratebeer.com/search.php) for 'coriander' and got quite a few results. Unfortunately, hefeweizen doesn't show up as a searchable style on their advanced search, but you can probably scan the list of coriander beers quickly.

					Yes, shandy is great. I've never tried it fresh yet; I don't have any juice nor wheat beer at the moment, but when I get some I will give it a shot. I have a few bottles of Schofferhoffer Grapefruit Shandy left though. I tried it in Epcot while I was in Disney World a few months ago and I just had to get more

					@AvnerShahar-Kashtan Hey, that's interesting. I can search for "German Hefeweizen" as a type (the "Beer Style" dropdown), but do not see where I can enter the term "coriander"? Is there any textbox where I can enter a term/tag?
