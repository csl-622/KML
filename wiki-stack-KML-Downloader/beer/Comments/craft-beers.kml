					I was a long time ago now, but I think it was darker.  Pretty sure it wasn't on the sour end, as I didn't like most beer when I was "new to beer" and I still don't like IPA style beer ( though I'll drink it occasionally ).  I want to say it was sweeter, but not sure.  Mostly just looking for things to try from that area.

					This will not work after the beer is fermented. You cannot read directly the sugar content after you ferment without a special scale and sometimes that doesn't work all that well for beer because of the unfermentable sugars.

					While I definitely get where you're coming from and think that your second point (about commercial breweries and the chemicals used) I'm a bit hesitant about the initial point about bread.  With bread you apply heat post-fermentation.  Any microorganisms in the dough should be killed during this process and at the end you're left with a product that is pretty definitively just food.  With beer, especially homebrew, heat is applied prior to fermentation.  Especially for bottle-conditioned beer, there is live yeast (and possibly other microorganisms) that you are ingesting along with the beer.

					Experience tells us that ingesting these microorganisms is safe, of course, but that's not necessarily obvious or to be taken for granted.  Especially when you consider that many breweries filter out the yeast before packaging, a step that is generally impractical on a homebrew scale but may add an additional sense of comfort for some consumers.

					Thank you for sharing this answer.  I'm also assuming that the question is about starting from the finished product, so you can't just take gravities before and after fermentation.  I hadn't realized that it was easier for wine than for beer, but now that you've explained it, that makes sense.

This has given me the most insight of all the answers as to, not only what I need to be doing in order to follow a safe brewing process, but how I can brew better beer and why I should brew better beer.

					Rereading I think I understand: beer left after distilling. Less volatile acids would not boil off in the still and would remain in the leftover liquid, I save some (how much?) and add it to the wash from the next batch prior to adding yeast and fermenting?

					The term "wash" is not used in bourbon AFAIK. Some distilleries add the spent beer (also called backset, setback, or sour mash) to the mash cooker, and some add it to the fermentor after cooking. You can try to go with a percentage, or aim for a specific pH. A message board I found through google suggested 20%-25%. And, yes, spent beer is the leftovers from distillation with the solids removed. In bourbon, the solids remain in the beer and go through the still.

					OK, this is in alignment with my thinking. What I call "wash" is the cooked liquid (grain solids strained out) that is cooled, fermented, then distilled. I call it "mash" after fermentation. I have no idea if my terminology is correct. So if I want to end up with a sour-mash bourbon style product, I will leave the grain solids in and add some "setback" before fermenting. Thanks for all the info., much appreciated!

					@Richard Refrigeration makes it unlikely because yeast generally likes temperatures close to room temperature.  Most yeast will go dormant as you get into refrigeration temperatures.  As for the Crabtree effect, I'm no microbiologist but I believe the effect is generally fairly small (say, less than 1% ABV).  I'm also not sure if it would even happen in an environment that already contains alcohol (like wine).  It's shouldn't be increasing your ABV in any noticeable way though.

					I just spent a week in BC skiing recently and found many decent craft beers that were on par with the beers I find around Seattle. At least from my point of view there was no difference. They were fond of different styles of beer, favoring British styles but I could find whatever I wanted at the BC liquor stores and on tap.

					True. That's why I didn't use my regular kitchen fridge/freezer. I bought a separate one. As a side benefit, you can install tap handles in the door and put kegs in it to serve draft beer at the perfect temperature at home.

					Yea I guess this is one of those things that would be hard to generalize, because both the U.S. and Canada are large places. But at least when I've visited Michigan and Florida, the beer situation seems to be a bit better than in Ontario.

					It could be here on the west coast, including BC, we have had a very long tradition of quality craft beer. Liquor laws in BC I think are more liberal than Ontario. I've heard stories about how hard it is to work with the OLCB.

					It's the other way around. I only know this practice in São Paulo and above, and the ones who made it popular in São Paulo were the northern people. I'm talking about "quermesse" and "festa junina" where people dress like rednecks (caipira) , dance "quadrilha" and drink hot wine, called "quentão"

					When you say filtering can remove a lot of flavor is simply false unless they go to sub-micron filter to keep it sterile. Most beer is filtered at 5 microns on stripping out proteins and some yeast. Hop flavors are not stripped out. Although the yeast and proteins do have flavor in them, their flavoring components are water and alcohol soluble and are left behind.

					@farmersteve - Yes, you're right.  A lot of macro lagers (most?) are sterile filtered to remove all yeast and bacteria for shelf-stability (and probably other reasons).

					Yes. There is Camellia Sinensis and then there is 'tea' defined as a hot steeped drink. In theory, anything can be a tea by the second definition, but whether it's palatable or has any pleasing affects is another thing altogether. I'd guess hops might offer some sedative qualities, but the fact that it isn't a commonly used 'tea' suggests to me that it's probably better left to beer.

					I've heard from some brewing enthusiasts that boiling water is not suitable for making a "tea" from grains, but 60-65°C water is just right. I haven't had a chance to experiment with it myself yet, but I will try soon. I just wonder why high temperature is bad, and why such a low temperature was recommended (65°C is also very appropriate for the smoothest green teas).

					Without knowing specific chemistry I'd assume elements of different teas/coffee/whatever break-down at different temperatures. Which means that grains likely have a maximal temperature to become 'activated' but not break down completely.

					I'm afraid this is false. The vikings had words for yeast (kveykur) and there's even a passage in the saga that talks about a brewer adding yeast to the beer, but it wouldn't ferment (probably stored too long) "so that all their work was in vain". They definitely knew about yeast.
