					Do you have any links that back up your claim that CO2 causes alcohol to go to your head faster? Also, you may want to consider removing your last paragraph; you're giving advice that's based solely on opinion, and it's irrelevant to the question. (And also wrong: when I go out, I often have a pre-dinner drink with a strong alcohol, then switch to beer or wine later in the evening, with no ill effects or regret.)

					As a consumer though, you hardly have a choice in the matter -  and breweries will often make the choice for a variety of reasons that often have nothing to do with the effect on the product, ranging from cost to aesthetics to market research. This is maybe a good question for the specific case of growlers, where the choice is between swing-top and twist, but for standard bottles, it doesn't feel like a question that belongs here.

					I think it's definitely relevant to consumer beers; depending on the answer, it could influence what kind of beer (or at least from what manufacturer) I purchase. For example, if the answer had said "twist tops are really bad" then I'd probably avoid buying them in the future.

					@Greg No, the negative voter, (who, I will add, finds grousing about downvotes sans comments to be the single most offensive thing *anyone* can do on SE short of posting flat out hate speech), voted down the answer because he felt that it wasn't a very good answer, and didn't do a particularly good job of articulating what makes the "Winter Warmer"/"Christmas Ale" style unique. That said, the pejorative use of the 'r-word' has managed to rile me up even more than your complaining about my downvote, so good job!

					I'm confused. Your opening paragraph is completely unsupported by the rest of your post. I'd posit that temperature changes do *not* spoil beer, but you start out saying it does...  and then go on to talk about how *light* affects beer. I think that first paragraph may be *wrong,* but there's little in the rest of the text to say so one way or the other.

					Prevent entirely? Probably not - but you wouldn't *want* that either, @Monica. In a "catastrophic failure" scenario, popping a cap is preferable to breaking the bottle itself. Under normal conditions, the fermentation produces *juust* enough pressure to give the wine/beer a nice sparkling carbonation and the cap a satisfying "pop" - the over-cap would need only to keep it in place long enough for you to enjoy it.

					That's not draft. That's what I say at the end - gravity fed from the cask/barrel is not draught. (I've expanded to clarify what I mean.) Serving directly from the cask was how they did it before draught beer came along.

					To expand on 4 a little, keg pressure can also be a little inconsistent at times resulting in almost pure foam (from a fresh keg), or almost no foam (from a keg that has been tapped for a day). This is especially evident when a hand pump tap is used as opposed to a pressure regulator (although even in pubs you will notice they let the tap run a bit when a keg is freshly tapped).

					Also the quantity of hops has a bearing since the foam are formed from complexes of proteins and polyphenols from the hops. (If you observe the foam just after it is poured you'll see it changes slightly - gets more of a waxy sheen and becomes more rigid.)

					-1 It isn't true that draught means served from a cask or keg. The beers before draught came about were also served from a cask, but they were simply served under gravity. Draught is an old term for "drawn" that the beer is somehow drawn from the cask, such as with a hand pump. Nowadays, it's either via a beer engine or CO2 pressure.

					See my comments above, 1.015 OG wouldn't give the ABV listed. It's probably in degrees Plato , which fits more closely to the numbers. Good try, but a bit off on the explanation

					Nice to add some historical perspective to this.  Nitro is definitely a new method that attempts to make keg poured or bottled beer more like cask pulled beer, which I'm surprised wasn't in this question already.  Though your answer is a bit of a ramble-y wall of text, if you've got the time it would look amazing with some formatting.

					I'm sorry, but this is all wrong. Brewers were well aware of yeast centuries before Pasteur. A Norwegian yeast log, an implement used to preserve the yeast between brewings, has the year 1638 carved into it. In Sweden, Olaus Magnus's recipe from 1555 mentions yeast, etc. There are even hints that brewers knew about yeast in Roman times. Very likely ancient beers were not spontaneously fermented, for a whole number of reasons.

					A lot of styles, especially geographically named styles draw their defining character from what's available where and when they're brewed.  Pilsners are defined by the use of Czech hops and soft water, which is what's available in Pilzen where the style originated.  Another one is Oktoberfest beer, which is sometimes called Marzen.  Brewing between April &amp; September was against the law (summer heat/bacteria would make bad beer), so they brewed strong, hoppy beer in March and kept it cellared until lighter beers ran out, cracked it in late summer, and finished it off at Oktoberfest.

					I hate plastic corks. Wineries are lazy in using them. They should be using screwcaps instead, which are recyclable. Plastic corks are hard to insert into a bottle and hard to remove. They have made some progress with plastic corks, but they still suck. Having said that, I think the claim that 10% of wines are tainted with TCA is way too high. In my own winery, I thought it was around 2% but then we used high end corks.

					Yes, but they are way more expensive and it gets hotter in the Alsace than on the Rhine river (well technically both are on the Rhine) mostly giving a more full bodied Riesling than the German ones. These are generalities as I'm sure you can find some German ones that match the Alsatian ones in warmer years.

					I lived on the Rhine river for 3 years so I know my German Rieslings quite well, thank you very much, but IMNSHO I think you need more power than what German rieslings can give you. The Alsace is warmer and drier than most of the Riesling growing territory in Germany. Grand Cru Alsatian Rieslings especially give you more "stuff".

					NOMACORC is one of the standard plastic corks out in the market. They have several different products from plonk wine to high end corks that transmit minute amounts of oxygen to slowly age the wine and much easier to pull out of the bottle. The quotes below about plastic corks look like talking points from the natural cork industry. Having said that, I just think plastic corks are a waste. Go to screw caps if are you are going to bottle wine on the cheap
