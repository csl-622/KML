					There are ways of being sneaky, but I would agree with wax eagle; the best answers are going to be around your particular state.  In my particular state, it is legal to have alcohol shipped to my home, which makes the question a little moot.  I would recommend narrowing the question to Kentucky.

					I'm confused about these "in the U.S." questions. They're always gonna be closed because "it depends on the state." But then I've seen questions closed because, "if we allow this, we'd have to allow an identical question for every state (or country)." Which is it? Personally, I think it's perfectly okay to ask about a country, and for someone to answer based on several states and say something like, _"It depends on the state—for example, in New York [...] but in California [...]—so check for similar clauses in your state/municipal laws."_

					@acheong87 the problem in the US is that alcohol laws vary wildly between states and even depending on counties within states. You don't want *one person* asking the same question for 12 states, but limiting it to one or a small handful of states is wise.

					Yea, pretty much. I just went though Beer Advocate's list of Imperial IPA's and cut off anything 8 or below. And I've never had it nor heard of it. I'm not a big IPA fan in general; I prefer Beligian wheats, dubbels, tripels, etc. I like beers with spicy and fruity characteristics, but without the hop overload. Well balanced is what I generally look for in a beer.

					I'm not denying it; I just never really pay attention to the IPA's cuz I'm not into them. But that list is overloaded with IPA's IMO, they should really rate the beers by style. I don't like IPA's with a few rare exceptions, so it doesn't mean much to me that it's their #1.

					A question with a much shorter list might be "What breweries are not brewing a double IPA in the NE US?". It seems like every brewery has at least one. E.G., Victory, in addition to Dirt Wolf also has Hop Wallop (8.5%ABV) and Hop Ranch (9.0%ABV). Thankfully, the tide is starting to turn, and they recently introduced Hop Ticket (4.5%ABV), a "Session IPA"

					Don't forget that the bittering plant used is not always hops: Bog myrtle, (stinging) nettles and a few other weird and wonderful botanicals are used. In fact both of the above were widely used in the UK before hops were introduced.

					it is posible to brew low alcohol beers rather than boiling off. There are a few breweries here in the UK that produce as low as 2.6% ABV beers by brewing alone. They can't boil them off as that would kill the yeast and make them no longer real ales.

					It is hard to imagine this sort of thing would be freely available considering the legal implications. The provider would likely be liable for the consequences of any mistakes, and even if they were able to avoid liability then anyone who used it would need to verify its accuracy. So, in order to safely use such an API you would need to pretty much do all of the work to create it.
