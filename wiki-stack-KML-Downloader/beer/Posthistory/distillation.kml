					Assume I know how to properly ferment grain and distill it into whisky, and that I have all the necessary equipment. If I want a "sour mash" whisky, how would I go about it?

					From a bit of research, it seems that the term "sour mash" simply describes some sort of process where the distiller saves a bit of the old mash (maybe he/she "cultures" it somehow, to grow enough live yeast?) and adds it to a new batch to facilitate fermentation?

					Is there anyone familiar with the process who could describe how to apply it to an existing hypothetical small-batch whisky making operation?

					AFAIK, good distillers discard (or at least reduce) the head (typically the first 5%) of any primary distillation run because it is predominantly less desirable high-VOC compounds.

					Is distillation ever used to remove these "head compounds" from a fermented beverage just to improve its taste?

					For example, if removing the head improves our cognac, wouldn't removing it from otherwise finished wine also improve the wine?

					It's my understanding that distillation produces alcohol to a very high percentage, over 90%. Obviously this doesn't leave a lot of room for flavour compounds. And indeed a lot of white spirit, such as Vodka, is relatively flavourless.

					Some spirits, though, are different. Whiskey made from peated barley retains the smoke flavour of the peat fire, for instance. 

					Perhaps the most extreme example, though, is rum. White rum has a sweetness compared to vodka which must come from the sugar base. Darker rums, like most aged spirits, gets the majority of their flavour from the barrel in which they are matured. However, tasting darker rums reveals a lot of sugar product flavours: caramel, fudge and treacle for example. Presumably these also come from the sugar base and not the barrel yet they're a lot stronger in dark rum than in light.

					Why is this? What governs the flavours that are left behind after distillation and before maturation? Is it different for some spirits than for others - would un-matured whiskey, for example, taste much the same as vodka if not peated?

					As I receive many offers of Latin American spirits and do not have any experience in marketing those (high quality) products I think to buy into an existing distillery with skilled personnel, to use their distribution channels and add further spirits to the existing range of products. 

					But besides sales and distribution channels, what should I pay attention to most?

					Distillation of ethereal oils is made with different pressures and temperatures than distillation of alcohol. So when distilling spirits out of mash directly most of the tastes get lost. I wonder if it could be an idea to distil the natural oils and flavours of fruits (ingredients) before fermentation and add those components later to the product to conserve a stronger taste of the ingredients used.

					Has somebody tried that out?
