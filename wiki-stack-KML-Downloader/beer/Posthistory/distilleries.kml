					We all know that the some [Trappist][1] monasteries produce their famous [Trappist beer][2]. A little less know fact is that the [Carthusian][3] monks at the [Grande Chartreuse][4] in France produces their world famous  [Chartreuse liqueur][5].

					My question is quite simple: Are there any other Catholic monasteries or Religious Orders that produce any other alcoholic beverages available to be bought by the general public?

					I am not asking for alcoholic beverages that are named after some Religious Order or personage like [Frangelico][6].

					Seeking online sources where companies offer free labels for their products (beer, wine or other spirits)?

					A few years ago I discovered that Crown Royal offers free custom made labels (restriction do apply). The labels fit right over the original labels in such a way that no one could tell the the original one were still on the bottle. I had much fun buying some Crown Royal with custom labels put in them at Christmas time. The looks we got when they read the labels were truly amazing.

					Today I was looking at buying my first bottle of whiskey since I got a liquor store gift card worth of $50. I enjoy whiskey so I figured this would be nice to buy. I was looking at for example Blanton's Bourbon and after doing some research, I found out that Blanton's Bourbon is marketed by Sazerac Company and distilled at Buffalo Trace. After looking further, I found out there are only about 13 actual distilleries in the USA which most of them produce multiple brands.

					**question:** 

					Take my Blanton's example. What does it actually mean that it is done by multiple companies? Does this mean I can also just buy a bottle of Buffalo Trace whiskey for the same taste and pay less? Also, who gets to decide the taste, if it's different at all? Blanton's or the distillery itself? I'm kind of confused at this moment and before I spend my gift card I'd like to get some clarification of why things are done this way. Right now I feel like the "sub brands" like Blanton just buys from Buffalo and call it their own, I don't want to spend my gift card on a... well... sort of "fake" product that's just a marketing trick, if that makes sense! Hope someone can clear things up for me. Thanks in advance!

					The [method to produce Sherry][1] and the respective Brandy uses four layers of barrels. From the lowest layer they take the annual amount they want to sell and refill from the respective layer above. The Layer on top is refilled with the newest production. So every Sherry and Brandy produced in this way contains at least four year old wine or spirits, but also much older components of the first year of production, which means that you may expect a drop of first production year in each bottle. ;)

					This is why you will not find a year of  grape harvest on the bottle lables.

					However, I do not know any other winery or distillery working in that way. I know some that finally blend (mix) different products, but that is not the same.

					The [method to produce Sherry][1] and the respective Brandies, called [Solera][2], uses several layers of barrels (frequently four layers). From the lowest layer they take the annual amount they want to sell and refill from the respective layer above. The layer on top is refilled with the newest production. So every Sherry and Brandy produced in this way contains at least (four?) year old wine or spirits, but also much older components of the first year of production, which means that you may expect a drop of first production year in each bottle. ;)

					As I receive many offers of Latin American spirits and do not have any experience in marketing those (high quality) products I think to buy into an existing distillery with skilled personnel, to use their distribution channels and add further spirits to the existing range of products. 

					But besides sales and distribution channels, what should I pay attention to most?
