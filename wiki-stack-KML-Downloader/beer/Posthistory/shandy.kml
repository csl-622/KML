					I was recently at a local craft beer festival and I tried a few shandys (my favorite was [Time Traveler][1] and now I'm starting to get into them as well. But I've heard mixed things about their history. Some people say it goes back hundreds of years and others say it's a much more recent phenomena. With that said, why do they have such a bad reputation? They always seem to score low on beeradvocate and ratebeer. To me it seems as though people are rating them as beers rather than what they actually are, shandys.
