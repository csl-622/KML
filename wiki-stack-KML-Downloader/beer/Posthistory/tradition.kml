					[St Patrick's Day][1] is celebrated every year on March 17. It brings back those old Irish stories and legends that abound with this Saint.

					We all know of some of that traditional Irish drinks that people drink on the Feast of St Patrick, such as [Irish Coffee][2] or drinking [Green Beer][3].

					Are there any other St Patrick's Day drinking traditions celebrated on this day?

					February is in the Catholic world the Feast of [St Valentine][1] (226-269),from where we get the traditions involved with [Valentine's Day][2] as well the Feast of [St Vincent of Saragossa][3], who died in 304.

					On [Burns Night][1] it is traditional to have a 'wee dram' to drink with your [Haggis][2].  I am serving Haggis to some Scottish friends, and as it is not Burns Night I feel that I can forgo the traditions of whiskey with Haggis and serve another spirit/wine.  What would be a good alcohol pairing for Haggis?

					Is it possible to know where, when  and how the custom of clinking glasses (usually filled with beer or wine) originated, while saying "cheers" or "to your health"? Do any historical documents support a possible origin?

					Many of us here will follow this tradition at times like New Year's Day, Christmas, weddings and so on.
