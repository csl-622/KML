					Some days ago I was walking on the street and passed by a beverage store where I saw some bottles of absinthe.

					There were green, red and blue versions, and I thought how could absinthe, a classically green colored beverage, be transformed into a totally different color; and what's more, a _primary_ color which is supposed to be impossible to create by mixing other colors.

					I have two theories: 

					 - Absinthe is always green due to the presence of _Artemisia absinthium_'s chlorophyll. The beverage is based in and some kind of product is added in order to create a reaction to make it turn to X color. 

					 - Absinthe is transparent until you add the _Artemisia absinthium_'s chlorophyll. Somehow, you can add colorant to the transparent beverage and eliminate the chlorophyll.
