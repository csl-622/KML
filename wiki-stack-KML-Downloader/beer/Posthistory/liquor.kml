					These days I drink almost as much liquor as I do beer, and it seems like beer more commonly causes sleepiness and fatigue, where liquor gives a straight up 'drunken' effect.

					I wonder, though, is this actually the case or is my perception of the two drinks a self fulfilling prophecy?

					I was in Libramont back when I was roaming around Belgium. And hitting a pub next to station where people were having lunch, I ordered a Rodenbach beer (http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/216/1882/) and the bartender says that I should drink it with a cherry shot. 

					 - **Is that normal to drink Rodenbach beer with a cherry shot?**

					 - **Has it got to do with the Rodenbach red before Palm brewery bought over Rodenbach?**

					 - **Has cherry or cherry liquor has anything to do with Rodenbach brewery or beer history?**

					Having watched a few episodes of the Discovery Channel reality-show "Moonshiners" (which I find quite amusing, but it should better be called "America's Most Stupid Rednecks"), I'm somewhat surprised about a number of things shown on there (relating to making alcohol, not to the "be a really stupid guy" stuff which is probably done by professional actors).

					I've been a hobby winemaker for about a decade, and I'm assuming that if one produces a TV show about a topic, then one has hired at least a consultant to get the most striking facts approximately right. But I'm really wondering here.

					- Setting up mash means dropping some corn and water into an ugly barrel, and add a sack full of sugar (like... 25 kilograms?), this gives you alcohol ready to distill in two, at most three days. Old barrel with wooden lid, no fermentation lock needed.  
					In winemaking, while adding sugar is often frowned upon anyway, regardless of what you do, you generally try hard **not** to get the sugar contents too high at the beginning since that _inhibits_ fermentation. Using any old barrel for fermentation is... well, something you _can_ probably do, but would one want to?

					- 20 liters distilled give 8 liters of 50-55% moonshine. Since alcohol does not appear out of nowhere, this means the mash must necessarily have 20% of alcohol. That's quite steep for a random mix of stuffs in an old barrel. My yeast usually tolerates 16-18% at most. Admitted, there are special high-alcohol yeasts as well as "turbo" yeasts, but they make no mention of any such thing.

					- You get mash ready to distill in two days (20% in 2 days, that's, well... wow) but if you heat it up to around 70°C (so, basically killing the yeast!), you can do it in hours, not days.

					- Using a "booster" which is basically a second cooling spiral in a box, doubles the amount of alcohol you get out. As does a cooling spiral in the main tank (with some special word that I forgot... blahblah-ator).  
					Since the booster cannot possibly create alcohol out of nowhere, does that mean that one normally operates at below 50% efficiency?

					- Making the distill from copper is useful because it aborbs the large amounts of sulfur dioxide that are generated during fermentation. More copper, more good.  
					In winemaking, if you get noticeable amounts of sulfur dioxide, it means you fucked up the fermentation (except when making fruit wine from oranges, there it's pretty common).

					- Malted corn needs no yeast for fermentation, and you get no headaches from it that way. I'm inclined to believe the opposite as far as headaches go, since no yeast means you run a wild fermentation. In winemaking, this is normally something that you absolutely want to avoid if you can help it. Wild fermentation, and rapid, ultra-high alcohol production?

					- Moonshine sells for 25-30 dollars per liter. Not sure about alcohol prices in the USA, but I can buy alcohol _legally_ (and not made from river water in a dirty barrel) for that amount of money here.

					So, is there anything in there which (apart from running when police shows up) is even remotely realistic?

					I'm not familiar with the bar scene - I have been drinking mostly at home so that I don't have to worry about driving afterwards. However, recently I found a nice bar in the area I moved to and would like to try going out once in a while. What type of drink should I order if I want to hangout at the bar for one hour after 11 pm? I see many folks getting cocktails like such as margaritas and martinis, but is it against the norm to order beer, wine, or shots? 

					I do not plan to have dinner. The bar is mellow and catered to young adults - the clientele is older than freshman college students.

					I've successfully made a black raspberry liqueur, and am doing a similar process now with fresh figs. Has anybody done that? What have your experiences been?

					Recipe:

					 - 1.5 cups vodka (I'm using Tito's)
					 - 1.5 - 2 cups fig puree

					Combine figs and vodka, shake well, store in refrigerator. Shake daily, after 2-3 weeks strain well, and add simple syrup to taste.

					In a home bar, the rate of consumption is (in theory at least...) a lot less than for a commercial bar. This means proper storage of ingredients becomes a much more important question, as bottles will stick around for months or years.

					What's the best way to store liquor to ensure each bottle does not go bad?

					What impact do light, temperature, humidity, and other factors play in this?

					Are there any particular alcohols (e.g., vermouths) that should be stored differently?

					From Wikipedia:

					&gt; Pálinka is a traditional fruit brandy in the Carpathian Basin, known under several names, and invented in the Middle Ages. Protected as a geographical indication of the European Union, only fruit spirits mashed, distilled, matured and bottled in Hungary and similar apricot spirits from four provinces of Austria can be called "pálinka". 

					The question is, how is this spirit most commonly consumed in this region? Is it usually drunk neat/on rocks or do Hungarians usually mix it into cocktails?

					People put the strangest things in bottles of liquor to be sold commercially. We have all probably heard of liquor stores, pubs or other drinking establishments occasionally selling tequila with a worm in the bottle. Be what the history of the [mescal worm][1] is: true or false is not my question.

					The other day, I was in a local liquor store and noticed bottle of liquor called [Eau de Vie de Poire in the Bottle][2] with a real full sized pear inside the bottle containing 40% (ABV) of pear brandy. One can see how they get the pear in a bottle [here][3] and [here][4].  

					[![Eau de Vie de Poire Pear In The Bottle][5]][5] 

					 *[Eau de Vie de Poire Pear In The Bottle][6]*

					My question is quite simple: What other things are sold in bottles of liquor or liqueur commercially other than fruit or possibly worms (tequila)?

					[Strip 10 of the Eavesdropper comic strip][c] shows a small bar with a sequence of seven liquor bottles on a shelf.  Can you identify them?  

					[![enter image description here][i]][c]

					The comic strip apparently has a series of puzzles, with one puzzle encoding a word found on each page of the comic strip (except for the first few pages).  We don't yet know where the puzzles are going, but then the comic only has 18 pages so far out of approximately 100 planned.  

					We have already identified a few of those bottles, see my answer.
