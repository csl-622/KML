KML Compressor
==============
These programs compresses and decompresses a KML file using diff algorithm inspired from git. 

compressed_kml_generetor.py
===========================
It can compress the KML file by 30% or more depending upon the edits made on an article. The compressed KML is also very easy to read, since the number of lines is reduced from 1 lakh to 9k and it retains the original structure of the KML so that it remains redable even when compressed.

nth_revision_generetor.py
=========================
It generates the nth decompressed revision from the compressed kml file.
