Encoder.py
==========

This program accurately detects the changes between two text
files and then appends these changes to revision file. You 
can add multiple revisions, clean the revisions and see the
contents of revision file on terminal.

Decoder.py
==========

Using the original article and the revision file containing 
datastructures for the revisions we can generate any asked
version of the article which is printed on the terminal.

Files used
==========
article.txt: Original article
edit1.txt: First edited version of article.txt
edit2.txt: Second edited version of article.txt
edit3.txt: Third edited version of article.txt
revision: Stores the compressed form of revisions

How to test the code
====================
Note: You the file name for original article is hard-coded to be
article.txt for convinience of running the program.

We have initially 4 files article.txt, edit1.txt, edit2.txt, edit3.txt

We will then use encoder.py to store the edits in compressed form
in the revision file. First run the script, you would be given two
options either to add a revision or clean the revisions. If you are
using it for first time clean all the revisions by entering 2.
Then you can add revisions by selecting first option and entering the
file name of edit for example edit1.txt.

Then we will use decoder.py to get readable form of articles using the
revision file and the original article. When you run the file, you
would be given the number of revisions present in the revision file.
you can select the nth revision by entering n.
